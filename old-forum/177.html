<DIV>I am reading through the WebServices chapter in the book. We basically create a struct for Project and resource objects. If I am not mistaken, in the UpdateResource method we get a resourceInfo struct, which has a string property called role. Here we just assume that the role the user passed in is the right one?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>How would the user application know what are the available roles in our system? I am thinking of expose the list of available roles as well in my webservice. So that the user can bind this list to a combo or whatever interface he uses and will send in a roleId in the resourceInfo struct.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Could anyone please tell me, what is the best way to expose a NameValueList in the WebService. Should I create another struct containing RoleId, roleName and then expose as a collection of this struct?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thank You</DIV>
