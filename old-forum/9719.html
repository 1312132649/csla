<p>We have a winforms project and a web project that use csla 3.6 objects (existing code). We updated the same code from them into Csla 4.0.1 and implemented the 3 file method splitting up the Server, Common and Client cs files in a Silverlight 4 version of the project.</p>
<p>First off, let me say that everything is working properly. We get all of our results, but there we are experiencing poor performance, especially on older machines running a P4 2.8ghz 1.25 gigs of RAM.</p>
<p>As an example, on one Silverlight UserControl, we have cascading combo boxes. When you select an item from the combo, a method on the ViewModel calls a csla object that get the list from the server and via databinding the second combobox populates based on the first combobox selection. We have this same thing running in BOTH winforms and web (web version works via Ajax). On windows and web the second combobox populates almost instantly. Even on the web the Ajax call is so fast, by the time you drop down the second combobox it&#39;s already populated. However, the Silverlight 4 version takes a couple seconds. On the P4 machine it can take up to 5 seconds. We have a call center with customers on the phone and 5 seconds every time an option needs to be changed adds up quickly.</p>
<p>If anyone has experienced this, or if anyone has any suggestions, we would appreciate it. So far, we have not been able to solve this.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jeff</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, November 05, 2010</h2><p>Have you enabled compression for the WCF communication with the server?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
