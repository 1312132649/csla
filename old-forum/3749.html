<P>I am trying to understand the responsibility-driven design and I have a question.</P>
<P>Lets say we have two BOs, Sale (Date, Reference etc)&nbsp;and SaleItem (Price, Quantity etc). We need to get sale total. Both these objects came into being due to Add/Edit Sale use-case. </P>
<P>I am trying to assign responsibility of getting sale total to some BO. My question really is that Sale and SaleItem are responsible, at the moment, to load data and&nbsp;save validated data (much like ProjectTracker BOs). Now this new responsibility of calculating sale total, where should I put this?</P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I wouldn't put it on SaleItem, because (a) each SaleItem object for&nbsp;a sale&nbsp;would have the same value, and (b) each SaleItem would need to be able to access every other SaleItem in the aforementioned collection in order to get the value.&nbsp; Since the collection already has access to all the SaleItem objects...</FONT></P>
