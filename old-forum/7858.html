<P>The forum is the ideal place for feedback, because it allows the community to provide input.</P>
<P>But the forum isn't ideal for bugs because I don't always see them - I don't always have the time to read every post. So it is now possible for a guest to submit an issue into the issue tracker.</P>
<P>If that becomes a vector for spam I'll have to shut it down, but hopefully the UI is obscure enough (go look - it is pretty obscure...) so the bad guys don't think it is worth the effort.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Henrik replied on Friday, October 23, 2009</h2>“If that becomes a vector for spam I'll have to shut it down, but hopefully the UI is obscure enough (go look - it is pretty obscure...) so the bad guys don't think it is worth the effort.”<br /><br />I just love this sentence. Sometimes I use the same technique when building applications for my customers. Build an input form so complex, that only the people that use it everyday can figure it out, but any prying managers are lost and just thinks it’s a marvel. (no ofcourse I don’t do that ;-)<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, October 24, 2009</h2><P>Fortunately in this case it isn't my UI - it is an open source bugtracker tool, so I can blame them :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 11, 2009</h2><P>Well, today the bugtracker became a vector for spam. Amazing to think that it would be worth figuring out this software just to put up a bunch of crap...</P>
<P>Anyway, there's no longer an open bug reporting capability thanks to the evil-doers out there.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jimbo replied on Thursday, November 12, 2009</h2>The bug tracking Url link needs to be provided on the main Forum page<br>jimbo<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Thursday, November 12, 2009</h2>I&nbsp;missed this post :)<BR>It would be nice to vote for an existing issue as well, just like codeplex offers.<BR><BR>A blinking link in the top of the html "Add an issue" would be better as an link on the home page.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, November 12, 2009</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>That&#8217;s a great suggestion &#8211; you should suggest that to the

It would be nice to vote for an existing issue as well, just like codeplex
offers.<br>
<br>
A blinking link in the top of the html &quot;Add an issue&quot; would be better
as an link on the home page.<br>
