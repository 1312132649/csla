<p>What is the scenario where you want to manually execute the rule?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Wayne Hiller replied on Friday, May 14, 2010</h2><p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>Ya I noticed that when I dug though the code. I had an Extended Rule system where I could add a broken rule at runtime and have it show up in the error indicators in a data grid. I have since found a better way to do it though.</p>
<p>I have changed a number of projects over to CSLA 4 and everything is going fine so far. I did have some problems with Members causing an error in DynamicMethodHandlerFactory.CreateFieldSetter(FieldInfo field). Something about The Left side of the Expression had to be writable. This error was fired when calling BeginEdit on an object in WinForms. I stopped the errors by adding [NotUndoable] to the members in my base class. I can give you more info if you need it.</p>
<div>P.S.</div>
<p>I&#39;m going to my first VSLive in Redmond in Aug. Can&#39;t wait, gonna ride my chopper up there from CA. Of course I will have to attend most of your classes.</p>

<p>I look forward to meeting you in Redmond!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
