<p>That creates a problem in that you can&#39;t select the &quot;Save&quot; button until you have exited the field.</p>
<p>Which means the user can enter some data to change a field, but can&#39;t select save unless they artificially click on (or tab to) another field.</p>
<p>Is this a limitation of WPF, or is there another event that will trigger the correct behavior?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried the basic TextChanged event, but haven&#39;t figured out how to implement it and certainly don&#39;t want to duplicate something that&#39;s already done somewhere else.</p>
