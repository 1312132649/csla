<p>Obviously it isn&#39;t a big deal to remove these properties from anything that I databind against, but I&#39;m wondering if there is an attribute or something that I can apply to the property so it is ignored by the datasource?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, February 21, 2010</h2><p>In Windows Forms and WPF you can use the Browsable attribute from System.ComponentModel to &quot;hide&quot; properties from data binding. I don&#39;t know if Web Forms honors that attribute or not, but that&#39;d be the attribute you&#39;d want.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cmay replied on Monday, February 22, 2010</h2><p>That same attribute seems to work with the CslaDataSource in asp.net too thanks.</p>
<p>I also double checked that databinding was still possible on that property, and it was, so this just prevents the grid from having these extra columns by default, when you first setup databinding, which is exactly what I wanted.&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
