<p>My problem is: I have a very large object graph that I need to transport and I&#39;m using clsa 1.5 &nbsp;with .Net 1.1 (sorry I can&#39;t change to a later version this is production code).</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking for some input on how I can overcome this problem. It&#39;s an urgent matter so if anyone has any ideas please post them.</p>
<p>Ok, so far, I&#39;ve been through the forum and there is quite a bit of information for later technology but not the stoneage stuff.</p>
<p>thanks in anticipation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, years ago there was a small Russian company that had a Remoting channel that did compression. If they still exist, or if their product is out there somewhere, it might help you.</p>
<p>Otherwise you&#39;ll need to rework the data portal code to meet your needs. You can borrow some ideas from CSLA 2.0 or later I&#39;m sure.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Wednesday, August 11, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Rocky. Appreciate your quick response. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll have to have a look at reworking the data portal as there is not much chance of moving to a later Clsa version anytime soon.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, August 11, 2010</h2><p>Conceptually the easiest thing to do is what I did with the asmx implementation in 2.0 - where the service interface works on byte arrays. That allows (requires) you to run the BinaryFormatter yourself on client and server, and thereby allows you to just run the resulting byte stream through the compression engine of your choice.</p>
<p>You should be able to use much of the existing data portal proxy and host code as a model - just change the host public methods to accept and produce byte arrays, and change the client-side proxy code to do the same.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
