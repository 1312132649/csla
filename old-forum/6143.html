If I replace PropertyHasChanged with MarkDirty, then I have the desired behavior (single Tab to exit field).</P>
<P>I have tried PropertyHasChanged with and without&nbsp;ValidationRules with no effect.</P>
<P>I am using CLSA.Net 2.1.4 and am still having this problem after upgrading from 2.0. I run ProjectTracker without this issue. I have compared by classes with similar projecttrascker classes and cannot see a difference.</P>
<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated (please don't tell me it fixed in 3.5 because it does not compile for .Net 2.0.)</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>Fortunately it is also fixed in 3.0.5, which compiles fine for .NET 2.0 and is the current release for .NET 2.0.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>andrewrajcoomar replied on Tuesday, January 13, 2009</h2><P>Thanks for the quick reply, Rocky. </P>
<P>I must be missing something because I can't get CSLA 3.05 (Release 3.05-081009) to compile. I am on ASP.Net 2.0 framework. Do not have any WCF components installed.</P>
<P>I tried compiling ProjectTracker as well as the core solution cslavb, no success. I'm not allowed to upgrade .Net framework, right now, or install additional components.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>Originally I was returning my PK property, but that's null during an Insert because it's an identity column in SQL and is set to auto-increment.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
