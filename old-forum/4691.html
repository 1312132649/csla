<P>Error&nbsp;2&nbsp;Task failed because "AL.exe" was not found, or the correct Microsoft Windows SDK is not installed. The task is looking for "AL.exe" in the "bin" subdirectory beneath the location specified in the InstallationFolder value of the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A. You may be able to solve the problem by doing one of the following:&nbsp; 1) Install the Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5.&nbsp; 2) Install Visual Studio 2008.&nbsp; 3) Manually set the above registry key to the correct location.&nbsp; 4) Pass the correct location into the "ToolPath" parameter of the task.&nbsp;Csla<BR></P>
<P>I've checked the registry and I didn't have any Windows\v6.0A key at that path.&nbsp; I've installed VS2008 (prior to encountering this error and would rather wait to reinstall as a last resort).&nbsp; And I tried creating the registry key with the path to AL.exe and that doesn't work either.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyone else come across this problem?</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR>David Martin</P>
