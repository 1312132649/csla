That's not the job of the business layer.</P>
<P>But the UI should ask the business layer for any business information. In other words, the presentation layer <EM>should</EM> ask the object if all is good.</P>
<P>You should be able to do this immediatley following the Save() though, without the need to call the factory method to reload the object. Remember that Save() returns an updated instance of the object as a result of the save operation:</P>
<P>&nbsp; _object = _object.Save();</P>
<P>If you use this approach, you can immediately ask _object about its status, thus enabling your UI to update the display accordingly.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
