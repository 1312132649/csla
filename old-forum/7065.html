<P>In the meantime, I've been playing around with the Project Tracker sample to get a feel for it.</P>
<P>Is there any way to avoid including server-side code (e.g. LINQ to SQL for Fetch) in the&nbsp;business objects so the client-side doesn't get this code deployed?&nbsp; The Project Tracker app uses partial classes and *.Server.cs files to better partition the database access code, but they are still part of the assembly that is distributed to the client.</P>
<P>I'm not planning on using the .NET client-only framework (at this point, anyway), but it would be nice at some point, and I know they disallow server technologies like LINQ to SQL in that (which makes sense).&nbsp; Aside from that, I like to encapsulate my LINQ to SQL code in "data manager" assemblies anyway, and I don't want these on the client side.</P>
<P>Thanks for any help.</P>

Video #6 is almost 109 minutes dedicated to different data access technologies and organization code.<br><br>/jonny<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>LParker replied on Wednesday, June 10, 2009</h2><P>Thanks, I appreciate the help.</P>
