<P>I searched the fora and found some general&nbsp;answers about backwards compatibility but not exactly what i was&nbsp;looking for. Let me state my case :</P>
<P>We are currently starting a new project and have decided to use the csla.net framework. The development is going to take at leats one and a half years.</P>
<P>Which version of csla.net should we use in this case ? I saw that 3.0 beta2 is closing it's bug reporting on july 5th does this mean that the full release will be soon ?</P>
<P>And if we would first start out with version 2.1,&nbsp;which breaking changes&nbsp;could we encounter when upgrading to version 3.0.</P>
<P>In short im wondering what you would advise as the best thing to do at the moment.</P>
<P>Hope to hear from you soon.</P>
<P>With regards,<BR>&nbsp; Robertjan Tuit</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 09, 2007</h2><P>Version 3.0 will be out very, very&nbsp;soon.</P>
<P>Moving from 2.1.4 to 3.0 should be relatively painless. </P>
<P>The only known issue you should face are the fact that 3.0 throws exceptions when n-level undo edit levels get out of sync. This indicates a bug in the UI code, and a lot of Windows Forms apps have bugs there. So this is a <EM>good thing</EM>, in that it helps you find/fix nasty bugs, but may be a hurdle as you upgrade.</P>
<P>Personally I'd go with 3.0, as it includes some important bug fixes over 2.1.4, along with some nice new features (not even counting the .NET 3.0 support).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>esteban404 replied on Wednesday, July 11, 2007</h2><P>I'm glad to see this thread. I've been away and have a new ASP.NET project (pro bono,&nbsp;no less)&nbsp;that's a good fit for CSLA. So I need to get from&nbsp;1.53 to 3 quickly. Does anyone have any suggestions for streamlining my retraining? Launch will not be until December or January, but it's a challenge.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance,</P>
