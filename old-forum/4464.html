I was have an application that uses addins where the BO's are actually defined in the addins. I figured CSLA would work great since the BO's can be sent across the app domains but there are additional restrictions with system.addin. I just thought I would&nbsp;ask the community before I went on a wild goose chase.</P>

The System.addin was geared toward using a lot of remoting features which ultimately would have limited my application. I opted to disregard the benefits of addins running in thier own appdomain for the benefits of having rich addins.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
