<P>I've a collection that has children - but in order for the collection to be valid the children must add up to a certain number (on several properties).&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I do this if the BusinessListBase doesn't support any kind of validation?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, November 29, 2006</h2>There are two ways to do this.<br><br>One is to override IsValid on the collection, which runs through the collection checking the 'collection rules.'<br><br>Another is to have a rule on the businessbase object, which knows its in a collection and checks the collection.<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Wednesday, November 29, 2006</h2>Any practical recommendations either way?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, November 29, 2006</h2>It depends on what you need to do.<br><br>If you need a broken rule object to tell you why the collection is invalid, I would go the second route.&nbsp; If you just want to know without being able to obtain the details, the first method is just as valid.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Thursday, November 30, 2006</h2>If the list is itself a child, the parent object could also have a a rule that is checked whenever one of the corresponding property of a child in the list changes.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 01, 2006</h2>You could do that, but then you are coupling the parent to a particular child implementation.&nbsp; That's why I left that off my list; a class can know about itself, that's fine, and usually the collection class will only hold a particular concrete class anyway, so you're already coupled in that sense.&nbsp; I wouldn't recommend putting the rule in the parent though because of the coupling it would cause.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
