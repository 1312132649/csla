If total qty is say 5000 and breakdwon is in 2 rows of 2500 each then any change should run the validation rules..<br /><br />I'm currently using listchanged event and validation is working but sometimes due to short circuiting feature, validation rules are not triggered..<br /><br />For the time being, i'm manually putting a dummy value and changing it back to original value to force the check but this is not the right way..<br /><br />How i can complete disable the short circuiting part so it shud get executed all the time..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, August 18, 2009</h2>I though you had to set things up to short circuit, because it should run all the rules by default.<br /><br />You might also consider changing the priorities of certain rules, so that the always run ones are at 0, and the others an be higher.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Tuesday, August 18, 2009</h2>i also thought the same but somehow this is not happenning.. <br /><br />i will just go through my code again and post back the final comments..<br /><br />Kindly note throughout this po, i have not set any priorities so all are having default value of 0..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, August 18, 2009</h2><P>Sometimes I override IsValid and call specific rules like: CheckRules("Qty") to re-run any rules that need to be checked before determining if the BO is valid or not.</P>
<P>I do exactly this for my PO Line BO which has a Splits collection of split line BOs. So if the line has a qty of 5000 and the Splits colelction has two records of 2500 each the Qty&nbsp;rule in the PO Line BO will get re-run whenever you ask it if itis valid or not. That rule will compare the sum of the qty in the splits collection to the Qty in the PO Line.</P>
