I suppose that every permission in full trust is not needed and it should be possible to run with some of them removed. Medium trust is not enough in most situations of what I have understood.<br><br>Can someone please explain which permissions are needed and which are not?<br><br>Thanks<br>Niklas<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
