We are currently using Clsa 1.5 with a web server. I have looked at creating an instance of the TransactionManager (see attached diagram), also some sort of win service on an application server and posting xml packets to it. Then I thought of hosting some sort of singleton bo so I don't have to make instances and get the overhead that goes with it. I need to be able to create transactions on both the client and server sides.</P>
<P>So if anyone has done something like this or has any advice or suggestions I'd be really happy to hear from you.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance, as this is becoming a bit critical.</P>

<P>Creating a singleton that services multiple concurrent clients requires making it threadsafe, which is complex, bug-prone and can be very expensive (in terms of both development cost and performance).</P>
<P>Are you sure you really want a singleton?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Wednesday, October 01, 2008</h2><P>Thanks Rocky</P>
<P>Ok, so for now I'll just go with instance objects so I can get something working. Then look at host it externally, and maybe multiple instances so it can handle the load.</P>
