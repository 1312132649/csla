I have added a Sever Library and a Client Library.  In the Server Library I have the MyProject.cs and MyProject.Server.cs.  Server Library references cslacs and Client Library references cslalightcs.  <br /><br />The problem is with the MyProject.cs The Using statements in the file are as in the Video (System, Csla, Csla.Serialization).  The code in MyProject.cs is basically Business Methods, BusinessRules, Business Authorization regions.  Everything compiles just fine until I include the MyProject.cs in the Client Library As a Link.  The Build action after that gives me 4 puzzeling errors - all four referring to the Client Library.  The Errors are:<br /><br />1. 'SerializableAttribute' is an ambiguous reference between 'System.SerializableAttribute' and 'Csla.Serialization.SerializableAttribute'<br />2. The type or namespace name 'Serializable' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)<br />3. The type 'System.ComponentModel.IEditableObject' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System, Version=2.0.5.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e'.<br />4. The type 'System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System, Version=2.0.5.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e'<br /><br />Obviously I am doing something wrong but I cannot figure out what.<br />Thanks for the help.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, October 12, 2009</h2><P>Make sure you reference the correct Csla.dll in each project.</P>
<P>The Silverlight class library must reference the Silverlight Csla.dll, and the .NET class library must reference the .NET Csla.dll.</P>
<P>One way to narrow down the compile issues is to explicitly compile each project - right click on the project in Solution Explorer and say to build just that one project. I often find it challenging to figure out which project is failing to compile when building the whole solution, especially with this type of issue.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Monday, October 12, 2009</h2>After comparing my Solution with the SimpleApp sample brick by brick, I discovered that the Type of my ClientLibrary project was wrong.  I was using a Windows Class Library.  When I deleted the project and created a new one of the type Siverlight Class Library, all errors have disappeared.<br /><br />Thanks Rocky</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skumarsamy replied on Wednesday, September 21, 2011</h2><p>Hi, </p>
<p>I too have the same issue. I just use the same SimpleApp as model and created a sampeapp, in my server side business object whe i tried to use <span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;">Serializable, this one refers to System.<span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;">Serializable, not from Csal.Serialization. I tested all my libraries Csla from .NET, Client library has Csla from Silverlight, but unable to clear the issue. I tried to build individual projects has the same issue.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>You need to be <em>very</em> careful to use the right project types, and to reference the correct Csla.dll for .NET and for Silverlight (because they are not the same).</p>
<ul>
<li>Silverlight projects need to reference the Silverlight Csla.dll. </li>
<li>.NET projects need to reference the .NET Csla.dll.</li>
<li>Silverlight projects should only reference other Silverlight projects.</li>
<li>.NET projects should only reference other .NET projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just out of curiosity, would a version of CSLA for WinRT avoid these issue?&nbsp;&nbsp; Shouldn&#39;t we be able to us the same library on the client and on the server side of an asynchronous operation?&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably too early to tell, but it&#39;s a delightful thought.</p>
<div style="CLEAR:both;"></div>
</div></p>
<p>Sadly no. In fact, it goes the other way. We&#39;ll have yet another version of Csla.dll to support WinRT, because it is a new platform - somewhat similar to SL, but definitely not the same...&nbsp;See this blog post: <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLAOnWinRTProjectStart.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLAOnWinRTProjectStart.aspx</a></p>
<p>And we&#39;ll have a Csla.dll for .NET 4.5, just like we have one for .NET 4 today. In fact it won&#39;t change much (the .NET one) other than to support some of the new 4.5 features. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>INotifyDataErrorInfo is now in WPF (it is in SL today)</li>
<li>async/await keywords in C# 5 and VB 11</li>
<li>Web Forms data binding enhancements</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC enhancements</li>
</ul>
<p>And the existing Csla.dll for SL will continue to exist (but for SL5 of course), along with the one for WP7.5, and the one for iOS, and for Android, and for mono.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
