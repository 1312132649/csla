<P>1. .NET 3.0 isn't really an upgraded version of the .NET framework and, in my opinion, needs to be renamed back to it's original name: WinFX.&nbsp; This name is misleading to the developer community who are going to think that this replaces .NET 2.0 as we have all become accustomed to with traditional software versioning practices.&nbsp; Instead, .NET 3.0 ADDS to .NET 2.0 and actually relies upon .NET 2.0 - can't run it without .NET 2.0.&nbsp; This is a marketing ploy by MS that I strongly disagree with.</P>
<P>2. WCF, WPF and WCS portions of .NET 3.0 should be made part of the base framework (and may eventually be) as they are the new API's for dealing with the new Windows platforms starting with Windows Vista.&nbsp; WCF replaces COM, etc.; WPF provides support for the new graphics engine; and, WCS is the new security model.&nbsp; These are natural extensions to the existing framework and fit within the intent of the framework.&nbsp; My guess is that they will be there eventually but MS needed to get this out to us (developers) now to coincide with the release of Vista and couldn't wait for the REAL .NET 3.0 to be ready.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the WF portion of .NET 3.0 doesn't belong there.&nbsp; I believe WF is an SDK and should be relegated as such.&nbsp; Or even an Enterprise Library component.&nbsp; this is MS trying to dictate HOW to build an application rather than providing the building blocks for us to use as we see fit.&nbsp; It is inconsistent with the rest of the framework and should not be directly coupled with it.</P>
<P>3. Finally, a comment by presenter Juval Lowy who stated emphatically and repeatedly that under NO circumstances should we make use of remoting in our applications.&nbsp; (This is what lead me to posting this.)&nbsp; Obviously this hits home with CSLA and the entire data portal concept is based on remoting.&nbsp; So, aside from the expected banter about the agreement or disagreement with my assertions in the first two points, I would like to throw this one into the foray for discussion.&nbsp; If not remoting, then what are we supposed to use?&nbsp; WCF?&nbsp; What about prior to WCF?&nbsp; And, Rocky, do you have plans to upgrade CSLA to make use of these new "tools"?</P>

<P>From what I saw of the .NET 3.0 stuff, it all looks very slick and is built directly on top of the .NET 2.0 framework.&nbsp; So the fact that they've re-branded it as .NET 3.0 instead of WinFX I think is a good move.&nbsp; My personal opinion.</P>
<P>And yes, these technologies now have great-sounding marketing names (Windows Presentation Foundation - wow <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" />) and a great-sounding marketing umbrella name (.NET 3.0&nbsp;- wow <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" />).</P>
<P>But I think that gives a much clearer picture than the "WinFX" name did.</P>
<P>And don't forget that these "brand names" are not just aimed at the developer community, they're aimed at IT infrastructure support people as well.&nbsp; So for support teams it is an easy concept to pick up as a simple progression of version numbers (.NET 1.0 =&gt; .NET 1.1 =&gt;&nbsp;.NET 2.0 =&gt;&nbsp;.NET 3.0).</P>
<P>I don't think the developer community will get confused with the name change either, since we're already used to working with the 3 existing different flavours of the .NET framework.</P>
<P>And at the end of the day, the framework is only there as a starting point.&nbsp; If you don't want to use Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF) then don't use it.&nbsp; It's the same as the System.CodeDom namespace in the current .NET framework - it's there if you want, but you don't have to use it.</P>
<P>Personally, I'm quite excited by the idea of a workflow engine where you can "draw" the workflow relationship between "workflow entity" classes that you've built yourself.&nbsp; It certainly offers up the potential to model Business Processes more flexibily than we can currently.</P>

</div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>Juval and I are good friends, and we tend to agree on most things in principle and disagree on most things in detail <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />&nbsp; We have some of the best discussions!<br><br>It is important to remember that mobile objects is not the trendy thing right now. Service-orientation is the trendy thing. Fortunately for SO, no one can define it, so no one knows how limited it really is in practice and so it appears to be the "silver bullet". Like all technologies, SO will mature to the point that it becomes defined, and then used, and then its limitations will be all too clear.<br><br>Juval happens to be an SO junky - and there's absolutely no room in the SO universe for concepts like mobile objects... <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /><br><br>In general terms he's right. Remoting isn't the recommended technology by Microsoft, primarily because it doesn't do SO very well. And honestly, the WCF counterpart (NetDataContractSerializer) gets sneered at by a lot of 'softies too - again, because it is the non-SO part of WCF. But the important thing to realize is that the NDCS <i>is </i>part of WCF, and there is a contingent within the Connected Systems team at Microsoft who still think there's a role for client/server in the world of the future.<br><br>I specifically rearchitected the data portal in CSLA .NET 2.0 to accomodate other protocols beyond Remoting. Partially to get at the much faster EnterpriseServices option, but mostly to pave the way for WCF.<br><br>As has been noted, you can download a preliminary version of a <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?area=11&amp;id=0eec56bb-2a61-47c4-a9ca-f98371db1cad">WCF data portal channel</a> from my web site. In general, it is a drop-in addition to the three existing channels - though you <i>can not </i>use the new DataContract concept as yet.<br><br>A future version of CSLA .NET (2.2 or 3.0 or something - I haven't decided) will provide full support for WCF, including the DataContract concept. That's a slightly bigger deal, because it means globally switching from the BinaryFormatter to the NDCS, because the BinaryFormatter doesn't support DataContract.<br><br>(which, btw, I find a bit odd, because WF uses the BinaryFormatter, so presumably there'll be issues saving workflows that use DataContract-style objects...)<br><br>So I rambled a bit here.<br><br>In summary: heavy use of Remoting should be avoided - specifically any alteration of Remoting with custom channels, formatters, etc. CSLA .NET uses Remoting in a pluggable, replacable manner and is largely immune to the "horror stories" people tell about Remoting.<br><br>I have a preliminary WCF data portal channel, and I am working with the Connected Systems team at Microsoft to ensure that there's a smooth transition to a future version of CSLA .NET that fully supports WCF, including the DataContract concept.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Sunday, September 10, 2006</h2><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the worst things about .NET 3.0 is the compatiblity, from what I understand it will support Windows XP SP2 and up.&nbsp; Whereas, the current 2.0 supports 98 SE and up.&nbsp; While this isn't that important to most of us, I do think it is pretty awesome that my clickonce application with integrated sql server reports works just as well on Windows 98 as it does on XP (I actually tested it and nearly crappy my pants when ClickOnce actually worked and deployed the framework, the report viewer and my application on Windows 98, the only real pre-requisite was IE6).</P>

<P>I can pay $10/$20 for an e-book detailing changes from 2.0 to 2.1, essentially having a 2.0 book that is "pretty close" to what the live framework is but with a supplementary read of the e-book necessary to really have the full picture. </P>
<P>Or, I can pay $50 for a book that has the entirety of the content of the CSLA framework up to date (at that point :))&nbsp;in one instructional flow. A relatively fast read for someone like me who has read the CSLA 1.x book and skimmed the 2.x book but more importantly a <STRONG>comprehensive</STRONG> read for other programmers at my location who may be coming to CSLA anew.&nbsp;When I need to reference back myself, I don't have two sources (the book and e-book)&nbsp;to reconcile, I only have one. </P>
<P>I'm sure a lot of people here would prefer the e-book, but I'd have to say I'd gladly shelve out $50 for another book for the "single-source" reference that an updated book would provide. </P>
<P>My two cents! </P>

<div align="left"><span class="280500021-11092006"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">Apress owns publication rights to the existing books, and 
rightly so. But as a result, I can't just take that exact content as-is and 
republish it - even with the alterations for version 2.1.</font></span></div>

covering version 2.1. While this content is of less value without the 
pre-existing book, it is a seperate work and thus avoids copyright 
issues.</font></span></div>

<blockquote>For 
  the version 2.1 ebook, are you planning to release just a chapter or integrate 
  it into the 2.0 book?&nbsp; I know that I would really like (and would 
  immediately purchase) an ebook that integrated all of the 2.1 changes and all 
  of the errata, but I will certainly purchase the ebook regardless to support 
  the work and experience that you have poured into 
CSLA.<br></blockquote></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br>Fair enough.&nbsp; I forgot that you were going to do the addendum apart from Apress.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
