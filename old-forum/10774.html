<p>There seems little point in going with a wpf interface at this point given the future direction of windows etc.</p>
<p>My question: with the old winform app it was easy to have a single stand alone install of our app for single computers not on a network.</p>
<p>Now ideally I&#39;d like to have users be able to run the new Silverlight version on one computer completely self contained. &nbsp;Without IIS.</p>
<p>Is this in any way possible / practical?</p>
<p>What should I look into to learn about doing this if it is?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>Curelom replied on Friday, October 14, 2011</h2><p>Not possible with Silverlight.&nbsp; It&#39;s very structure depends on a server on the backend.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are concerned about migrated it to a metro app in the future, you can still use WPF if you are disciplined in the GUI you use.&nbsp; The migration would likely be a little harder than migrating a Silverlight app.&nbsp; Perhaps a bigger difference in migrating would be whether you are using MVVM or not.&nbsp; If you use MVVM, then the migration will likely be changes to the XAML and not the underlying code.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Sunday, October 16, 2011</h2><p>Thanks guys, I took a long think about this and came to the conclusion that we really only need two UI&#39;s: WPF for windows (MVVM) and HTML 5 for all browsers and devices.</p>
<p>Cheers and thanks for giving me a sounding board.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>StefanCop replied on Friday, October 14, 2011</h2><p>Yes, you need a server process, but not necessarily IIS. </p>
<p>For example a self-hosting (ServiceHost) windows service, or a console app (which someone has to start first). I&#39;m not very familiar with security, but if it&#39;s all localhost this shouldn&#39;t be a problem. </p>
