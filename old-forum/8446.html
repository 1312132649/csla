<P>Special thanks to Jonny Bekkum for all his hard work, I think he checked in more changes than I did for this preview release :)</P>
<P>Please read the change log to see a list of the major changes included in this preview release.</P>
<P>The changes are numerous and touch many aspects of the framework. Most are not breaking changes (as compared to preview 1) - but obviously all the preview 1 breaking changes are still there if you are coming straight from 3.8.</P>
<P>So far the focus has been on "low hanging fruit" and cleanup. Doing a lot of changes that have been waiting for a major point release. None of the major refactoring is in this preview - hopefully some of those will be in the next preview (candidates include data portal refactoring, new business rule subsystem and authorization enhancements).</P>
<P>The only "known issue" in this preview 2, is that the ASP.NET MVC API is in flux. Depending on which particular prerelease of MVC 2 you have installed, you might need to tweak the code in CslaModelBinder to build the Csla.Web.Mvc project. Both valid lines of code are there - just comment/uncomment to get the right one - you'll see what I mean if you get a compiler error when building :)</P>
<P>I suspect (hope) that the next preview will target the VS10 release candidate, but that depends on when/if the RC comes out, and when we're ready for the next CSLA preview release.</P>
<P>Please download the preview, use it and let us know if you encounter any issues. Thanks!</P>
