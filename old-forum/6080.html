<P>The big change is that the LoadProperty&lt;P,F&gt;() overloads are now renamed to LoadPropertyConvert&lt;P,F&gt;() to eliminate ambiguity.</P>
<P>This means you can do:</P>
<P>LoadProperty(NameProperty, "Fred")</P>
<P>and the compiler will resolve the type parameters for you. But you still need to provide the type parameters for LoadPropertyConvert().</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lukky replied on Monday, January 05, 2009</h2>Thanks Rocky,<br><br>This is what I get when I work late on a Sunday night...<br><br>After posting, I found the change in the changelog for 3.6, but the delay for post deletion had expired <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /><br><br>I have modified the CSLAContrib CodeSmith templates to reflect that change.<br><br>On a related note, do you happen to know if Rick Supit is still actively working on those templates ? I'd be glad to give him a hand, but I've tried to e-mail him with no success.<br><br>Regards.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
