I&#39;ve tried a number of things to address this, and I _think_ I finally have some sort of solution.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve set the forum so all new users are moderated, so any posts they make won&#39;t appear without approval. This is a serious pain for new users, but it also means spammers can&#39;t just join and post.</p>
<p>The software the spammers are using is pretty sophisticated though, and it has apparently been creating fake users for a long time, then days or weeks later the software returns and uses those accounts to post spam. As that happens I&#39;m banning those users.</p>
<p>Eventually all the spambot-created fake users will be banned, and all new users will be moderated, so the spam should diminish quite a bit.</p>
<p>If you ARE a new user, and are a real person, just make a real post (real question, or real answer to a question) and as I moderate the posts and see something valid I&#39;ll mark your user as not moderated.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps the spam problem.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Wednesday, March 05, 2014</h2><p>Doesn&#39;t seem to be working so well</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 05, 2014</h2><p>No kidding...</p>
<p>The moderation feature of this software must not work, or at least not work as one would expect.</p>
<p>I might have to get some other (more modern) forum software and start over :(</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 05, 2014</h2><p>I&#39;ve tweaked some of the spam rules for posts - maybe that&#39;ll help some.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, March 05, 2014</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b>
<p>I&#39;ve tweaked some of the spam rules for posts - maybe that&#39;ll help some.</p>

<p>I was emailed about posts awaiting moderation.&nbsp; all but one was spam so I deleted.&nbsp; one was from a user that&#39;s been here a few months at least.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 05, 2014</h2><p>Thank you Andy.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you need to delete the spam posts, they&#39;ll automatically be deleted after a few days if they aren&#39;t approved.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, March 06, 2014</h2><p>Oh ok, didn&#39;t know.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
