<P>I've added an override to CanWriteProperty in my CustomBusinessBase class, but while that works I don't get the advantage of the cache in the Csla.Core.BusinessBase class.&nbsp; I don't really want to have another cache in my class.</P>
<P>Has Rocky ever addressed this?&nbsp; This seems like such a powerful feature it would have been added by now.&nbsp; Or was the thought that&nbsp;BusinessBase objects don't usually have a lot of read only properties and the extra reflection call on the first permission check would be a (usually) wasted performance hit?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Monday, December 18, 2006</h2><P>One more thing.&nbsp; The extender component allows you to add a property to the object to which it applies.&nbsp; In this case it adds the ApplyAuthorization property to controls in the forms designer.</P>
<P>But from what I can see this new property is going to default to the default for the type, which is false for a boolean.&nbsp; How do I make the default true?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, December 21, 2006</h2>I think you'd have to modify the component, because it defines what the default value should be.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
