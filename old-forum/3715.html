<P>Each time I think that I have translated from the data centric world to the OO world, I found my self lost...</P>
<P>When I begin creating my business object,&nbsp;I always say : "there is no database, there is no database...", but simply&nbsp;I can't !</P>
<P>I don't know who must be created first ? who must lead the creating of the other ?</P>
<P>I know that in a specific time, I will deal with SQL statements in my business objects, I know that my properties will be bounded to columns in the database (or simply not ?), what about persisting calculated columns (for performance reasons) ?...</P>
<P>I hope that someone will share his idea with me, this is a general discussion...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, October 15, 2007</h2>Here's what I've found helpful.&nbsp; I create use cases, based on what my customers / users say they need the application to do.&nbsp; I create the business objects to focus on acomplishing that task.&nbsp; Don't think about the database at this point, its not necessary.&nbsp; Making the process more formal, by creating class diagrams and such has helped me.&nbsp; Once you think you have a good object model, try writing some unit tests to see how your users would interact with the objects (basically, what calls the UI would make on behalf of the user).&nbsp; <br><br>After all the is done, then you can start thinking about how to actually store the data.&nbsp; Don't change your BOs for any reason while you're doing the design of the database.&nbsp; It is hard, but you need to keep at it to retrain your brain.&nbsp; Reading Rocky's chapter on building an actual business layer on Csla is a good thing to do once in a while too.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
