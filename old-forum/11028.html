<p>I know you&#39;re a very busy man, and I wouldn&#39;t want this post to come across as being rude or lacking respect towards your great contribution to the .NET world, but I think I&#39;m entitled to ask you if you&#39;re ever going to finish the <i>Using CSLA 4 eBooks series</i>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been almost a year now since I purchased the whole series, and when I go to the download page, I see that most of them are still tagged as draft.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t help wondering, because I follow you on different social networks and I see you&#39;re involved with a gazillion projects (Windows phone, Mono etc...), and I almost feel like you&#39;ve put the eBooks project aside to concentrate on those other projects.</p>
<p>Could you give us a status on the eBooks series ?</p>
<p>Thank you</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 02, 2012</h2><p>No disrespect taken.</p>
<p>For most of the books the issue is one of terminology. &quot;Draft&quot; means the books are going through a copyedit process to clean up language and fix misspellings. The <em>content</em> of books 1-6 are complete, and won&#39;t change other than to address errata.</p>
<p>Maybe I should use &quot;in final edit&quot; instead of &quot;draft&quot; for those books to be more clear.</p>
<p>The final edit process is taking longer than I&#39;d expected. This is due to some health issues with my editor. In future book projects I&#39;ll probably entirely skip this final copyedit process. Other colleagues of mine that do self-publishing don&#39;t take that step at all and think I&#39;m crazy for doing it in the first place. I personally like the copy edit step, because I think the final product is more polished by having a copyeditor fix English language errors, but this project has revealed the challenges involved in that step :(</p>
<p>Book 7 (the Windows Phone book) really has taken a lot longer than I anticipated. This is mostly because I&#39;ve struggled to find what I believe is a good way to structure a WP7 app, and because &quot;Mango&quot; completely undid what I thought was a good approach. In other words, we are all fortunate that I didn&#39;t finish the book before 7.5, because the techniques I was using stopped working in 7.5...</p>
<p>Over the holiday break I have been picking away at the new approach, and I think I have a good approach now. I&#39;ll be giving it a good try through the next week, and if it all pans out as I hope, I should be able to finish book 7 by the end of January.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Books 1-2 are done</li>
<li>Books 3-6 are in &quot;final copy edit&quot; to clean up language, but content is complete</li>
<li>Book 7 should be in &quot;final copy edit&quot; by the end of January</li>
</ol>
