<P><STRONG>For Silverlight users</STRONG></P>
<P>The only real change from 3.6.3 is that the Silverlight framework and unit test projects now build using Silverlight 3 in Visual Studio 2008.</P>
<P>Over the next few weeks there'll be more changes on the Silverlight side, as I change the UI controls to use element binding, etc.</P>
<P><STRONG>For Windows/.NET users</STRONG></P>
<P>On the .NET/Windows side of things, 3.7 shouldn't change other than bug fixes. In other words, if you are using 3.6.x, then 3.7 will be the natural upgrade to get any bug fixes - at least this is my current plan. </P>

It's only possible with stupid javacript hacking in windowless mode etc. Anyway <br /><br />lots of discussion about it on the following link:<br />http://silverlight.net/forums/t/81334.aspx<br /><br />I'm with Montago hehe<br />That bartczernicki guy does like limitations haha</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
