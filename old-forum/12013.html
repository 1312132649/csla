<p>I have a viewmodel set up which is of type object1. Object1 has some properties,&nbsp;one of which is another object(object2) of type BusinessListBase. Currently when I submit my form using defaultModelBinder, object2 always has count = 0.</p>
<p>Is the only way to bind the list to use FormCollection as below from the using csla ebook:</p>
<p>public ActionResult EditList(FormCollection collection) { var list = RoleEditList.GetRoles(); UpdateModel(list, collection); SaveObject(list, false); return View(); } </p>
<p>If so, how does UpdateModel map the keys to the listitems, as the key does not exactly match, and it doesn&#39;t seem to do anything in my code?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
