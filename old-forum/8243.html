I could find a way to read this values in object. <br /><br />How can I read validation rules collection? and How can I access to the regular ex and max length values within this collection?<br /><br /><br />Note: Since I don't have time, I'm adding public RegularExpressionCollection and MaxLenthCollection to my class and adding values to this collections while adding validation rules. And I will use this collections but I think this is not a good solution since this information is already available in validation rules which I couldn't find a way to read it.<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Friday, January 01, 2010</h2><br />Not sure if this is what you are asking but one way that I know to get information about your business rules is to do something like this:<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />string[] ruleDescriptions = ValidationRules.GetRuleDescriptions();<br />foreach (string rds in ruleDescriptions)<br />{<br />    Csla.Validation.RuleDescription rdo = new Csla.Validation.RuleDescription(rds);<br />    foreach (var kvp in rdo.Arguments)<br />    {<br />        Console.WriteLine(kvp.Key + "=" + kvp.Value);<br />    }<br />}<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>galford replied on Tuesday, January 05, 2010</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>rxelizondo:</strong></div><div>Not sure if this is what you are asking but one way that I know to get information about your business rules is to do something like this:<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />string[] ruleDescriptions = ValidationRules.GetRuleDescriptions();<br />foreach (string rds in ruleDescriptions)<br />{<br />    Csla.Validation.RuleDescription rdo = new Csla.Validation.RuleDescription(rds);<br />    foreach (var kvp in rdo.Arguments)<br />    {<br />        Console.WriteLine(kvp.Key + "=" + kvp.Value);<br />    }<br />}<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------</div></BLOCKQUOTE><br /><br />This code just work fine, and I could use validation rules to set editor properties.

I'm not at work at moment but will post it within the next 24 hours. You give it a binding source and it does the rest for you. <br /><br />You could then adjust it to work with your specific controls in needed. It has been a great way to limit mistakes in the UI.<br /><br />Marjon</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Sunday, January 03, 2010</h2>Please find attached the VB project that has the extender provider to automatically set the MaxLength property on any Textbox that is bound to a property that has the StringLengthAttribute.<br /><br />Hopefully you find this useful, the original was specifically tied to our DevExpress controls and had additional code to set their MaxLength properties as well, so can be modified to meet your controls.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>galford replied on Monday, January 04, 2010</h2>Thanks for help. I will work on it. <br />I'm also using devexpress controls, I'm gonna convert your code to C# first,<br />then modify it for devexpress controls.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
