<P>It seems as though this is an incorrect statement, when you call clear on the collection it does remove all of the objects from the collection but since I do not see where the CSLA frame work overrides the clear method it does not move items to the deleted list. </P>
<P>If you test this by adding an item then&nbsp;calling clear and then call update nothing is deleted. And the collection does not contain any objects to be updated.</P>
<P>This is just my observation while learning to use this framework. (at least in version 2.0.2)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
