<p class="MsoNormal">I am fairly new to CSLA.&nbsp;I have a question about what
to do after a save method has been applied to a class.<span>&nbsp; </span>Specifically, I have a class that represents
an appointment object.<span>&nbsp; </span>After the
appointment has been saved and stored in the database I am unsure as to what
the pattern is for the next step:<o:p> <br></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Should
the class be re-initialized so that the next appointment can be created?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Should
the members of the class that make up the appointment be re-initialized with
out creating a new instance of the class?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Am
I missing the pattern completely and the process is different then what I have
described above.</p>Thanks,<br>Scott<br><br><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, December 10, 2007</h2>What happens in your use case?&nbsp; Usually in my cases the form is rebound to the form so that the user can continue to edit the object.&nbsp; They can choose to close the window if they want.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
