<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm finally starting to work on my project, after finishing a client project. :)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyway, if I'm going to use CSLA .NET, I want it to be used for all data access, including for membership, roles, profiles, etc etc etc.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Obviously I really don't want to have to write all these providers manually and would love just to wrap the existing functionality.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So my question is, is there a fairly painless way of wrapping these providers so that they execute in the remote environment instead of the local, but otherwise use all of their existing functionality?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Any help is much appreciated.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
