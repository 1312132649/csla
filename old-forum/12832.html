<p> &nbsp;My idea was to use second command for periodically observing progress of first command (running in new thread) as a benefit I get option get status information and result once is finnished. But unfortunately I can&#39;t get it working without getting it too much complex. Any ideas or anything in CSLA which will help me with this?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider this a workaround; you have an operation that takes longer than the default timeout, so increasing the timeout is the right way to go.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Your only alternative is to have your command BO somehow initiative an asynchronous process.&nbsp; For example a Windows service which will pickup on a request logged to your DB and then execute the actual work.&nbsp; Your data portal request will of course return very quickly, but the work the user has asked to do won&#39;t be completed, so you&#39;ll need to figure out how to handle that as well.</p>
<p>Putting the work on a background thread running under Asp.net would be a bad idea.&nbsp; Obviously this is quite a bit more work than just increasing the timeout via the config file.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
