As an intial step to getting this together I did a compile of CSLACS and get an error 75 "AL.exe" was not found. Says it is looking for HKey_Localmachine...\v6.04. I have that key but with no refrence to AL.exe, I do have another key ending in V6.1 that does have a refrence to AL.exe. I double checked and I have all the other things installed Server 2008 SDK, Framework 3.5, etc. How do I fix this?</P>

<P>AL.EXE is the assembly linker, and it is a standard part of a .NET developer install. If your VS installation can't find AL.EXE, you probably have a messed up VS install, and you should consider doing a repair or reinstall.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mick_G replied on Wednesday, July 29, 2009</h2>Thanks Rocky, I as is typical thought the problem must be in something in my recent download not the other things I had done recently!! Sheez. </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
