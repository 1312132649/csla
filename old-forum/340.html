<P>(1) You should certainly consider implementing the IDisposable interface on your BO.&nbsp; That way you have the ability to call the Dispose() method on your BO when required to free the resources used.</P>
<P>(2) Are you actually using a "remote data portal"?&nbsp; If the answer to this question is yes, then I believe you should follow Rocky's advice.&nbsp; However, it is quite possible that you are not using the fully remote Data Portal concept, so don't worry.</P>
<P>However, if you are using true remoting and have large image fields in your BO then&nbsp;are you really sure you want all that data being serialised and moved around the network?&nbsp; Is there another way to achieve the same overall result by passing the URL/URI to the image instead?&nbsp; Just a thought.</P>
