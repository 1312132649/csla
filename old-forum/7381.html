Use "cascading delete" constraint in your DB. No need to worry about this in your BO.<br><br>2. Use a SP in database that handles deleting parent and children<br><br>3. Programatically handle the delete operation to make sure to delete all children before deleting parent.&nbsp; <br><br>I would prefer either 1 or 2 - You should not have to rely on loading your domainmodel (parent and possibly a lot of children) into memory to be sure to delete all children in DB. <br><br>/jonnybee<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
