For example, if last/sur/family name has a maximum length of 64, how would the UI know to set it's textbox.MaxLength property to 64; I don't what to hard code 64 in the UI. </P>
<P>Thanks for any help!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 25, 2009</h2><P>You can ask the object for its rules, and you'll get back a collection of rule:// URI's. You can then use the Csla.Validation.RuleDescription class to parse those URI's to get at the rule name, property name, parameters, etc.</P>
<P>The method to get the list of rules is on the ValidationRules object, and is accessible inside your business object:</P>
<P>var rules = ValidationRules.GetRuleDescriptions();</P>
<P>To make this available to the UI you'll need to put a public method on your business object.</P>
<P>If you have a custom base class between BusinessBase&lt;T&gt; and your business objects (which I recommend), then you can add this method to your base class, and all your business objects will then expose the value.</P>
