Since I want reuse the Order object which subclass from BusinessBase and contains child collection of OrderItems, I have a  reference attribtue in DO to Order.<br />Question: Should I mark the Order as child when I populated it? How can I make it as readonly since DO cannot alter Order? Can I turn off the Undoable and Serializable to Order only to improve the performance?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Monday, August 17, 2009</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I think you're going to be better off not re-using your Order object.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>CSLA objects are designed around use cases, and it sounds like you have different use cases for&nbsp;your "order".&nbsp; Trying to re-use an editable object in a read-only scenario - not to mention the parent-and-child&nbsp;switch - is very likely to cause you many headaches for little value.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Re-use is not an overarching goal, and is really only useful where the situations are exactly the same.&nbsp; It's not uncommon at all for there to be multiple versions of the same data in different objects, because the objects do different things.&nbsp; That's not to say that you can't refactor the common functionality into a common module, but ultimately in your situation I'd create two different objects - one an editable object (which subclasses BusinessBase), the other a read-only object (which subclasses ReadOnlyBase).&nbsp; You'll get the child functionality on your read-only object&nbsp;if you use the child&nbsp;methods of the DataPortal when interacting with your read-only object; otherwise you'll need to call "MarkAsChild" manually.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>(To answer your final question, you can't really "turn off" the undoable/serializable&nbsp;functionality on a CSLA object.&nbsp; Nor do you really need to, as they shouldn't cause you any performance issues if you don't use them.)</FONT></P>
