<P>I am trying to use codesmith to generate an 'EditableRoot' or any 'Root' class based on a stored proc.and i keep getting this error. I have downloaded the new 9.5 codetemplate files and i am using a trial version of codesmith.</P>
<P>this is a proc that is currently being used and works fine outside of codesmith. Also, there is a primary key set in the database. I even changed the key to&nbsp; 'uniqueidentifier' in the hopes that it would work, but no luck. I have also tried adding all the columns returned in the proc within the "uniqueColumnNames' filed.</P>
<P>I have recreated the PTracker datascheme and i do not get this error when running against those Procs.</P>
<P>Anyone have any idea's????</P>

<P>1. Must use retrieve/get stored proc which usually return 1 or more result sets.</P>
<P>2. Specify the pk in UniqueColumnNames, since the template does not know which columns in the result set is the pk column.</P>
<P>Please see other post from Tom Cooley regarding the use of sp as data source:</P>

<P>I had the primary key set and tried using that in the UniqueColumnNames but still got the same error.</P>
<P>I rewrote the existing Proc and it now works just fine. go figure ( though this datascheme is not very good. Have to love legacey stuff)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>decius replied on Wednesday, October 29, 2008</h2><P>I've got this same problem and have been digging for an answer for a while now.&nbsp; I have assigned a primary key and still get the following error with the templates, but only on the EditableRoot.cst!
