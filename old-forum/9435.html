<p>I have read all the posts in the forum about CSLA and MVC and understand that they <i>do</i> work together, and (think) I understand how the CSLA business objects are used as the M in MVC, but i was wondering if there was any kind of primer for using CSLA with MVC; best practices, examples, stuff for real idiots :)</p>
<p>Preferrably material that relates to CSLA4, .NET4, MVC2.</p>
<p>Many Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, August 26, 2010</h2><p>Gary has a demo showing the CSLA 4 features being used with ASP.NET MVC 2. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s had time to add that to the samples folder yet, but you should look for it to probably come with 4.0.2 - so in the next few weeks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lee_b replied on Thursday, August 26, 2010</h2><p>Fantastic!
