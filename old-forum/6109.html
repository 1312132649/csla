<P><FONT face=Arial>To outline my problem, here is an example:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Form1 is opened with Object1.&nbsp; Object1 is of type A.&nbsp; Object1 is populated with data for Person1.&nbsp;&nbsp;No changes are made to Object1.&nbsp; This instance of Form1 is left open.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Another instance of Form1 is opened with Object2.&nbsp; Object2 is also of type A.&nbsp; Object2 is populated with data for Person2.&nbsp; Changes are made to Object2.&nbsp; Object2 is saved and this instance of Form1 is closed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Back to the original instance of Form1 with Object1.&nbsp; Object1 is now dirty, although no changes have happened to it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>So, you can see the problem I am having.&nbsp; I am leaning towards it being a threading problem, but I am not sure.&nbsp; Can anyone provide some advice?</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, January 09, 2009</h2>Sounds like something in your code is using a static variable when it shouldn't be.&nbsp; <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>honus replied on Friday, January 09, 2009</h2><P>Could you provide a little bit more information?&nbsp; I have scoured my entire solution, and I cannot find any 'static' declaration.&nbsp; However, I do have ReadOnly properties in my object, and I read somewhere that ReadOnly properties are used as static.&nbsp; Is this the problem?</P>
<P>I am really confused what static properties would have anything to do with the problem I am experiencing.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>honus replied on Friday, January 09, 2009</h2>Actually, I found that I declared a Shared instance of my object in the form, and I am guessing that is the problem.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, January 09, 2009</h2>Sorry, I assumed you were using C#... but it seems you're using VB.&nbsp; Yes, a Shared variable in VB would be a problem.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>honus replied on Friday, January 09, 2009</h2><P>No problem, your post actually got me thinking in the right direction, so thanks!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
