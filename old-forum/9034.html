Rocky</p>
<p>What&#39;s the any real practical scenario, where we need to <em>pass</em> <strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">mobile objects</span></em></strong> as a <em>reference</em> type as a parameter to other methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Object instances are always passed by reference in .NET, end of story. Given that, there are countless practical scenarios where you &quot;pass an object&quot; as a parameter to a method <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p>
<p>But I suspect that&#39;s not the intent of your question. Unfortunately I can&#39;t figure out what you are asking, can you please clarify?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Harmanjeet replied on Sunday, June 06, 2010</h2><p>Hi! Rocky</p>
<p>I asked the above Question in the context of Mobile Object. Were, do we need them to pass as reference instead of Value, in real pratical scenario.</p>
<p>not the generic concept of Pass by Value/Reference.</p>

Objects are copied or cloned across the network, so you always end up with a different instance of the object on the other machine. Read chapter 1 of the Expert Business Objects book for information on this.</p>
<p>Some technologies, like .NET Remoting, simulate passing objects over the network by reference. That is really not &quot;by reference&quot; - they are simulating the concept. CSLA has never used or supported that concept, which is good because that idea doesn&#39;t work in web services or (without some effort) WCF.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Harmanjeet replied on Monday, June 07, 2010</h2><p>Hi!</p>
