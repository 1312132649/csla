<P>So when you say the "app crashes" you mean the browser crashes? IIS crashes?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>memocr replied on Monday, February 26, 2007</h2>web.... <br>and yeah the browser....<br><br><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<P>If that's so - then it appears to be an actual issue getting IE to post back the page, and I've got no idea on that. Try Firefox and see if it has the same issue?</P>
<P>The problem with IE7, in particular, is that it is intentionally obscure about the actual nature of any problem that is encountered...</P>
<P>Another thing you can/should do, is turn on more verbose error reporting in your web.config, so if it is a server-side issue (and it most likely is) that you get some more detailed and useful feedback.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>memocr replied on Monday, February 26, 2007</h2>yeah i have a break on the page_load and on the selectedindexchanged.<br><br>well, i didn't try firefox before, but i have now&nbsp; and it actually worked. so, it must be an IE7 issue with CSLA? jjumm.. because as i said before...i don't have the problem when i bind the gridview with a dataset...<br><br>haven't someone else have this issue, because it is very common to bind ur gridview with a csla object....<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 26, 2007</h2>






 





<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If it is a browser issue, then it isn&#8217;t CSLA &#8211; it is
something to do with the javascript being emitted by the ASP.NET page. CSLA
doesn&#8217;t emit anything to the UI at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>In other words, there&#8217;s some difference in how the grid is
configured or your page is configured between your two test pages. The issue
may be that in one page you are using data binding and not in the other, or
something like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I, and many, many, other people use the GridView control with
CSLA </span><span>J</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
