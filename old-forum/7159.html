<P><SPAN>According to the roadmap CSLA is supposed to support VS2010/NET4.0&nbsp;not before 2010. We would like to start porting our application on&nbsp;VS2010 as soon as possible (mainly because of the promised new WPF features like charts etc.&nbsp;and possible performance improvements). Is there any chance to get access to a CSLA preview for VS2010Beta1/.NET4.0 before 2010?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P>As always, while I'm working on it, the code will be in svn - you can always grab the working folder from the repository. My development process is about as transparent as I can make it.</P>
<P>At the moment though, Silverlight 3 is the priority, since it will be out many months before .NET 4.0.</P>
<P>But before I get to SL3 I need to finish a different project I'm working on, that is tangential to CSLA. Hopefully that'll be done in the next 1-2 weeks so I can dig into Silverlight 3.</P>
<P>fwiw, I did blog about the steps required to build 3.6.x in VS 2010&nbsp;- it appears that the VS upgrade wizard has some bugs, so hand-editing of some project files is required before they can be opened.</P>

So I only wanted to know if you (or any on else outside, who is reading this post) made any progress and what to expect midterm. I fully agree to push Silverlight 3 effort. So I will go ahead and give it a try on VS2010.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 24, 2009</h2>The problem with creating a branch for VS10 is that I have to merge the<br />branch back into trunk later. I did this with 3.6 last summer and it was a<br />pain, because 3.5 had changed, and 3.6 had a lot of changes, and the merge<br />process was painful.<br /><br />Right now I could have three active branches - 3.6.x, 3.7.x and 4.0.x. I<br />shudder to think what it would mean to merge 3.6 and 3.7 into 4.0 over time.<br /><br />So I'm trying to minimize the number of active branches by putting off any<br />work on VS10 until the SL3 work is done and 3.7 actually exists.<br /><br />Then I can put 3.6 and 3.7 into bug-fix-only mode while I work on 4.0.<br /><br />Rocky<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: Andreas [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 2:57 PM<br />To: rocky@lhotka.net<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] CSLA for VS2010<br /><br />I was reading your blog entry and was wondering if you are still working on<br />a port.
