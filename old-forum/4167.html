<P class=MsoNormal>I would like to use CSLA.NET version that works with Visual Studio.NET 2005 to create the following application.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Questions about creating an ‘executable’ that will not remained installed once a user enters some data into the application. I also want this applcation to not require any previous software installed on a users workstation.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>I basically want<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>to setup an application for new users when they are applying for insurance.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>This application would preferably be a run as a windows desktop application versus on the internet. Once the user enters the save or submit button, I want the application to send the data back to be processed on a Sql server 2000 or sql server 2005 database.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Let me know what general suggestions that you would have.</P>

<P>The only way to get a smart client application that doesn't require any previous software on the client (other than Windows itself) is probably to use C++. Or maybe VB6, because the VB runtime is a standard part of all current versions of Windows.</P>
<P>If you are willing to pre-suppose .NET, then you can use .NET programs, and CSLA .NET.</P>
<P>The simplest way to get the kind of deployment you want is to use ClickOnce. You can use ClickOnce in a mode where the app can only be launched through a URL. Technically the app isn't "uninstalled" after use, but from the user's perspective it is gone. In reality it is still in a cache - not entirely unlike web apps (they aren't uninstalled either unless the user flushes their browser cache).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
