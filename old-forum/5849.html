<P>A couple of&nbsp; years ago I wrote a plug-in for LLBLGen Pro that would generate CSLA.NET Business Object classes from LLBLGen entities using the LLBLGen code generator. This is described in this post:</P>

<P>I have the opportunity to update the tool to support the latest CSLA release and also the latest LLBLGen. I'm trying to assess the potential for this. Would many people use it? The templates are for C# only - mainly because that's my language of choice, and use the LLBLGen self-servicing data access model. But, there are hook points in the generated code (using partial classes) that allow the data access to be modified (pre-fetched, filtered, etc.) at strategic points.</P>
<P>Anyway, I'd be interested in opinions on this.</P>
<P>Thanks for your time.</P>
<P>Cheers...</P>
