<P>When I run, I get an error on the page "DataBinding:&nbsp; LynxLibrary.SFList does not contain a property with the name 'Label'".&nbsp; This occurs with the first property I try to get.&nbsp; I use &lt;%# Eval (SearchFields.Label %&gt; to bind the data in the GridView.&nbsp; SearchFields is the public property in Tnail that returns the SFList child object.&nbsp; I do get all of the properties on the BusinessBase class (Tnail).&nbsp; I thought the purpose of creating private members and public properties in the public structure of a ReadOnlyCollectionBase was to allow ASP.NET data binding.</P>
<P>Incidentally, if I create a tnail object in code (rather than through the ObjectDataSource), I can see all properties in the parent and child objects.</P>
<P>Any help would be very much appreciated.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Wednesday, November 21, 2007</h2><P>To do the data binding I think you are suggesting in ASP.NET you need to use a CslaDataSource instead of an ObjectDataSource.</P>
<P>Have you tried that?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Walt replied on Thursday, November 22, 2007</h2><P>Thanks David,</P>
<P>I haven't tried a CslaDataSource.&nbsp; I will look that up and see how to implement it.&nbsp; Until now I have been using CSLA 1.x, and haven't come accross CslaDataSource.&nbsp; I have tried binding to a business object that inherits BusinessBase, but that didn't work.&nbsp; This is my first venture in ASP.NET, so I'm sure I'm missing something important.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Sunday, November 25, 2007</h2><P>The ObjectDataSource has some very strict requirements which are NOT friendly to CSLA.</P>
<P>I believe the Public Sub New is the biggest issue.</P>
<P>The CslaDataSource obviously takes these things into account and is better for handling these issues.</P>
<P>That said, I do not use it. I have not found a need to do so yet. I do have 2-way binding controls though. I use some code provided by Rick Strahl.</P>
