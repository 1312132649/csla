<P>Windows Forms 2.0 has the TextBox.AutoCompleteXXX members. I'd like to use a bo of some sort to fetch data and use as the AutoCompleteCustomSource. I can't figure out how to do that, so I'm thinking I might make something along the lines of NameValueList - or maybe have a ReadOnlyList expose a StringCollection? I'm not sure and would hate to store the data twice.</P>
<P>Anyway, anyone come across needing to do this? Just fishing for thoughts.</P>
<P>Right now I have a ReadOnlyList whose child has a single property. Then I loop through that assigning the strings to an array. Then use StringCollection.AddRange(). So I have the data in two places, which I guess would be a good thing to avoid.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
