( it gets called several times and the last time it gets called you can't access the databounditem since the item has been removed from the list.<br>then i tried to use AcceptChangesComplete again in the hope that i would be able to catch an exception which is thrown in the csla layer and relay the exception to the controller layer to handle it. sadly that wasn't the case.<br>does anyone have a appropriate practice since I'm not able to got anyhow in between the datagridviews and the editableroots endedit.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bayu replied on Tuesday, October 31, 2006</h2>Maybe it's a solution to make use of a BindingSource object. The datasource of this bindingsource is your BO, and you set the DataViews datasource to this bindingsource.<br><br>The thing is that the BindingSource throws several interesting events, among which the ListChanged Event. The ListChangedEventArgs that are supplied with it contains a property ListChangeType, you can base your logic on the value of this enumerated type.<br><br>Bayu<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
