This is what I would like to&nbsp;do. Take for example a simple parent child (Invoice, InvoiceItems) example. Would like to use one Invoice form where at the top there will be different search criteria ie start end date, invoice number and so on. There will be also a command button called search. The user will&nbsp;enter search criteria&nbsp;and then click search.&nbsp;Let me design first the sceen to make it easier</P>

<P>Nav Grid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invoice Business object</P>

<P>&nbsp;I would like to take the search return business object(will only have few attributes InvoiceNum,Date,$) and attatch it a navigation datagridview(not updated by user but updated by the savecode). The user can click on any line on the nav grid and the text boxes of the Invoice and InvoiceItemsGrid will be refreshed by going to the db and getting an Invoice object and InvoiceItems&nbsp;business object based the invoice num&nbsp;on&nbsp;the selected&nbsp;invoice num coming from the nav grid. Would like when a user adds,updates or deletes anything, to have the navigation business objected to be&nbsp;updated and refreshed accordingly only on the screen. For example, if a user adds an invoice that invoice will also be added to the nav business object. If a user adds more items to the existing selected row, the nav grid would be updated to have the right amount.</P>
<P>Any ideas of how to implement the navigation business object? </P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>Thanks,</P>

again.&nbsp; Unless this is a list of tens of thousands of objects, you
will probably find the performance to be acceptable.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GeorgeG replied on Monday, January 08, 2007</h2><P>The data&nbsp;is not even in the thousand. I am thinking</P>
<OL>
<LI>Load the nav cursor again when the user calls the save code sucessfully in the win front end. </LI>
<LI>Not have the nav object altogether&nbsp;per se&nbsp;but have an editable not child BusinessListBase so the user can navigate and also update the text boxes attached to it.&nbsp;Certain columns will be attached to a datagridview and most of the&nbsp;the columns(ones to show to user) attached to text boxes. </LI></OL>
<P>The 1st one should be faster and lighter but need to worry about synchronization code(where the user was left) and may sorting. The latter will probably take longer&nbsp;for savecode to return if you have a lot of rows but less code. </P>
