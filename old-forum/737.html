You should already be placing your "save()" calls in a try, catch, you might want to log that to an event logger, or a special db where you log user user's bug reports, whatever. You will however, what to inform your user that something unexpected did happen and how it could affect them, so forth.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 26, 2006</h2><P>Make sure to differentiate between logging and auditing. The was a great thread on auditing a few weeks ago.</P>
<P>But if you want to do logging, I'd recommend pushing as much as you can into base classes. Business developers are often very bad at remembering to add logging code, but if it is in your framework it is hard to avoid <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
<P>What do you want to log? Data operations? Create a subclass of BusinessBase and override the DataPortal_OnInvoke and _OnComplete methods to record before/after data access info - stuff like that.</P>
<P>I personally like log4net. Many people like Microsoft's Enterprise Library. Yet others use the built in trace/log facility in .NET (especially in .NET 2.0, and even more especially in VB, because the My namespace wraps it very nicely). But log4net has been around and is very feature-rich, and I've found it to be quite good.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bonio replied on Thursday, July 27, 2006</h2><P>Hi Rocky</P>
<P>Primarily I am looking to log errors in a new application (most probably at data level). I will take a look at subclassing business base and see what I can achieve.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
