I am like the few others who have posted I need to handle changing between connection strings at login. I understand to use </font><font size="2">Csla.<font color="#2b91af">ApplicationContext</font>.ClientContext to store my connectionstring.<br><br>I basically changed the login control Layouttemplate to include a drop down and I have a my DSN's stored in the web config file. The form comes up and I can still log in with the one connection string but I want to use my drop down to build the connection string.<br><br>My problem is I can't get the dropdown selectedvalue to be passed to the membership provider since I want to set the ClientContext["dbname"] to equal the dropdown value and then I have a class that will build the connectionstring and be used throughout the objects.<br><br>Am I not allowed to use a layouttemplate or is there a better way to handle setting a Connectionstring if you have more than one connection?<br><br>Any tips or websites to study up on this subject will be appreciated. Have a wonderful day.<br></font><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>clsanewbie replied on Sunday, November 11, 2007</h2>Nevermind I got it working and I apologize to everyone for wasting your time.
