<P>I got the latest Csla and Csla SL (3.6.1) and built the libraries and ran the Rolodex example.&nbsp; Whenever I try to log on it comes back with invalid user.&nbsp; Now, I copied my prototype that I was developing under 3.6.0 over (which works under 3.6.0) and relinked the libraries to 3.6.1 and received the same error.&nbsp; I then copied the Rolodex example that was working in 3.6.0 over to the 3.6.1 directory and relinked the libraries and did a rebuild and loged on and it came back with Invalid user.</P>
<P>I am setting break points on the server side (by going into VS 2008, Debug, Attach to process, etc.) and none of my break points are being hit under the 3.6.1 version, but things work under the 3.6.0 version.</P>
<P>I am wondering if anyone else has had this problem before I dig too far into it and kill too much time.&nbsp; As of now, I can keep going with 3.6.0 and move forward, but I don't want to waste too much time trying to figure out what is going on with the 3.6.1 stuff.&nbsp; Anyway, anyone have any ideas?</P>

<P>I ran into exactly the same problem - there's a bug in the RolodexIdentity class in the sample in 3.6.1.</P>
<P>See this thread for the solution: <A HREF="/forums/thread/30862.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/30862.aspx</A></P>
<P>Cheers...</P>

<P>Thank you.&nbsp; It makes sense now as to why things didn't work when I copied the previous Rolodex over and linked w/the 3.6.1 stuff.&nbsp; Thought I was loosing my mind for a while there!</P>
<P>Thanks again,</P>
