happily found the CSLA Gen project.&nbsp; I have been using CodeSmith for my code
generation up till now but am interested in potentially switching to
CSLA Gen (I like the idea of being in control of the generator).&nbsp; Can
anyone provide some feedback on whether this is a good idea?&nbsp; How long does it take to get up to speed with CSLAGen and is it developed enough that making the switch is a good idea?<br><br>All comments are greatly appreciated.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Elliot Slater<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DesNolan replied on Tuesday, September 04, 2007</h2>Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't CSLA Gen use the CodeSmith
generation engine, and thus extends that application. Is that engine
redistributable?<br>
<br>
(I just completed a cursory review of the four most popular generators
for CSLA and wrote up some rough notes as to my views of them for some
developers working for me,
I'd be happy to send it to anyone, its in MS Word doc format. Be
warned, it's not likely to be everyone's cup of tea, but may be of use
for a general overview.)<br>

Cslagen uses codesmith to process the templates and output the code, but it does so internally. You have no interaction with codesmith whatsoever.<br>Also, the app uses the free version of codesmith (v2.6).<br><br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DesNolan replied on Wednesday, September 05, 2007</h2>Andres,<br>

I did check out your stuff recently, and was quite impressed with it. <br>
<br>
And thanks for the post above, I thought CodeSmith had dropped the
freeware version along the way, but when I saw your post, I decided to
double check, and went to their site, typed in the word free and came
up with a link to their freeware verson 2.6 at
http://www.codesmithtools.com/freeware.aspx. (Commercial version of
CodeSmith is at verion 4 now, and costs about $300 per seat.)<br>
<br>
Andres, thanks for the lead, and your hard work on your extension of CodeSmith.<br>
