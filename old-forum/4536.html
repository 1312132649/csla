<P>My business objects, in this particular case, all override the Save methd and check to see if the user is able to save (by checking a shard CanEdit function.</P>
<P>When the control loads I also check the CanEdit method and Enable/Disable various controls based on if the user CanEdit, etc.</P>
<P>When I try to save the list it throws an error because the principal is no longer authenticated.&nbsp; </P>
<P>However, if I then go and make an edit on another list, that does NOT check CanEdit on Save all subsequent attempts to sav eth original list work.</P>
<P>It seems only if I try to save an object which shcecks on Save does the Principal appear to be InValid.</P>
<P>I realize WPF is not thread safe but should it either work or not?</P>
<P>I am using the latest code from the repository and have the same layout as ProjectTracker (Adding a Handler&nbsp;for DataPortalInitInvoke in the constructor)&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;Inheriting from a Base Form.</P>
<P>Does anybody have any insight?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
