<P>thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, January 22, 2008</h2>I think he's stated performance is the main reason.&nbsp; he's also taking a que from the framwork itself, where static methods will be thread safe, but instance members will not.&nbsp; If you need thread saftey, your application will have to code the appropriate locks.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, January 22, 2008</h2>Exactly.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jh72i replied on Tuesday, January 22, 2008</h2><DIV>I've always thought that was the main reason but thanks for reiterating.</DIV>

<DIV>As an aside I'm not sure its possible to wrap all the functionality necessary in subclasses - for full thread safety you'd have to lock each iteration of/access to the List but not all methods/etc. are virtual/non private/etc.</DIV>
