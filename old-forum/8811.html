I ended up using that in some talks at the Visual Studio 2010 launch last week, and have put the code online</p>

<p>Whether this Basic XAML Framework (Bxf) is useful to anyone or not I don&#39;t know - but it is now out there so you can look and see if it is valuable to you.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 19, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>Dan Billingsley<br></b></p>
<p>Does it play with Prism?</p>

<p>No, it is an illustration of how you can create a basic UI framework that might meet your needs that is much, much simpler than Prism.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t part of CSLA - it is just something I&#39;ve been using (in one form or another) to build various apps. Especially for my demos, Prism is super-overkill and requires bringing in Unity, which is super-super-overkill. When the support technology for a demo becomes so complex you need an hour or two to cover <i>that</i> before you can talk about the actual focus of the demo you know you are in deep trouble...</p>
<p>Bxf is, in my view, the minimum construct necessary to make MVVM work - something to route messages and something to construct views - all wrapped up in an implementation that can be entirely mocked out in a unit test environment.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Imker replied on Wednesday, April 21, 2010</h2><p>Thanks, I&#39;ll check it out for sure.</p>

<p>I like the idea of a minimalistic approach to check out MVVM&nbsp;and even improve my testability.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>asp2go replied on Monday, April 26, 2010</h2><p>Is this BXF framework adaptable back to CSLA version 3.8 ? Or is there anything that requires .Net 4 / CSLA 4?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 26, 2010</h2><p>It has very little dependency on CSLA - if I remember correctly it is just using a method out of Csla.Reflection that I didn&#39;t want to re-implement.</p>
<p>And it should have no dependency on SL4. It works in WPF or SL, and really has little to do with the actual XAML part of the UI at all.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
