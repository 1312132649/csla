<P>Instead of logging into the application as described in the book, I've changed my application to have the user log in before the application starts. I'm running everything on a pc as stand-alone like in the book.</P>
<P>Everything seems to be working&nbsp;and the user logging in is correctly authenticated, etc.</P>
<P>However, I would like to display user info as does the book, but the line:</P>
<P>System.Security.Principal.IPrincipal user = CSLA.ApplicationContext.User;</P>
<P>does not return the current logged in user info that was successfully authenticated, but returns null for Name and False for IsAuthenticated.</P>
<P>Does anyone have ideas, suggestions?</P>
<P>Regards</P>
