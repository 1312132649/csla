<P>PLEASE tell me which, if any, writer to use if I intend to take advantage of the CSLA frameworks remote reporting features. I think this thread could be&nbsp;helpfull to a lot of&nbsp;people, as Google couldn't even provide samples after hours of searching.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>robert_m replied on Monday, July 14, 2008</h2>We've been using Developer Express XtraReports in combination with CSLA for some time now and it works just fine.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>john_t replied on Monday, July 14, 2008</h2><P>Thanks for replying to my inquery Robert. I looked up XtraReports and an really disappointed the only person that replyed to my request so far doesn't even use Crystal reports or Report Viewer for CSLA reporting and had to purchase a completely different report writer then whats available in Visual Studio. I purchase Rockfords book, and didn't really find a report remoting solution either.</P>
<P>Did you try to remote with Crystal reports or Report Viewer, and find neither could work with remoting in the CSLA framework, or was XtraReports just a writer you used prior to adopting the CSLA framework and simply wanted to stick to it?</P>
<P>thanks again</P>
