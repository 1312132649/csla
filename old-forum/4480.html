<P>I realize this might be related to ASP.NET itself and not CSLA.NET, but I haven't been able to find a solution in ASP.NET forums, please shine a light on me :-)</P>
<P>I have a web user control which contains a GridView with a list of questions / responses, and a DetailsView that displays the selected&nbsp;question / response&nbsp;from the GridView.&nbsp; Both grid and details have templated fields.</P>
<P>When I set the DetailsView in Edit mode, change a few fields then hit the Edit link the following happens (or does not happen):</P>
<P>1) If I do a myDetailsView.DataBind() inside the Page_Load when IsPostBack() = true, the CslaDataSource Update method fires just fine, but the UpdateObjectArgs contain the same data the detailsView had before I changed it and hit Edit.&nbsp; I realize this probably has to do with DataBinding it.</P>
<P>2) If I DO NOT issue the myDetailsView.DataBind() inside the Page_Load when IsPostBack() = true, then the Update method does not fire at all!</P>
<P>So my question to you is, what am I missing here???</P>
<P>I will post code if required but it's a very simple bare-bones web user control slapped onto a web form.&nbsp; I assume I'm overlooking something very simple here!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Many thanks!</P>

<P>I re-created the page one control at a time, and I was able to get all the events working properly.</P>
<P>So then I proceeded to paste the code to my original page and guess what!</P>
<P>The update event ceased to work again!</P>
<P>I narrowed it down to using a Master Page.&nbsp; Basically I have this problem when my gridview / detailsview combo are inside a Content Page.&nbsp; If I put them in a regular page, the events work fine.</P>
<P>Stumped...</P>
