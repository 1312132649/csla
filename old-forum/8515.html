<p>Currently our silverlight apps use CSLA to download the object graphs and this is working perfectly. A requirement is that if a one user changes a part of the object graph then any other connected user must see that change without actively refreshing. Sort of like a data polling style situation.</p>
<p>Ive been also reading about Silverlight 3 Duplex Support and am wondering is there any scope of CSLA to be able to support this style of data sync.</p>
<p>Anyone got any thoughts?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t implement a pub/sub framework independent of the data portal and use it in your app.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
