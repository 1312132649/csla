<P>site, but I just couldn't stand the look of my original creation.&nbsp; You guys </P>
<P>should have told me how gastly it looked.</P>
<P>Anyway the new site is out there for all to use.&nbsp; You folks using CSLA 2.0 </P>
<P>and are posting on Rocky's new forum at least go on over and check it out.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I think it looks so much better than the last one.&nbsp; The search results </P>
<P>should be a little better as well.</P>
<P>There is a link to the new site at the top of the old site, but here is the </P>

<P>I doubt you've wasted your time as I'm sure at least you got some good experience updating it! ;)</P>
<P>Plus, at this point it appears we will still need your site to&nbsp;search the old messages...</P>
<P>The new site looks good, but I couldn't create a user as it didn't like my password no matter what I typed..</P>

<P>Terrence</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Patrick replied on Sunday, May 07, 2006</h2>Hi Terrence,<br><br>the page looks very nice. The only thing I would suggest is to allow users to view messages without needing to create an account. It might turn people away from using it.<br><br>All the best<br>Patrick<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Terrence replied on Monday, May 08, 2006</h2><P>Patrick, I gave it a lot of thought, and decided to put a password on it so I could at least tell how many people where using the site.&nbsp; I know I can tell that from unique IP addresses, but it is a lot easier with passwords.</P>
<P>If you had a problem with creating an account at the search site, did you have a problem creating an account&nbsp;on this site and the previous csla forum site?&nbsp; If not, why would there be a resistance to creating an account at the search site?</P>
<P>Thanks for your feedback.</P>
<P>Terrence.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Patrick replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Hi 
Terrence,<br><br>thanks for your answer. I can imagine that it is nice to see 
how many people use the search after putting so much work into it. My feeling 
comes probably from being accustomed to using the internet in certain ways. To 
view a forum, search the internet, read an article I normally don't need a 
password. To post in a forum, read emails, administer something etc. I do need a 
password. In this regard I felt I hesitated to create an account to be able to 
search as I already have so many different accounts <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />. But sure if I really 
needed to I would. <br>I totally respect your wish I just wanted to have 
mentioned it.<br><br>All the best from Australia<br>Patrick</font></font></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
