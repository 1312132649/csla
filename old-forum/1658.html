The change log for v2.1 states this about the CslaDataSource<br><i><br>Implement support for paged and sorted data sources. There are now properties on the control so you can indicate whether the underlying data source supports paging or sorting. This way, if you bind to a SortedBindingList, for instance, you can indicate that the data source supports sorting to expose sorting support at a higher level.<br><br>Coupled with the new IReportTotalRowCount interface, the ability to indicate that a data source supports paging provides a relatively easy way to create a paged list that works property when bound to a grid control.<br><br></i>Does this mean that all I have to do, once I have changed my db calls, is to set the property on the CslaDataSource and the grid control will do the rest?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xAvailx replied on Wednesday, November 01, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>Bayu:</strong></div><div>You have 2 choices:<br><br>- hit the DB for every page, then at least you should modify your Criteria class so you specify the offset and limit for your SQL query. <br><br>- or hit the DB once to retrieve the whole bunch and paginate this set in your control, then it is strictly a UI thing and you would have to tune your Grid control so it pages through your data.<br><br><br>Usually the latter is recommended, unless you have really big resultsets. <br><br>Bayu<br></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>I am not sure I would ever recommend the second choice in a web environment.
