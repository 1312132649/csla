I really respect that.<br><br>The scenario: <br>Client - Server application, the data portal is hosted in the server as a WCF service (WcfPortal) and is accessible though a netTcpBinding endpoint.<br>I want to maintain a list of entities in the server application and to be able to notify <br>all server clients when a change in the list occured for some reason (for example some new items arrived from an external system).<br>1.

In this post, Rocky says that this feature is not<br>directly supported by the CSLA framework, but that it is possible to implement such remote event notification (by using a MarshalByRef observer etc - details at the specified link).<br><br>However, I was not able to do it until now. I'm just asking myself if is there any chance that I could implement this feature together with my CSLA business objects, or I should drop the idea and simply use the standard CallbackContract from WCF?<br><br>Did anyone use a similar scenario until now?<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>P.S.
