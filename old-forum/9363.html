<p>This is because, as a general rule, data binding requires a singular object against which it can bind. Data binding ignores properties on list objects - assuming the list is only interesting due to the things it contains.</p>
<p>In other words, even if I allowed a BLB to directly contain other BLB objects, data binding would (almost never) work with your objects.</p>
<p>Since one of the primary features of the editable object stereotypes is to support data binding, this is against their goal.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SeanO replied on Wednesday, August 11, 2010</h2><p>Thanks. &nbsp;That probably actually makes more sense for my object model&#39;s design anyway.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
