<p>I&#39;m currently reading about EF4 and thought it would be really cool to be able to generate the CSLA-BOs directly from the EDM using a t4 template. All the properties and all the DataAccess code could be generated. Using partial classes would make it terribly easy to add the rest like the rules etc.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t looked into it further yet, but I was wondering if anyone has already tried this.</p>

I don&#39;t know how far they are with the project, but the effort exists.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lukky replied on Friday, April 09, 2010</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Look for the T4CSLA project on Codeplex.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been quiet for a while, but the basics look good.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done modifications of the template on my side to match it to my liking, but I&#39;m not finished yet, and if I release it, you&#39;d still have some work to do.</p>
<p>Let me know if you&#39;d like to look at my mods.</p>
<p>Regards</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
