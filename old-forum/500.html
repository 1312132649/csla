"<br><br>Trusting the assembly also doesn't seem to work. <br><br>Any ideas?<br>Thanks<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, June 28, 2006</h2>Some more info..<br><br>My assembly seems to load fine, but its getting a security exection when calling the&nbsp; System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.GetSection method.<br><br>The section however is read by a custom section handler (defined in the same assembly as the one doing the call above).&nbsp; So for some reason, my assembly loads, but the CLR can't create an object from that assembly.. wierd.<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 28, 2006</h2>There is an attribute called something like AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers, which is important to use when building objects that might be loaded in IE. This may be a requirement for Outlook too.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, June 29, 2006</h2>Well, that worked.<br><br>I was very suprised though, because the assembly I marked with the attribute WAS loading and executing code, so I was suprised that calling that method would trigger the message.<br><br>Thanks!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
