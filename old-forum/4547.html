<P>We will be using CSLA for our business objects and I'm clear on how to develop the service application (using WCF) for the most part.&nbsp; We will have a couple of clients apps with more in the future.&nbsp; The first&nbsp;release will have an ASP.NET web app and a WinForms or WPF client app both driven from the service application.</P>
<P>I know Rocky has the BenchManager application and I've reviewed the MS StockTrader app, but we are beyond both of those.&nbsp; I'm looking for some real world, more complex&nbsp;examples that may touch upon a few areas of particular interest, such as lookup list management, shared code across all three applications (server, web &amp; win clients), security&nbsp;and so on.&nbsp; If they use CSLA, even better!!!</P>
<P>Thanks in advance!</P>

<P>It's one of those MS blown out apps that use one of each of their technologies....I think they even threw in Microsoft BOB... :-)</P>
<P>But seriously check it out...there's a lot there.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Tuesday, March 25, 2008</h2><P>This looks like a great example.&nbsp; Thanks for sharing!!!</P>
