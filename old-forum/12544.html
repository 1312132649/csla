<p>Still rumours, but I can&#39;t think why Microsoft wouldn&#39;t do it. &nbsp;It would be a huge win for them.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Monday, April 07, 2014</h2><p>Wow, Universal applications look really promising. &nbsp;I wonder how this will play into the whole question. &nbsp;Perhaps the Universal shared project would be a better solution than PCLs?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, April 10, 2014</h2><p>We don&#39;t currently support a PCL with CSLA, primarily because the lowest common denominator is pretty low compared to some of the features we are currently able to implement via multi-targeting.</p>
<p>That said, CSLA 4.5.500 supports the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>.NET (ASP.NET, WPF, Windows Forms)</li>
<li>Silverlight 5</li>
<li>Windows Phone (Silverlight/WinPRT)</li>
<li>Android via Xamarin</li>
<li>iOS via Xamarin</li>
<li>Linux/OS X via mono</li>
<li>WinRT</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also support the new Universal App model announced at Build. In fact we might already support it thanks to our support for WinRT, but I want to confirm that&#39;s true before making such a statement.</p>
<p>Once we support the Universal App model (which Xamarin will support as well) then via that avenue we&#39;ll reach the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>WinRT (Windows 8)</li>
<li>WinRT (Windows Phone 8.1)</li>
<li>WinRT (Xbox - presumably at some point anyway)</li>
<li>Android</li>
<li>iOS</li>
<li>OS X (if Xamarin releases a product for OS X as rumored)</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, you shouldn&#39;t have to give up CSLA just to reach these platforms. In fact, if you are using CSLA it will make your life almost infinitely easier when you want to move to these platforms because all your business code will work unchanged.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, April 22, 2014</h2><p>I do plan to support the Universal PCL model and have started that work</p>
