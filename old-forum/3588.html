<P>I have a winform application and implemented an export button, when the user clicks the export button, I'd like to invoke a standard "File Download" Dialog Box like in IE&nbsp;that will allow user to open the .csv file in the browser when&nbsp;Open button is clicked&nbsp;and saves the .csv file when Save button is clicked.&nbsp; This is all straightforward if it was a web application.&nbsp; But as for a windows application, there is only an Open File Dialog Box and a Save File Dialog Box.&nbsp; </P>
<P>My question is:</P>
<P>Is it possible to invoke the "File Download" Dialog Box like in IE in a winform application?</P>
<P>Or do I have to write my own?</P>
<P>Thank you for any inputs.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><FONT color=#000000>What I really want to implement is a ’save as’ dialog with an additional ‘open’ button… <I>similar</I> to the I.E. ‘file download’ dialog.</FONT></SPAN></P>
