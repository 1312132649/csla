<P>I have begun working on the VB portion of my site.&nbsp; I'll try to get through it as quickly as i can since it is effectively just translating the code snippets over to VB from the C# I already have posted.</P>
<P>Depending on work commitments and other demands on my time i'll try to have it all done in the next 2 -3 weeks but please don't hold me to it.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>I have just completed a first draft of the VB CSLA 2.0 notes.&nbsp; I still haven't got round to writing up editable root collections but I'll get that done soon.</P>
<P>Hope these notes help some folk and please remember that there will be small discrepencies between the C# notes and the VB notes as I will not have translated them perfectly <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>I have posted a first draft of the notes for Editable Root Collections up to my site for both VB and C# CSLA 2.0</P>
<P>Hope that helps some folk and sorry for the delay.</P>
<P>My plans now are to knock up some more articles for the tips and tricks section and possibly an application along with a design document that should demonstrate how CSLA can be used.</P>
<P>Have fun</P>
