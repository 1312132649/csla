<P>Just wondering, would it be possible to add a method to the RemotingHost that would enable me to connect to it and add/remove a TraceListener?&nbsp; We are currently outputing (is that a word?) lots of information using a custom TraceListener but we don't want it being output all the time.&nbsp; I know you can add/remove listeners via the web.config file but this is not ideal when you have multiple servers.&nbsp; The ideal scenario would be to connect to the server process and turn on/off tracing on demand but I can't find out if it is possible.</P>
<P>Thanks for any help/input.</P>

You can add an asmx or another remoting endpoint to that same virtual root.</P>
<P>The real challenge is whether you can dynamically add a TraceListener, and that I don't know. But adding an asmx and associated code file to your virtual root is a very easy way to accomplish your goal, because then you'll just have a public web service against which you can write an admin client tool.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>razorkai replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2><P>This is interesting as we are hosting in IIS.&nbsp; You can dynamically add/remove TraceListeners at runtime in a winforms app, so I am hoping the concept will work.&nbsp; So if I added a webservice to my virtual root that allowed me to do this, would the dataportal calls see the change?&nbsp; I am guessing that depends on the scope of the TraceListeners collection.&nbsp; I'll give it a go!</P>
