<P>Right now, CodeSmith is giving me a business object with only a ReadOnly User_ID property. What would be the best way to get around this? I obviously don't want to remove the&nbsp;uniqueness of User_ID&nbsp;from my database as then we could have multiple records for a user and we don't want that.</P>
<P>Thanks for the input,<BR>Will</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tray replied on Monday, February 12, 2007</h2><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hi Will,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Having a unique key that is settable seams to point in the direction of the 'ExistsCommand'.</FONT></P>

<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>If you make the User_ID property read/write this will allow the user to set the property.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>In the validation rules, use the ExistsCommand to check that the value <STRONG>is</STRONG> actually unique. If it isn't, the object will become invalid and will not be able to be saved preventing duplicate indexes.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>See how you go.</FONT></P>
