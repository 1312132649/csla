<P>It looks like this has been asked before, but I dont seem to find any thing that works from the threads I have reviewed so far.</P>
<P>I am trying to create reports in Microsofts built in report viewer where they are&nbsp; based on objectdatasources (for me obviously on business objects in my class library).</P>
<P>Most of the literature indicates that objectdatasources will see anything in the app_code folder (ie if you define your class for your business object there). But what happens if you have them (as CSLA framework shows) in a class library?</P>
<P>When I use the objectdatasource it seems to find my business objects but not as&nbsp;'data' objects. So when it propts you in the wizard to identify what method to select from the business object, a whole list of&nbsp; methods get listed that have nothing to do with the ones i explicitly created. As an example if I was looking for a method for 'select' it would be ProjectList.GetProjectList- but this isnt listed among them.</P>
<P>If I follow the walkthrough, it seems they would have you create a class in the appcode folder and then everything is found. But Im not sure why I would want to do that if they are already defined in the libary. Can a library be put into the appcode folder?</P>
<P>These are probably dumb questions. Any answers and/or code examples would be appreciated. Failing that, I would likely have to create server side reports and I would prefer not to do that.</P>
<P>Im running VS2005 SP1 and SQLServer 2005</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Lyndon replied on Thursday, September 13, 2007</h2>sorry never mind= dumb error on my part - it&nbsp; now works</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
