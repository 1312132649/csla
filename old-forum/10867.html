<p>What do I need to do if I want the view that got plugged into the aforementioned region to have a similar structure (ex -&nbsp;its own content control that can be populated with subviews)?&nbsp; Do I (or can I) still use the ShowView method to populate a content control in this view with subviews?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, November 12, 2011</h2><p>You should ask this in the bxf discussion forum on codeplex.</p>
<p>The short answer is that this isn&#39;t supported. Bxf is designed to support some relatively basic scenarios for the purpose of teaching people the concepts of MVVM, writing CSLA demos, and building relatively straightforward apps.</p>
<p>To make this work though, wouldn&#39;t be <em>that</em> hard. Bxf uses a singleton model for the shell instance. What is needed is a slight alteration so Bxf would allow multiple shell instances. One main shell instance for the app, and then individual shell instances for regions that want to have sub-regions.</p>
<p>The potential good news? Bxf is open source, and I&#39;m very happy to allow people to make enhancements to the framework - as long as the framework remains simple enough that it can be used for teaching MVVM concepts. A change like I&#39;m talking about would be a fine thing :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
