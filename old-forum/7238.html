<P>With a remote data portal that should work as you expect - you'll get notified on deserialization when the object graph hits the server, and again when the object graph rematerializes on the client.</P>
<P>With a local data portal, the serialization occurs before the save, not after, because the object graph is cloned and the cloned graph is saved, and if that succeeds it is returned to the caller without being re-serialized.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Tuesday, July 07, 2009</h2><font face="Arial" size="2">I think the event you are referring to is OnDeserialized() which still exists!</font><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
