<P>I'm sure there is a really simple answer to this, but I could do with some best practice advice on the following please...</P>
<P>I have a simple business object based on BusinessBase. Let's assume, to keep things easy, that its associated with a Customer, and is called BoCustomer. Ideally I want to be able to fetch a customer based on two parameters,&nbsp;firstly by its integer id,&nbsp;or secondly, by its string customer reference.</P>
<P>So, I have two public methods in my business object, the first being BoCustomer.GetByCustomerID(int customerID), and the second being BoCustomer.GetByCustomerReference(string customerReference).</P>
<P>Both use the SingleCriteria class to pass the appropriate reference&nbsp;parameter to the DataPortal_Fetch() method of the BO.</P>
<P>Given that I call a different stored procedure depending on whether I am&nbsp;getting a customer by its&nbsp;id or by its reference, and I am dealing with data of different types, I have assumed that two data portal fetch methods is the right approach. One&nbsp;requires&nbsp;a SingleCriteria&lt;BoCustomer, int&gt; parameter, and the other a&nbsp;&nbsp;SingleCriteria&lt;BoCustomer, string&gt;&nbsp;. One calls the stored procedure to fetch a customer by its ID, and the other calls the stored procedure to fetch a customer by its reference.</P>
<P>Is this the right way to go, or is there a better way to do it...?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

Hopefully with a third, private, method that I can pass the open datareader (or whatever) so it can load the object's property values consistently regardless of the sproc you called.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>NickTaylor replied on Friday, January 08, 2010</h2><P>Many thanks for that Rocky, I just wanted to be sure I was heading down the right road.</P>
<P>And yes, I would have a common Load(SqlDataReader dr) method that loads the BO properties irrespective of which method was originally called to query the DB.</P>
<P>Many thanks for your response,</P>
