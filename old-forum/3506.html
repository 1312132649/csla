It makes sense, but it also is not necessary given that we already had IBindingList.</P>
<P>And that's what makes it interesting. Windows Forms uses IBindingList, and doesn't know about INotifyCollectionChanged. So if you want to work with Windows Forms, you must use IBindingList, not INotifyCollectionChanged.</P>
<P>WPF on the other hand, knows about <EM>both interfaces</EM>. So if you want to work with the broadest set of technologies you'd opt for IBindingList, but if you <EM>only want to work with WPF</EM> then you'd opt for INotifyCollectionChanged.</P>
<P>In 3.0.0 I implemented <EM>both</EM> interfaces. That was a mistake, because WPF honors both - resulting in duplicate event processing and lists getting messed up in the display. So in 3.0.1 I reverted to IBindingList, because CSLA supports all current UI technologies.</P>
<P>.NET 3.5 won't change this dynamic, because (to my knowledge) they still aren't changing Windows Forms to honor the new interface. Therefore CSLA must continue to use IBindingList.</P>
<P>But that's OK - it isn't like INotifyCollectionChanged offers any advantage over IBindingList. So CSLA doesn't lose anything by supporting the older (and richer) interface. Rather it gains a great deal by sticking with the more broadly used interface.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
