For an overview of this project, see <A href="http://www.codeplex.com/CslaVSTemplates">http://www.codeplex.com/CslaVSTemplates</A></P>
<P>This initial release is for C# 2.0, and I will attempt to port these to VB 2.0 once I get the C# version out of beta.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BBM replied on Wednesday, November 15, 2006</h2><P>Hi mobile5guy.</P>
<P>Are you porting the templates that come with the CSLA download or are you writing your own?</P>
<P>I've used the ones that come with the download, and while they're certainly much better than starting from scratch they're not always complete.</P>
<P>I know - now your going to ask me HOW they're not complete, and I don't think I can answer that.&nbsp; I just remember coming across things I had to add to my production classes that made me think "why wasn't that in the template?</P>
<P>Since I know you're working on this now, I'll be in touch if I run across any more of these situations.</P>
<P>Thanks for taking this up.</P>

The templates I am working on are actually visual studio ItemTemplates. For example, when you add a new BusinessBase class, I capture the file name, and create the class with that name, just like adding a normal Class within visual studio.<br><br>example code:<br>public class $safeitemrootname$ : BusinessBase&lt;$safeitemrootname$&gt;</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Wednesday, November 15, 2006</h2><P>Thanks for doing this!&nbsp; Much needed!</P>
<P>Two quick items:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Be sure to use the comments when you check in code to csla contrib.&nbsp; That way, we know what you added/changed with each check-in. :)</LI>
<LI>Now that an object can be saved with broken rules, we need to check the rule status when an object is re-loaded from the database.&nbsp; Not sure that the current templates take that into account.</LI></UL></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
