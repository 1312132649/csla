<P>Several ProjectTracker 3.0 projects were built using Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2. The tool support in VS 2005 is simply not mature and won't be a long-term answer for anyone doing WPF, WCF or WF, and so I built those solutions using the technology Microsoft will support going forward.</P>
<P>I know this causes some short-term pain, but it was unrealistic to try and use the half-baked VS 2005 tools to do real work, and I wanted to get this stuff running and working in a forward-looking manner.</P>
<P>Check the readme.txt file in the download to see which projects are VS 2008 and which are VS 2005.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
