<p>Any ideas?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, March 01, 2010</h2><p>Are you sure you have the <em>exact same Csla.dll</em> referenced in your project as you do in the VS Toolbox? Same dll, from the same location? Not one release the other debug or anything like that.</p>
<p>I seem to recall that the Windows Forms designer is really picky about some of those things, especially if you have any usercontrol or other control types in your actual project that subclass or use Csla.dll.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, March 01, 2010</h2><p>No, I don&#39;t.&nbsp; Looks like I&#39;ll need to figure out how to get .Net to trust my R: drive, which is a network driver where the release csla is kept.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
