I have a Web Application which I am putting in some user controls as web parts. </p>
<p>These user controls use CSLA as data source and I am trying to fetch data for my CSLA object asynchronously.</p>
<p>Is anyone can tell me how please, I am quite new to this asynchronously fetch data!</p>
<p>I won&#39;t be able to use sliverlight or WPF etc. Is there any thing in CSLA that return IAsyncResult object so that I can use Page.RegisterAsyncTask on page?</p>
<p>Any help appreciated!</p>

The data portal itself is synchronous. We implemented an asynchronous wrapper that uses the evening model established by Silverlight. You could create similar techniques to build a Task wrapper.</p>

<p>We plan to do this for version 4.5, but we don&#39;t have it now.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>porsonw replied on Tuesday, October 18, 2011</h2><p>Thank you very much for the quick reply! I will take a look at the CSLA 4 code for the sliverlight sample.</p>
<p>Thanks again. :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
