<p>How you handle the list of databases/connectionstrings is entirely up to your application.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>CraigJ replied on Wednesday, August 07, 2013</h2><p>Thanks.&nbsp; I found a prior post from Rocky that helped me with this.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;">This suggests to use the CSLA.ApplicationContext.ClientContext to keep track of the connection string.&nbsp; I modified the ADOHelper class to look to that collection for the proper connection string instead of the config file. </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
