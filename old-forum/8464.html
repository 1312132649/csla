But DataAnnotation.ValidationAttribute can be applied to the class itself when multiple fields are to be used for validation (like PropertiesMustMatch attribute from the MVC2).<br /><br />Are you planning to add support for them?<br /><br />Thanks</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 03, 2010</h2><P>That is a good point. In .NET 3.5 SP1 that wasn't possible, and it hadn't occurred to me that the new 4.0 ValidationAttribute model (which was really introduced in SL3) would work at a class level. But of course it would.</P>
<P>So the answer is yes&nbsp; :)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
