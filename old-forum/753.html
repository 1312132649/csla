<P>I started getting messages from MSN yesterday asking me to approve/disapprove requests from folks trying to join the old forum.&nbsp; There were four of them.&nbsp; I just sent an email to them telling them no one would see their posting there in any event and that they should use the NEW forum.&nbsp; Then I disapproved those requests.</P>
<P>But I got a reply from one of them saying that he was trying to download an attachment from one of the threads there and needed a membership to do so.&nbsp; This seems reasonable enough, so I told him to re-apply so that I could let him in (and sent him the file he was trying to get, too).</P>
<P>I got a request from three more this morning and just sent a message warning them of the folly of posting there, but told them I was approving their requests specifically for access to those attachments.</P>
<P>I hope this is how you want things run over there and will continue to do so unless I hear a different request from you.</P>
<P>Thanks for all you do for us!</P>
