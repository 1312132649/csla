<P>The application is an ASP.NET 2.0 web application using themes, master pages, AJAX (including the AJAX Control Toolkit), disciplined CSS styling and data-binding in the CSLA way (using the ObjectDataSource object).&nbsp; Most of the application is stubbed out and the majority of business objects are in place.&nbsp; We need someone to take the existing application and implement the remaining features.&nbsp; This will include some BO work as well.</P>
<P>This is phase 1 of the project and good quality along with rapid results will most likely lead to an offer of more work as the application moves forward.&nbsp; Compensation is negotiable.</P>
<P>The real kicker is that we have an 8/1 delivery date and we must do our best to meet it or minimize our tardiness.&nbsp; So our need is urgent and immediate.&nbsp; If you are interested but do not have the ability to commit to helping for the next week or so, please indicate this and we will keep your information on file for future needs.</P>
<P>Please send your resume along with a list of reference sites and compensation requirements to <A href="mailto:sonofpirate@hotmail.com">sonofpirate@hotmail.com</A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; What is the status on your project?&nbsp; Are you still looking for a lead developer?&nbsp; I have quite a bit of experience in programming, asp.net 2.0, and CSLA.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I'm in Kansas City, but&nbsp;if you're still looking for someone, please contact me.</P>
