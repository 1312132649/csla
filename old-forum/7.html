<P>Plan to migrate all the archives, or, just search both?<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Also, I remember there is a long thread about the structure of the new forum. Any thoughts?<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, May 05, 2006</h2><P>I know that I don't have the time to figure out how to migrate the old content to Community Server. If someone wants to figure out how to do this I'm certainly open to the idea. CS 2.0 runs against a SQL 2005 database, so it might be possible for someone to write a direct database import of some sort - I don't know.</P>
<P>Regarding the structure of the new forum, I thought we'd start with small first, and branch out if needed. Forums that have too many areas typically have areas that are simply not used, so adding a new top-level forum should only be done if it will contain&nbsp;a vibrant discussion (imo anyway).</P>
<P>It is also the case that I have limited email addresses to allocate to the forums. Each forum that wants email support consumes one of my addresses. There's no real limit on the number of web-only forums I can create, but only a small number can have email support like this General Discussion forum.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Sunday, May 07, 2006</h2><P>I don't think moving everything from the old forum to this one is worth the effort.&nbsp; Terrance has just completed revamping SearchCSLA and it looks awesome.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A href="/forums/thread/65.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/65.aspx</A></P>
<P>Plus the fact that CSLA2.0 is out, it makes somewhat very good sense to just start on clean slate and leave the old forum as-is given the new SearchCSLA - thank you Terrance!</P>
<P>One thing I do suggest though would be to LOCK down the old forum and redirect (automatically or not) everybody to this site so that they'd be force to post here instead.&nbsp; </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cjherasmus replied on Sunday, May 07, 2006</h2><P><FONT face=Verdana>Hi Rocky,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>a suggestion maybe... two top level branches, i.e. CSLA 1.5x and CSLA 2.x, since there's a difference between them.</FONT></P>

It'd be a good idea to have a big header in the old forum pointing to this one and locking it out....<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
