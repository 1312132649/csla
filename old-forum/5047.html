<p class=MsoNormal><span>I would say that the best way to learn Csla 3.5 is a private
one-on-one training with Rocky (take couple of days for example)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Since the option stated above is not likely, perhaps it is time
to have another Csla Tech Night with focus on only 3.5 features &#8211; I find those
presentations extremely useful.&nbsp; And it has been a while since we have had one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hello all,<br>
<br>
I used CSLA 1.0 on a project a few years ago and loved it.&nbsp; I'm planning
on implementing the latest CSLA framework in some upcoming projects, but have
not used CSLA in quite a while and my co-workers have no experience in
it.&nbsp; I was wondering what the most straightforward method would be to
learn CSLA 3.5 from scratch.<br>
<br>
I see that there's a book planned for September that addresses the C# edition,
but we use VB.NET.&nbsp; From what I've seen here on the site, learning the
latest version would require reading at least one book and then reading up on
the updates to 3.5.&nbsp; It's also not clear whether the 3.0 handbook is a
good place to start from scratch or if prior understanding of the framework is
required.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
<br>
<o:p></o:p></p>

<P>I think that right now the best and most efficient way to get a group up to speed on 3.5 is the training available from Dunn Training.</P>
<P>You are right, to get to 3.0 you need to read <EM>Expert 2005 Business Objects</EM>, and the <EM>CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</EM> ebook and (if you are using WPF/WCF/WF) the <EM>Using CSLA .NET 3.0</EM> ebook. Then you'd still need to infer a lot of the 3.5 feature changes by looking at the ProjectTracker code and/or reading the posts here and on my blog.</P>
<P>I am working on <EM>Expert 2008 Business Objects</EM>, but it is slow going, not in small part because I'm also working on CSLA Light (CSLA .NET for Silverlight) - and there are only so many hours in the day (sometimes I really begrudge the need for sleep).</P>
<P>At this point I expect <EM>Expert C# 2008 Business Objects</EM> to be out near the end of the year, with the VB edition coming out early next year.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ash002 replied on Wednesday, July 02, 2008</h2>Expert BOs is great. Chapters 1 &amp; 2 why and what, but after that skip to chapter 8 &amp; 9 to get yourself grounded in an actual example of how, then back to chapter 6 &amp; 7 for more theory.<br><div></div></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ianinspain replied on Friday, July 04, 2008</h2><P>This is great news!, i have the original (in print) book for 2.0 ... but after all the patches and downloadable pdf's i have put off putting any effort in the update it.. Just too many patches and too many bits of documentation.... i was going crazy...</P>
<P>This is not due to the price fo the pdf's - that doesn't bother me, just too much flicking from one book to another to another...</P>
<P><BR>I can't wait for the new in print book, i presume this will cover from KNOWLEDGE = 0 up to the latest version??????</P>
<P>Any info you can offer on this would be really great!</P>
<P>It would be really nice to just sit down with 1 book and work through it again..</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, July 12, 2008</h2><P>At present, the plan is for <EM>Expert 2008 Business Objects</EM> to follow the same basic structure as <EM>Expert 2005 Business Objects</EM> did, though the chapters will break out differently.</P>
<P>The framework has grown way too large to walk through the code in the detail I have in the past. So the chapters dealing with the framework implementation will be at a higher level and will focus more on the design decisions than on the code detail. And I'm breaking the topics up differently so they (hopefully) are more organized.</P>
<P>There will still be a chapter (or 2) covering ProjectTracker.Library and how it is created. And that will be at the same code-focused level as in 2005.</P>
<P>And then there'll be chapters covering three interfaces: WPF, Web Forms and WCF services.</P>
<P>My current plan is to do small ebooks for Windows Forms, ASP.NET MVC and&nbsp;Windows Workflow - basically each one like a very focused (and somewhat longer) chapter on that specific interface technology.</P>
<P>So yes, the book will start at 0 (assuming 0 is an already competent .NET developer), and will walk through the philosophy, design and implementation of CSLA .NET, and then into using it in some scenarios. Pretty much like the 2005 book.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vdhant replied on Sunday, July 13, 2008</h2>Can't wait for the books... The one that i am most looking forward to is seeing what your thoughts on ASP.NET MVC are.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bt1 replied on Tuesday, July 15, 2008</h2><P>Hey, is there any way to get access to the e-book as it is being written.&nbsp; I know other publishers have a way to do that such as the "Rough Cuts" <A href="http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=135396">http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=135396</A></P>
<P>It allows you to buy a copy of the e-book and download versions of the book as it is being written and also a final copy once complete.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>If you haven't guessed I also would like to use CSLA3.5 on a project that has started but am suffering from finding sources to learn the new version (only used 1.1 previously).&nbsp; I don't like the Idea of trying to figure out which techniques goes with which version 1.1&nbsp;2.0 2.1 3.0 3.5.&nbsp; I would like to just learn the current technique to do CSLA.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Also, why isn't this fourm organized by version.&nbsp; It is rather difficult to look for help on something then figure out what version the info was applicable to.</P>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span>Expert 2008 Business Objects</span></i><span> isn&#8217;t an ebook,
it is a traditional book published by Apress. You&#8217;ll have to look at <a href="http://www.apress.com">www.apress.com</a> to see if they are doing an
electronic pre-released. I know they do that with some books.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>There was a lot of discussion a few years ago when I set up the
forum, about splitting it into many little groups or leaving it as one. I do
have a hard limit, in that I only have so many email addresses I can use. So I could
create (and have created) some forums that aren&#8217;t email enabled, but that
isn&#8217;t real satisfying for a primary forum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>At some point I&#8217;ll get time to upgrade the software. It has
supported tagging for some time now, I just haven&#8217;t had time to do the
upgrade. But I think good use of tags would help in many ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
