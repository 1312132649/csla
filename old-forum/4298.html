data model.&nbsp; With IBatis, *you* write the database queries, just like
you would with ADO, so there's nothing to say you can't have a
ten-table join for a single BO, or a single table behind ten different
BOs.</div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>Ahh, yes that is a mis-understanding, which comes about from me not knowing enough about IBatis.&nbsp; Certainly sounds interesting, its a shame you need to ditch the dataportal concept to use it.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
