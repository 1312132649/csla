The Client object definitely exists and I reset the CanEditObject to
just return true, and finally removed Client.CanEditObject and set
Visible = true<br>
<br>
Nothing seems to work.&nbsp; Ideas?<br>

On the form, I can refresh the control and it detects the fields in the
business object.&nbsp; That is what Rows refers to, right?&nbsp; So why
is it unable to count Rows?<br>
<br>
Is this related to the csla DataSource problem discussed here?<br>

http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/2093.aspx.&nbsp; I thought I'd found a work around, and at least the control displays.<br>
<br>
 Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; Now I know what is wrong, but I have absolutely no idea of how to fix this.&nbsp; <br>
