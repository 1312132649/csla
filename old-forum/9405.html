<p>I need a hook into Csla.Server.DataPortal to run my bootstrap code.&nbsp; A client that may be running n-tier cannot call ServerBootstrap because the assemblies wont be there.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about bootstrapping in the Ioc / DI context, then I think my answer will work fine for you.&nbsp; I&#39;m coming from a background in StructureMap though, so maybe your IoC container doesn&#39;t have similar features.</p>
<p>Anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp;your client code (before it shows any forms) can ask StructureMap to scan the folder containing the executing assembly to find any Registry classes.&nbsp; So for server only stuff you put your registry classes only in your server side assemblies.&nbsp; Since they won&#39;t get deployed, those registries won&#39;t be found and thus nothing scanned.&nbsp; Same goes for your client assemblies on the server side.&nbsp; Common registries should be in assemblies which will always be in both locations.</p>
<p>So like I said, I may be misunderstanding yoru question, and if I am please feel free to correct me!</p>
<p>HTH</p>
