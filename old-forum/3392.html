How could let the child know the parent object? or are there other alternatives for this problem? <br>Thank you<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Tuesday, August 28, 2007</h2><P>You could use the Contains method in the BO Child Collection.&nbsp; You can overload the method and change it to compare the child you are about to add with the children currently in the collection - perhaps on ID or some other criteria.</P>
<P>You could have an additional method on your parent object which lets you AddChildren and flags a problem to your UI if there is a matching child object already.&nbsp; Or in the Add method on the collection put the code there to check for existing children, returning nothing if it fails to be added.</P>
