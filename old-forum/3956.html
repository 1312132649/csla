But, based on your own experience, is it reasonable to create a medium or large project with no code generation (except maybe for code snippets)?<br><br>- Miguel<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ayubu replied on Wednesday, November 28, 2007</h2><P>Hi</P>
<P>for a large or medium coding buusiness objects&nbsp; manually is not reasonable and this is not only for CSLA.NET business objects but also for any persistable object, thanx for CSLA.NET that a code to make full fledged business objects is arleady implemented making code generation highly productive</P>
<P>A good number of code in the CSLA.NET based business objects are properties and also the approach is so good arranged that they follow a good hence using code generation a breeze.</P>
<P>However using code generation tools can be tempting making a developer think at first designing database, then from database ganerating business objects, which is not good as it will only make object a representing database tables and columns i.e normalizing data while in object world it is normalizing behaviour is required.</P>

You can always do a select into with appropriate joins to create a table that reflects the desired business object representation.  Using the DB schema does not force you to have a 1 to 1 mapping between business objects and tables.  Many people jump to this conclusion incorrectly.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pandelaras replied on Thursday, November 29, 2007</h2>plus,&nbsp;most code generators are based on csla 2.0. Usually its hard for to find any using the latest csla version.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Philip replied on Monday, January 14, 2008</h2><P>With so much pressure to deliver projects on time and reduce costs, I think Code Generation&nbsp; these days is&nbsp;almost a must. For my team it has become a neccessity.&nbsp; Beside there is a good deal of choice now on the market to choose from and Code Generators are getting better and better. There are several advantages&nbsp; in using Code Generation and the main one is&nbsp; to free programmers to concentrate on the areas that deserve better their brain power. Code Generation can also be a good mentor for developers and generated code is generally&nbsp; well written and consistent. I agree also that one of the main disadvantage with most Code Generators is that you have to start from a database model and the database must be well designed.</P>
<P>As for CSLA, I can inform you that Code Complete is dedicated to CSLA and always uses the latest version of CSLA.NET</P>

A first CTP Preview of the open source Tool will be released in march. For a first look you can press the View Demo button on the site.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mcsean replied on Monday, September 15, 2008</h2><P>the other one is Sculpture (<A href="http://www.codeplex.com/Sculpture">http://www.codeplex.com/Sculpture</A>) it does not target the CSLA.net framework, but templates can be created to work for CSLA. Doesn't know how much longer cslafactory need for the next release, but Sculpture has already been&nbsp;working with Linq. </P>
<P>If anyone&nbsp;guru out there is interested in writing a "mold", the templates in Sculpture's term, to work with CSLA. please let me know, we would like to help out!</P>
<P>cheers!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>coder replied on Sunday, October 12, 2008</h2><P>The gurus from Sculpture is writing the CSLA.net mold and it will be released&nbsp;with&nbsp;Sculpture beta 2, which is within a month time. Then there will be another codegen for CSLA.net -&nbsp;probably the first Visual Designer for CSLA&nbsp;to work&nbsp;with&nbsp;VS2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
