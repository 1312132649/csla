Are you sure you ran all the scripts, including the creation of the stored procedures, against the security database?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Monday, March 19, 2007</h2>Thanks for jumping in!<br><br>I think I have it solved.&nbsp; I looked for the umpteenth time at the connection string and realised I didn't need the "Data Source=" bit.&nbsp; Got rid of that and now I am up and running.<br><br>What I had done is to attach the databases to SQL Server so I didn't have to run any scripts for creating the databases.&nbsp; I double checked when I got the message that the stored procedures were there.<br><br>Thanks.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
