I'm trying CSLA for the first time although I have purchased and read all of the books including the 2.1 eBook.&nbsp; The version I'm using is the latest download i.e. 3.0.2-070727 on Vista 64 with VSS2005, IIS 7.0. So I have to translate the CSLA.NET 2.0 Build Instructions to a new environment I'm not familiar with so please excuse me. My problem is that when I build ProjectTracker (vb) I get the following error plus 10 others with the same message</P>
<P>Error&nbsp;1&nbsp;Request for the permission of type 'System.Web.AspNetHostingPermission, System, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' failed.&nbsp;U:\cslavb\ProjectTrackervb\www\PTWeb\ResourceList.aspx&nbsp;16&nbsp;</P>
<P>U:&nbsp; is a mapped drive to a shared directory on the same machine (it is mapped so that it can be moved without configuration changes)</P>
<P>Any guidance as to what I'm doing wrong would be gratefully received.</P>
<P>Thanks in hopeful anticipation</P>
