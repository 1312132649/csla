Unfortunately any string with a more that one word will returrn positive, i.e., the rule is broken.&nbsp; Here is the code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool result = string.IsNullOrEmpty(ce.Name) ||<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !(from c in ce.Name.ToCharArray()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where !char.IsLetter(c)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select c)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Any();</p>
<p>It appears that char.IsLetter() considers a space a number.&nbsp; For example, Good Morning returns a broken rule.&nbsp; My C# book says char.IsLetter considers only&nbsp;A-Z and a-z as letters, so that will exclude commas, periods, semicolons, etc&nbsp;also&nbsp;from the &quot;Letter&quot; category.&nbsp;char.IsDigit (positive if 0-9)&nbsp;might be a better test.</p>

Of course the sample isn&#39;t intended to have a great rule for detecting numerics - just to show how to build sync/async rules :)</p>
<p>Fortunately I&#39;m messing with that sample at the moment though (enhancing it for a talk I&#39;m giving at the <em>Visual Studio Live!</em> conference), so I&#39;ll see about making this change.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Wednesday, August 04, 2010</h2><p>It came about when I entered O&#39;Donnel in the name box.&nbsp; With the old style rules, I wouldn&#39;t have given it a second thought.&nbsp; I was so impressed with the new rule system as I was trying to dissect it to see how it worked, and what exactly was causing the error.&nbsp; It was my own surprize in discovering that a space character is not considered a letter that I felt I should share it.</p>
<p>Of course the name of the rule is StringOnlyLetters, so technically char.IsLetter is not the &quot;wrong&quot; test in the rule. <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>
