I clicked on the "Forgot password link" but have not yet received <br />an email with a new password (or instructions on getting one).  So now I <br />am unable to post any messages on the forum.  Could you help me out, please?<br /><br />thanks!<br /><br />-- <br /><br />Frank.<br /><br />Frank Cazabon<br />Samaan Systems Ltd. - Developing Solutions<br />www.SamaanSystems.com/<br /><br />Referrals are important to us. <br />If you know of anyone who would benefit from our services, please contact me.

at least one good thing came out of this: I learnt that I can send an email to the forum and it gets posted here!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
