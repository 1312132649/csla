<P>Does anyon know if the CSLA databinding would be supported by MS's DataGridViewAutoFilter library? Or has anyone managed to incorporate it into a csla-solution?</P>
<P>I have tried to implement as per the MS article, but am unable to enable the autofilter features in properties and subsequently unable to even see the autofilter dropdowns in the windows designer.</P>
<P>This is the microsoft blurb.</P>
<P>Any ideas/comments/suggestions?</P>
<P>Many thanks,</P>

<P>Here's the blurb link...</P>
