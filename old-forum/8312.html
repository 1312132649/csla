I've got an geosciences application with GIS (GIS in beta release) running amongst 40+ users country-wide within my customer's WAN for just over a year now, handling access to 40 million+ records.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Firstly, "Rocky, thank you very much for the vision,&nbsp;the time, the effort, the drive and confidence and especially, <STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>those books</FONT></STRONG>!!" Being in this industry myself for almost 14 years I know there would have been hard times, dark times, lack of family responsibility, and some added words in your vocabulary. Thanks for everything.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Secondly, thank to all forumites with your posts, titbits and comments, from which I've learned everything there is to know about CSLA, software and life.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>From this month I'll be venturing into the little unknown (for me) world of Linq, Silverlight, ASP.NET 3.5, accompanying with my ever trusted CSLA assembly. I'll be starting with 3.6.0, to get the grips and work my way up. I can't wait...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Regards</FONT></P>

Since silveright 3 that is, but now silverlight 4 is around it's even better!<br /><br />All i want to say: Have fun :)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, January 08, 2010</h2><P>Thank you for your kind words and thoughts Casper, I appreciate them very much.</P>
<P>Best of luck as you explore Silverlight. For my part, I haven't had so much fun programming for many years as I have with Silverlight, and I hope you have a similar experience.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
