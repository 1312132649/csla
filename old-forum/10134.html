None of them <em>expect</em> that properties will exist on a list or collection, so they have no provision for interacting with those properties.</p>
<p>XAML is the first exception to this rule, and even in this case none of the <em>default</em> behaviors for interacting with lists or collections assume properties will exist.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
