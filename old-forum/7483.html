It looks to me like it would have been more appropriate to have declared this function an instance function rather than static but that just me. <br /><br />I do realize that it does not really matter if the function was declared as static or instance and that it’s a matter of preference but I can’t help being curious about what was the train of thought that lead to making this function a static one rather than instance.<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 24, 2009</h2><P>I don't recall the exact thought process, that was a long time ago :)</P>
<P>I suspect my thinking was that the method might be useful in other scenarios and making it static would make it more broadly accessible - but that's just guessing at this point.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Thursday, October 29, 2009</h2>Since we have been talking about refactoring, please keep this post in mind. <br /><br />I think changing the GetPropertyName() function to an instance method would be harmless and it would be incredibly easy for people to fix in their own code.<br /><br />Why fix it when is not really a must?? Well, because I think is the right thing to do of course :)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
