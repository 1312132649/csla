To verify just paste your URL from ServiceReferences.ClientConfig into a browser and see if you get any errors, or a standard WCF page will come up.  I suspect eh issue is that IIS 5 has no idea about WCF.

(3.0.0.0) but vs will only let me reference (2.0.5.0) from the silverlight project. dont know if this problem is related or not. in this new sl project i then added a service reference to the wcf service in iis and vs able to find it.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sergeyb replied on Thursday, July 09, 2009</h2>You do not need to add a reference, CSLA does that for you.  If your SVC page comes up, service is alive and well.  Next step is to call it from sivlerlight app and see what error comes back.  Make sure to check the url in .ClientConfig to ensure it is correct.<br /><br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: germie [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Thursday, July 09, 2009 11:07 AM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] RE: silverlight deployment<br /><br />when i paste the url into the browser i do get the "you have created a service page". i even ran the svcutil.exe to get the generated client class. then i tried to add them to a project. the code tried to reference system.runtime.serialization...

You do not need any service references either.
