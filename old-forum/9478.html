<p>I now want to filter my ReportsView based on the selected item in the GroupsView.&nbsp;I&#39;m guessing that I need the GroupsView to set a property on my ReportsViewModel which can then call a ReportsList changed event on the model to trigger the filter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(My ReportsViewModel follows the SlDemo EmployeeItemListViewModel and EmployeeItemViewModel which uses a Public observablecollection(of EmployeeItemViewModel) to bind to).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, September 08, 2010</h2><p>You are using Bxf - so LeftContent and RightContent are separate usercontrol objects?</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t approach the problem that way - it makes more work for you.</p>
<p>It is better to keep master-detail elements in a single usercontrol, because then data binding will do all the work for you.</p>
<p>When the user selects an item on the left, it will automatically restrict the detail list (on the right) to the selected item&#39;s details.</p>
<p>If you are spanning usercontrol objects, this gets much more complex - because you assume the responsibility for coordinating across the views and viewmodels instead of letting data binding do all the work for you...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>c_manboy replied on Thursday, September 09, 2010</h2><p>My Report object contains Name, Group, Frequency properties.&nbsp; Where I&#39;m struggling is in how to implement grouping on the collectionviewsource and display the groupdescriptions in listbox1 and subsequently filter listbox2 showing the reports in that groupdescription.</p>
<p>At the moment I got it to work with two user controls using TriggerAction.&nbsp; LeftPanel displays the groups in a listbox&nbsp;from a BLB object with a TriggerAction on each listitem.&nbsp; The TriggerAction then populates RightPanel with the Reports for that group.&nbsp; I overloaded my factory method to accept a parameter to fetch the reports in that group.&nbsp; The downside to this approach is that I&#39;d like the user be able to determine the group, either by Group or by Frequency, which suggests that if I could make it work with a collectionviewsource then it&#39;d be easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MVVM pattern is starting to click for me, so I think I can come up with single UC solution soon enough.</p>
<p>Thanks Rocky.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
