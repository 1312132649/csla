<P>I'm wondering whether anyone has written any forms for security maintenance? And would they be willing to post them in the forum? Add new User, Delete User, Add Role to User, Delete Role from User, Add Role, Delete Role, Change User Password. </P>
<P>They have some nice controls for web forms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cheers</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
