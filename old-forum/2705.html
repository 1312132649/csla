<P>I am running a hosted system that uses a smart client and IIS as the host for my data portal.&nbsp; I currently have about 200 clients, each with their own client ID to identify them on the backend and each with their own database, etc..</P>
<P>I use the client context to store the user's client ID, passing in the information from the client to the server using the build in client context in CSLA to determine which database to work with.&nbsp; I am finding more and more commonly that the client ID is nothing - the threadslot is cleared or not set, I dont' know.&nbsp; I have been using windows security up to this point.</P>
<P>Has anybody had any problems with the client context?&nbsp; I don't believe my system is under tremendous stress.&nbsp; I am seeing about 1000 requests/minute on 2 web servers for the client application, and about another 500 requests/minute for a web service on the same servers.</P>
<P>I would appreciate any help.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Alex.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 16, 2007</h2><P>What version of CSLA? There were some issues with older versions of the framework, and they were resolved by NOT using the thread for storage under ASP.NET, but instead using slots in HttpContext.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
