Looking at CSLA, Composite UI Block, and Smart Client Factory, I don't see a full implementation of the MVC "command" pattern. I want a deep undo/redo command stack, which requires a command class with an undo method. I can't believe they would write the Composite UI Block without this since they specify their design as MVC. Perhaps I have missed something here. Does anyone here have a solution for this? I am looking at having to port some of my old c++ code over to c# to get what I want.
