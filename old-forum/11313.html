<p>my consultant advised me to use a code generator for CSLA.<br />He uses an older version of sculpture which is not current with VS2010 and CSLA4.</p>
<p>My research showed me that sculpture initially was a codeplex project on <a href="http://sculpture.codeplex.com/">http://sculpture.codeplex.com/</a><br />This version 1.0 is very outdated.</p>
<p>Next it moved to <a href="http://www.dawliasoft.com/">http://www.dawliasoft.com/</a>&nbsp;(which does not exist any more) and evolved to v2.x there.<br />This version is in use by my consultant.</p>
<p>Currently the project is developed by a company called ModelingSoft at <a href="http://www.modelingsoft.com/">http://www.modelingsoft.com/</a>&nbsp;.<br />Surprisingly I cannot find any hint to CSLA there. More confusing there are several similar but different products available.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain to me what I need for developing CSLA 4 Business classes with a current sculpture within VS2010 ?<br />If not, which other product enables me to visually design the business layer while keeping me able to highly customize the generation process and the resulting generated code?</p>
<p>thanks, Alexander.</p>

<p>the best options I know of is:</p>
<ul>
<li>CodeComplete, Commercial, <a href="http://eurowisesoft.com">http://eurowisesoft.com</a> with T4 based templates.</li>
<li>CodeSmith, Commercial, <a href="http://codesmithtools.com">http://codesmithtools.com</a> with codesmith templates.</li>
<li>CslaGenFork, OpenSource, <a href="http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com">http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com</a> with codesmith templates (last free codsmith version 2.6 used for generation)</li>
</ul>
<p>All support CSLA 4 and&nbsp;have been released recently. <br />Download the trial version/full version&nbsp;and test them to see which product fits best for your needs. </p>
<p>And please post your findings to us. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bniemyjski replied on Wednesday, April 18, 2012</h2><p>I&#39;d recommend taking a look at the CodeSmith templates. We are awaiting to release the latest version of the templates that support views and stored procedures.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mesloub replied on Thursday, April 19, 2012</h2><p><span lang="EN-US">I have been evaluating the latest version of Code Complete and&nbsp;</span>
their new modeling tool it looks very promising. You can model both the entity
model and the domain model and it &nbsp;supports the CSLA.Net stereotypes very
well. &nbsp;The use of T4 templates is a big +
for me.</p>
