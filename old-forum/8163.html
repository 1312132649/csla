CSLA is not a UI framework, it just has the minimum set of functionality to build a decent UI.</P>
<P>But you will find that the MVVM pattern itself says that the viewmodel doesn't reference the view. Such a reference would violate the pattern - so no reputable framework will support that concept, because it is not allowed by the pattern.</P>
<P>The idea is for the viewmodel to expose properties and methods, and to have the view bind to those properties and methods.</P>
<P>If the viewmodel has data that changes frequently, and the data should appear in the view, then the viewmodel should expose that data through properties and raise PropertyChanged when the data has changed.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
