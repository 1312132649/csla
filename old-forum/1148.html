I find the DevExpress notification icon is better than the standard .Net ErrorProvider because it resizes the control to make room for the icon instead of placing the icon outside the control.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2>I don't know DevExpress, but some Infragistics controls have an option you have to set for the control to handle IDataError interface events.&nbsp; Perhaps DevExpress controls have such an option?<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
