Every project has list of  Policies that belong only to him and list of TraceTypes that belong to this project.<br />Every TraceType in addition to his own properties has on additional property that references to some Policy from project.<br />Class diagram will be  like:<br /><br />Policy { Id: int,Name: string , Data: string}<br />TraceType { Id: int, Name : int, DefaultPolicy : Policy}<br />Project { Id: int, Name: string, Polices : list of Policy, TraceTypes : list of TraceType}<br /><br />I have an use case where user should be able to open the project for edit and to do the following operations:<br />  1) add/remove/update policy<br />  2) change policy assignment to TraceType.<br />The use-case can not be split to 2 use-cases like add/delete/update Policy and change policy assignment to TraceType.<br /><br />How I can define the Policy object that can be attached to several parents (policies list and one of more trace types)? <br /><br />Thanks,<br /> Dima</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
