<P>Additionally, version 2.1.3 of CSLA .NET is now available for download from <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx"><FONT color=#99aa99>this location</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>Version 2.1.3 includes some bug fixes and minor enhancements. The enhancements are primarily around the CslaDataSource web control, which now provides more integrated support for paging and sorting.</P>
<P>Most importantly, version 2.1.3 is the specific version described in my <EM>CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</EM>. I am releasing this as a ~160 page&nbsp;ebook, available in editions for both C# and VB, for purchase directly from my web site. </P>
<P>This&nbsp;new book is best thought of as a sequel to my my <EM>Expert C# 2005 Business Objects </EM>and <EM>Expert VB 2005 Business Objects </EM>books. It covers the changes made since CSLA .NET 2.0 was released: how the framework has changed, and how to use the new features and capabilities. Please note that this <EM>is not a replacement</EM> for those books: it expands on them.</P>
<P>I hope you enjoy CSLA .NET 2.1.3, and the new book. Thank you, code well, have fun!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CaymanIslandsCarpediem replied on Wednesday, January 31, 2007</h2><P>Great!&nbsp; Just got the C# book, thx!</P>
<P>FYI, I'm from the Cayman Islands (Grand Cayman) but it charged me tax on the purchase.&nbsp; I couldn't care less about the extra $1.54, but just thought I'd let you know as I'm guessing the store isn't meant to do that unless I'm located in the same state as you.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Just an FYI, please don't try to refund or anything like that.&nbsp; </P>
