<p>We have done a little of our own research on the products currently offered. But&nbsp;no&nbsp;verbage from the vendors would interest us as much as <strong>your </strong>comments&nbsp;about your&nbsp;<strong>experience </strong>with them.</p>
<p>So, who among you likes the features, value and support of their licensing software.... or wants to warn us to avoid it???</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
