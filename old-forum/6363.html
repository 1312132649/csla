The added benefit I see would be that the re-curring questions or themes could be addressed and hopefully reduce your forum support burden with more time for R&amp;D.....I mean more time with your family...<img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />)<br><br>By the way, as an aside, the default filter for the current FAQ forum only shows posts newer than 2 months (which means you currently get a '<img align="absmiddle">Oops! There are either no posts or due to a filter there are no posts to display.'). Perhaps this should be set to automatically show all posts ?</font><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, February 08, 2009</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Yeah, the use of the forum for a FAQ list didn&#8217;t work
well. The idea was that other people could maintain the FAQ &#8211; and that
part is good. But the forum software doesn&#8217;t have a way to override the
filter so the posts are always visible </span><span>L</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I&#8217;m open to revisiting the FAQ idea where a limited number
of motivated people maintain the FAQ. But I think I&#8217;d do it by setting up
a location on <a href="http://www.lhotka.net">www.lhotka.net</a> (probably with
a read-only wiki) so the FAQ team could edit the content, the world could see
the content and spammers couldn&#8217;t mess it up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<P>What is needed now are people willing to create and maintain the content - and probably provide some organizational scheme.</P>
<P>You'll notice that I organized things a little, but already it is clear that further subdivision (and consolidation) is probably required to make the information useful.</P>
<P>Of course a ton of existing content exists on <A href="http://www.lhotka.net">www.lhotka.net</A>, and I surely don't want to duplicate that. So one important element will be to identify and link to existing content whereever possible, and to only create new content if necessary.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
