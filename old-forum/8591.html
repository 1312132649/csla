<p>The WindowsPrincipal is null / nothing so is failing to cast.&nbsp; While they have been able to access the application in the past, suddenly they can&#39;t seem to logon anymore.&nbsp; .Net seems unable to populate the WindowsPrincipal object.</p>
<p>If I log on to their machine, I can run the application fine.&nbsp; And if they logon to another machine they can run it too.&nbsp; Seems to be something has gone wrong on their PC jsut for their logon.&nbsp; Weird.</p>
<p>Though I&#39;d post here as this is where the best of the best hang out, hoping that flattery works.<br />Googling hasn&#39;t thrown up any other solutions.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>richardb replied on Monday, March 01, 2010</h2><p>Ah the problem seems to be corrupt Windows profile.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know why, but recreating it fixed the problem.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
