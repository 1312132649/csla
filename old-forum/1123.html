of the importance of "normalisation of behaviour" - does anyone know of any good sites or texts on 
this vital-sounding topic?&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Too many of us map tables to objects and suffer the 
consequences!<br>

You can find material about these concepts on the web, and also from authors such as David Taylor and David West.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rhoeting replied on Wednesday, September 06, 2006</h2>I think the "normalization of behavior" idea is brilliant.&nbsp; It resonated the moment I read it...&nbsp; It greatly helps make the mental distiction between data modeling and object modeling.&nbsp; <br><br>Slightly OT, but I now wonder if we can apply this to SOA and "Service Modeling":<br><br>Data Modeling --&gt;&nbsp; Normalization of Data<br>Object Modeling --&gt; Normalization of Behavior<br>Service Modeling --&gt; Normalization of Process<br><br>Do folks think the last statement is accurate?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why or Why not?<br><br>Rob<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>malloc1024 replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2><p class="MsoNormal">Normalizing behavior is not new and has been around for awhile.<span>&nbsp; </span>It should be easy to find information on this
topic.<span>&nbsp; </span>I did find a good article that
describes class normalization.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is
like data normalization except that you normalize the behavior in classes.<span>&nbsp; </span>A class can be in First Object Normal Form, Second
Object Normal Form or Third Object Normal Form.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Ideally, you would like your class to be in Third Object Normal
Form.<span>&nbsp; </span>These steps are very simple to
follow. <span>&nbsp;</span>This article is very helpful and
informative.</p>

"Agile Database Techniques". As ever, I expect you learn better by
doing than by reading, but it should be a useful guide,<br>

that, If you follows a correct way of creating Use Cases, Sequences and
Collaboration Diagrams, your final Class diagram or Business Objects Model,
should not be in less than 3ONF, because of you were able to identify correctly
the Business Objects with a normalization of behavior, from that potential ones,
due to the collaborations between them.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>malloc1024 replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Of course all that theory is inside

</span>That is why I recommended it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That article is for those that are coming from a data-centric view.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will be old hat for those that have
mastered OOD.<span>&nbsp; </span>You should learn the
basics of OOP along with the principles.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The aforementioned article mentions this as well.&nbsp; This will help you more than anything.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can know how to create Use Cases, Sequences and Collaboration
Diagrams and still be unable to create a good design without knowing the OOP
basics and principles.<o:p><br>
