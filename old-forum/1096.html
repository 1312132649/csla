If I remove a child object and then clone the entire bo, the deleted childe has the IsNew property set to true. This means that doing a save will not delete the supposedly deleted child.<br><br>The reason that I was trying this is that doing a remove of the child on the original bo followed by an applyEdit() and a Save() never triggers the delete logic because the EditLevelAdded and the EditLevel are both 0.<br><br>This bo is bound to a binding source and a devexp grid.<br><br>Any thoughts on how to resolve either or both of these issues?<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
