We are using CSLA 4 and are trying to implement a &quot;Range&quot; rule that&nbsp; basically checks that the property falls between a range of numbers.<br /><br />The issue is that one of our properties needs to be checked against two ranges, so we add the rule to the property twice.&nbsp; It seems like when we add the rule twice only one of the rules ends up being applied to the property. </p>
<p>Is there a recommended way to do this?</p>
<p>Thank you</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
