In my aspx.cs page i am calling say category.save. This goes to the DataPortal_Insert and saves the record and the procedure returns a value which says whether the insert was successful or not. This value is not returned back to the aspx.cs page. So how could i return this value to the front so that i could check its value and say whether the save was succesful or not?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Not sure what your problem is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The return value should be part of the business object and you must also remember that Save returns a new object.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IE:</p>
<p>savedCategory = category.Save();<br />saveOK = savedCategory.ResultCode == 0;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
