<p>I suspect not, since CSLA isn&#39;t necessarily open-source in a pure sense. It is owned by Marimer LLC, and made available for use under a liberal license. This license allows the use of the framework to build software for which you charge money for purchase, distribution, etc.</p>
<p>The most likely reason for Microsoft&#39;s license restriction isn&#39;t the conspiracy theory in that article, but rather that Microsoft takes money for distributing software through the Zune store. If part or all of the license for someone&#39;s software prevents legal distribution of software in exchange for money, then Microsoft would be legally liable.</p>
<p>It would then get very murky to say &quot;well, the customer only paid for the non-LGP parts of the download, not the LGPL parts&quot;. How would that work when the customer paid $2.99 and downloaded one set of code that includes both legal and (now) illegal bits.</p>
<p>If Microsoft were to deny the use of CSLA on the phone I&#39;d have to change my license. But I doubt that will be necessary since the CSLA license doens&#39;t preclude the use of the framework in commercial apps or the distribution of commercial apps.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
