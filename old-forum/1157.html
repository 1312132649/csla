Am I missing something?<br><br>Also is there a reason that some test classes (i.e. TransactionalRoot) do not use the app config for the DB connection string?<br><br>Thanks.<br>Andrew<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dean replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2>The sortedbindinglist indexof function had a bug which is fixed in v2.1. In earlier version's it returns the unsorted index. I haven't looked at the test you are referring to but that is probably it.<br><br>Dean<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2>That was because there is a bug in IndexOf() in 2.0.3, and the person writing the test must have assumed IndexOf was working correctly, rather than writing the test to find the bug.<br><br>In 2.1 both the IndexOf() bug and the test are fixed.<br><br>There are a lot of inconsistencies in the tests, because they were written by no less than 5 people with varying levels of experience in .NET and/or CSLA. I have no doubt that now, after gaining months of experience, the same people would do a different, and probably better, job. But I was happy to have a set of resources at all, because I'd never have had the time to write all the tests that exist and still get the framework and book out in a timely manner.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
