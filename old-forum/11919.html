<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a long while since I last setup PT, and I&#39;ve had a hunt for some recent instruction and come up empty.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m hoping someone could enlighten me. I have just download the latest code from git and I have all the databases too. Nothing fancy, just winform connecting to database.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>The 4.5 code is mostly the same, but it uses the new async/await features for the data portal. Those changes are pretty minor in the scheme of things, so the &#39;Using CSLA 4&#39; books are still relevant.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Friday, April 05, 2013</h2><p>Hi Rocky</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to answer, read those some time and touched CSLA since as the company I work for now have no coding standards yet. They are trying to move in that direction, but getting the work out the door is more important. :(</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to try again and suggest CSLA!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
