<P>Without saying it is simple or not, but is it as straightforward as implementing the appropriate CSLA interfaces on top of a different algorithm?&nbsp; (IIndex ?).&nbsp; I know Aaron did all the existing work in his free time so I was curious where things sat.</P>
<P>There is a gentleman from the MS Silverlight team who released an implementation of a Left Leaning RedBlack tree that is used in the WPF/Silverlight Data Visualization toolkit for charting.</P>
<P>C1 components is also toting a LiveLinq product (not yet Silverlight) that looks very similar to CSLA LinqBindingList.</P>
<P>I'm finding more and more I'm using LINQ and I think I could really improve my application and DAL by reading in simpler data sets and using LINQ to provide more views to the application.&nbsp; The InventoryDemo really opened my eyes to almost having a 2 stage DAL with LINQ to CSLA sitting on top of my Oracle implementation.&nbsp; Anyhow having indexing at the client would obviously dramatically improve on that.</P>
