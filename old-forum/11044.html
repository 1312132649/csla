<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m new in the .NET world. I studied C# for a bit more than one
year and now I&rsquo;d like to develop a simple application in order to learn it in practice.
I heard about CSLA and it looks great, but I find a bit difficult to start it by
myself, so that I&rsquo;m here to ask if anyone knows any CSL training in London or
anyone that would be interested in giving me training? I will be paying for it.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry if my question is not appropriate in this forum, but as I
don&rsquo;t know anyone who knows CSLA I found appropriated to ask here.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers</span></p>
<p><span>Joaber</span></p>

<p>Sorry stumbled across this when looking for something else. Just had to reply.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t go near CSLA for .NET would be my advice. Rocky Lhotka is great salesman especially at claiming Microsoft .NET improvements as his own. The framework was impressive for something written in VB6 but poor and very restrictive for .NET. I&#39;ve worked on a project using CSLA and spent more time working around problems caused by the framework or fixing the framework than writing the actual application.</p>
<p>Would suggest you stay well clear of this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

And this is several applications within a very large bank and up to near 40 developer at peak.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a steep learning curve and I do recommend the Using CSLA 4 Ebooks as they focus on how to use the framework.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I do know other projects that did not understand what CSLA is supposed to do and these have struggeled or turned to other frameworks (like trying to use CSLA as &nbsp;ORM). Still, for what is intended for in LOB applications I believe it is a really good and productive framework.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>chrduf replied on Tuesday, July 31, 2012</h2><p>We have been using CSLA for the past 3 years with a large enterprise webform application and found it to be very solid. We have done extensive load testing at our lab and Microsoft&#39;s lab and have found no significant problems with the framework. </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
