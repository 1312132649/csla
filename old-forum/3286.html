<P>ie. High Level User has access to all</P>
<P>Medium Level will have access to what the High Level User deems appropriate. on an object by object basis.</P>
<P>Low Level will also have the access given by the High Level User.</P>
<P>I was thinking of having a grid of the sections and stating the minimum level required to access. L, M&nbsp; or H.&nbsp; The idea I had was an algorithm eg. UL 3&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; 2 Minimum </P>
<P>This will be set by the users. But how to code the business objects for this variable arrangement.</P>
<P>Any suggestions welcomed</P>

The methods called in that method are string based, specifically so you can easily make that code data-driven.</P>
<P>In other words, you can store the object-role metadata in a database, and then use that metadata in AddAuthorizationRules() to specify the roles that can act on each of your objects and their properties.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
