I would like to add Rules to this collection and then merge it with the business objects BrokenRulesCollection class.</P>
<P>I can not see how to&nbsp;create and add&nbsp;a BrokenRule object to this custom collection class.</P>
<P>Perhaps this was not the intention on how to use this BrokenRulesCollection object?</P>

Specifically to allow someone to create a "master list" for an object graph.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
