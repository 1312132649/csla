<p>While I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll readjust, I would say that one thing I did like seeing is the list of your blog posts plus recent CSLA forum posts on the right side of that screen.</p>
<p>Again, I&#39;ll readjust - but that&#39;s just something that I know I found personally nice about the old lhotka.net that is no longer there.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your hard work - I&#39;ll be in Vegas for VS Live and am making a point to make it to one of your sessions.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pcanada replied on Monday, March 25, 2013</h2><p>Same here. As soon as the page loaded, my eyes would go right to the blog posts and forum posts to see what was new.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mbblum replied on Tuesday, March 26, 2013</h2><p>Likewise, I have come via the lhotka.net and looked to the blog and forum post lists. </p>
<p>The minimum is to add a link in the list on the new home page&nbsp;to the forums, and&nbsp;in particular the CSLA.Net&nbsp;Discussion forum for support questions. </p>
<p>My thank&#39;s also.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 27, 2013</h2><p>I appreciate the feedback - thanks all!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
