The app requires the ability to save output to many different format XML files as well as many different DB server types. Each XML file represents a single transaction which includes a host of traditional data as well as external documents encrypted into it. The XML files are the desired output from the program, the databases are just used for reporting purposes and may not be available all the time and will only contain a subset of the data that is in the XML file. </FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>The UI is in WPF, my BO’s are CSLA 3.0. I want to have my BO’s write to a dataset in the business layer, then when requested pass the dataset to my persistence layer to save to my output to the&nbsp;different&nbsp;types. Using&nbsp;a dataset to pass betweenlayers&nbsp;also allows me to save and load the data locally in the disconnected scenario.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>The problem occurs in that I haven’t found any examples of CSLA apps being architected this way, specifically the BO’s writing directly to a dataset, they only seem to write to a database. My second question is am I better off writing a wrapper class that contains my root BO and the code to load and save the dataset or should I include the load and save the dataset logic in my root BO.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>Hope this makes sense. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</FONT></P>
