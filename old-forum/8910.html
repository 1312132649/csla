<p>I am just starting out with CSLA so the more working samples the better. I know Rocky said the samples will be updated during the beta cycle but if someone out there has already converted it that would be great.</p>
<p>I did get InventoryDemo to compile and deploy with no problem so that has been very helpful.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 11, 2010</h2><p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve gotten to Rolodex yet in the update process...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
