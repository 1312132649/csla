I have a few forms woking with my business objects. I am building some form functionality that I would like to propagate to others forms via visual inheritance.&nbsp; Some candidates for VI include&nbsp;an incremental search that I built and the ErrorProvider control that I&nbsp;have already&nbsp;added to&nbsp;3 forms. &nbsp;My question is: </P>
<P>Is it a good design choice to add all my form&nbsp;features I want to share&nbsp;to WinPart.vb since most of my forms are already inherit from the WinPart base control? Any advice is appreciated.</P>

However we use baseEditForm for virtual functions and common properties and methods. We do not put common components on our base edit form though because they are specific to the datasources that are on each instance of the child form</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
