<p>Some background on my skillset- I&#39;ve been using Winforms forever, CSLA since 1.51.&nbsp; I also have some experience in WPF, so XAML won&#39;t be entirely new to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#39;SimpleApp&#39; looks to be a decent bare-bones app, what would really be useful, though, is a walkthrough for creating an app like this (so I know what project types each of the 4 projects are), and some background as to why things are broken out the way they are (which is more on the Silverlight learning curve, I guess</p>
<p>Is such a walkthrough covered in the videos? Or one of the available e-Books?</p>
<p>I started with a Silverlight walkthrough app that didn&#39;t use CSLA, it seemed like I was going to have to throw out most of what I learned, though when I brought CSLA into the picture, so now I&#39;m seeing if there&#39;s a resource that will step me through it all at once.</p>
<p>thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, March 24, 2011</h2><p>Here&#39;s my recommendation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at SimpleApp - it is simple :)</li>
<li>Look at Samples\Net\cs\SimpleNTier - it is slightly less simple, but has a nice n-tier Silverlight implementation</li>
<li>Get the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series - it currently provides good information about creating the business classes (book 2)&nbsp;and the data access (book 3) - and I&#39;m rapidly completing the data portal book (book 4)</li>
<li>Also get the <em>CSLA 4 MVVM video series</em>, because it provides good information on how to create the Silverlight UI and bind it to the business objects - until book 5 of the ebook series comes out, this is the best info on creating a Silverlight UI over CSLA objects</li>
</ol>
