<P>Then I learned how to do sorting and added that to the code-behind page.</P>
<P>Everything runs fine.</P>
<P>But, I went into the designer and the GridView won't render properly in the designer.</P>
<P>I believe it has to do with the fact that the Select routine now returns a SortedBindingList&lt;ThingInfo&gt; instead of a ThingInfoList.</P>
<P>Here's the text that shows up in the rendered GridView in the designer:</P>
<P><EM>There was an error rendering the control.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Unable to cast transparent proxy to type 'Csla.Web.Design.TypeLoader.</EM></P>

That exception almost certainly indicates that VS is using a different version of CSLA from your project... This can happen if you update your CSLA version (like running through the various versions of 2.1 or something).<br><br>What you need to is the following (or some subset - but this is what I do):<br><ol><li>Remove ALL Csla.dll items from your toolbox in VS</li><li>Do a Rebuild All of your solution</li><li>Close all designers in VS<br></li><li>Close VS</li><li>Open VS</li><li>Open your solution</li><li>Add the current Csla.dll to your toolbox</li><li>Do a Rebuild All of your solution</li></ol>I'm guessing you don't really need to do all those steps - but I have found that doing this sequence of steps always gets VS and your project running the same version of Csla.dll.<br><br>I have to do this a lot, btw, because this is needed to switch between the VB and C# versions of Csla.dll as well... VS has no way to load an assembly of the same name at the same time, so I have to do this to switch between testing/developing with each version of the framework.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Sunday, August 27, 2006</h2>worked like a charm!&nbsp; thanks!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
