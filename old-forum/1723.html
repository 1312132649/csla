Just a short introductory post to say hello. I've used CSLA in the past with VB6 but I've not looked at it for a number of years. I've purchased the new C# book last week and re-discovered it again. It's a great framework! I've got a few projects coming up that I hope to take advantage of CSLA with. Looking forward to chatting with you all at some point.<br><br>Regards,<br>Gareth<br><br><br>Gareth Parris<br>Company Directory<br>Parris Technology Limited<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fabiousa7 replied on Thursday, November 09, 2006</h2><P>Welcome!</P>
