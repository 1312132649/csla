<p>I ask because I&#39;m trying to get Csla adopted here, especially on my team, because I think it would help us out quite a bit.&nbsp; Format training isn&#39;t an option for the team (some of the team is across the globe), and while I can say &quot;here are the ebooks we&#39;ll need&quot; that gets us to 4.0, and I&#39;m not sure how to get the last bit to 4.5.&nbsp; I assume there are new features, and while I know about the issue tracker, the descriptions there don&#39;t always go into why there is a change or what it means for users.</p>
<p>Is there newer documentation coming, or are things not as different as I&#39;m expecting, or is there a &quot;quick guide to new features of 4.5&quot; somewhere that goes into some depth about the features.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, July 26, 2013</h2><p>It&acute;s all valid in the CSLA 4.x books and it hasn&acute;t changed that much. Some updates has been done on the rule engine and these are described on my blog.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span>And of course the change log for each version.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span>The 4.5 release is primarily around support for .NET 4.5 with async and await possibilities in the DataPortal and Data Access. There is a few breaking changes and I believe these are marked as such in the change log.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, August 02, 2013</h2><p>Jonny is correct regarding the continued relevance of the current Ebooks. Andy is also correct, in that an updated ebook would generate much needed new sales to fund ongoing work on the framework.</p>
<p>My plan was to&nbsp;do a video series followed by an ebook update. As you are probably aware, I just had open chest surgery to replace a section of the aorta feeding out of my heart (yes, pretty much as fun as it sounds). At the moment a 10 minute walk makes me tired enough that I need a nap to recover, but that&#39;ll improve over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>My point is that my plan remains the same, but I don&#39;t expect to get a lot done over then next 8 to 12 weeks as I recover from surgery. Not that I&#39;m going to complain, because I&#39;m still here and that counts for a lot!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
