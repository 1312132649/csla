I need to modify the csla itself. When I open the solution it gives error:</P>
<P>Error reading key file c:\mykey.snk.</P>
<P>Dependancy dataportal can not be found.</P>
<P>I don't see this file within the project download. Where do I get it, as I assume this project must be signed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>thanks</P>

<P>So your organization must have its own key file - or some previous developer created one maybe?</P>
<P>There are instructions in the <EM>Business Objects</EM> book on how to create and use a key file if you can't find the one that was used in your organization in the past.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jhw replied on Monday, August 20, 2007</h2><P>I went ahead and generated my own key. </P>
