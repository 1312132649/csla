<P>I have a datagridview that has a datagridviewcombobox column. I fill this combo box using NameValueListBase. The problem I'm having is that when I run the application, and then change the item in the combo box (modify a value), the value goes back to the original value when I leave the cell. I"m able to modify the other columns. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</P>

The item that I selected changes back to the original item when I tab to the next field (column) in the datagridview, or when I click in another field in the datagridview.</P>
<P>Yes, I select an item from the combobox.</P>

<P>Not on every postback! Otherwise you keep re-setting the value.</P>

<P>I have a Windows form with a DataGridView which has a combobox column. It's this column that is giving me a problem. When I change the value, it resets when I tab out or when I click to another field. What causes it combo box to rest?</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

(mentioned in the previous response) is not relevant for datagridviews
as it only applies to simple controls.<br>

<P>To find a bag your Form.cs and Form.Designer.cs files are required.</P>
<P><STRONG>2 praevsky:</STRONG></P>
<P>Intresting. Can you show all four source files?<BR>Both old Form.cs and Form.Designer.cs which didn't work and new two.</P>
<P>Or you can just compare them youself and say&nbsp;to us are there any differencies.</P>
