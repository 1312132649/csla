<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>After reading your comment and realizing how true it is I am left a little dazed and confused. It has been acknowledged that remoting is not the best solution for remote business objects. In your book you spoke about the future support of WCF, yet you comment as follows about WCF not being a client/server protocal:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2><FONT color=#0000ff>"Microsoft move further and further from allowing their </FONT>SOA technologies (like web services or WCF) to provide support for what we think of as client/server"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>What options do we have left for client server? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This leads to a question about an application I am building now as a "next generation" business application. For the purposes of this question I will call the application "MX Word". Its a word processing application that understands how to talk to other instances of itself (SOA).<BR><BR>The following companies will all purchase this application:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Company A<BR>Company B<BR>Company C </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;The application is a smart client application allowing users from company A to create a word document and save it (from any click once enabled location). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Company B purchases the application because they are tired of&nbsp;getting paper copies of the MX Word documents from Company A. Now company A&nbsp;+ B both&nbsp;can update and mantain a single MX Word document (possibly hosted on both servers with replication updates sent between services).<BR><BR>When Company&nbsp;B edits&nbsp;the MX Word document the change is persisted to its local application and the remote instance of the MX Word application hosted by company A. (<FONT color=#ff0000>Q: Client/Server techologies to consider?</FONT>).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I could complicate it further by allowing company C to view and edit the document but you get the point.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In this world where&nbsp;document sharing passes the point of emailing attachments what happens to the lines between client/server tiers and&nbsp;SOA tiers?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Where&nbsp;would I look to find the approach to architect this kind of application? I was considering using an smtp based channel adapter as the protocal for communication between Company A and Company B. Effectivly making the BO&nbsp;the "message" in an&nbsp;SMTP based&nbsp;SOA.</FONT></P>

In other words, there's a relatively high level of semantic trust between the layers and thus between the tiers.<br><br>SOA is a model where you have n applications (services) - and these services are all logically independent of each other. In other words, there's little to no semantic trust between the services.<br><br>The real-world difference is that in n-tier client/server the goal is to minimize duplication of logic. If you validate or calculate a value in one layer, you try very hard not to revalidate or recalculate in some other layer. But in SO the services can not trust each other, and so if your service counts on a given value, it must validate or calculate that value - even if you know for a fact that it is also validated or calculated in some other service.<br><br>Obviously my wording there is a bit strong - but that's to get the though process rolling. Certainly it is the case that if you call a PricingService and it calculates a price, then other services won't recalculate that price as well. However, if that price is supposed to fall within certain parameters (it is a double, and must be greater than zero), every service that relies on that price should revalidate those parameters. <br><br>Why?<br><br>Because those services can't know what other services might have done to the price. Services are, by definition, decoupled. So if ServiceA calls PricingService and then passes the result to ServiceB, the fact is that ServiceB can't just assume that ServiceA didn't do something to the price value. Or that someone didn't use orchestration (through Biztalk or WF) to insert ServiceC between A and B - and then C could have altered the price in a bad way.<br><br>These issues, as a general rule, don't exist in client/server because there's this higher level of semantic trust (and also a higher level of coupling beween layers). But they absolutely exist in SO, because of the low level of semantic trust that is mandated by the lower levels of coupling.<br><br>The CSLA .NET data portal is very much an enabler of mobile objects. And mobile objects, by their very nature, are tightly coupled (you have the same objects on both sides of the network call - you can't get tighter coupling <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />). So the data portal is not a way of doing SO, and doesn't pretend to do so.<br><br>But if you read Chapter 11, you'll see that CSLA .NET does fit very nicely into an SO world. The reason is that you need to create those services - and CSLA is a great way (imo) to build services and applications that call services.<br><br>The data portal is absolutely a terrible idea between companies btw. The reason is that both companies would have to have the same DLL (same version even) on both sides. This level of cooperation between companies is almost unheard of, and isn't a constraint I'd want to impose on any enterpirse application integration (EAI) project. Message-based SO is a far superior model for EAI in my view, and so I'd recommend following that approach - very possibly creating both the services and the callers using CSLA - but passing neutral XML messages between them rather than serialized objects.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FireGarden replied on Monday, August 21, 2006</h2><P>Thanks Rocky.

<P>p.s. I have been meaning to send you a picture of my 2005 BO book. I preordered the book and received one of the first copies to find something peculiar.

reply - it is important to note that I wasn't commenting on WCF in specific. I 
don't think the technology itself is overly relevant other than that asmx and 
WCF make it easier to do message-based SO, and asmx makes it harder to do 
client/server. But WCF has good client/server support and there'll be a data 
portal channel for WCF early next year. There are some deeper changes required 
to CSLA .NET to make it completely support the DataContract concept though. 
Those changes will be part of that release as well.)</SPAN></FONT></SPAN></DIV>
