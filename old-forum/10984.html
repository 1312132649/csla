<p>However, I am struggling when it comes to understanding the way to test view Models in the Bxf framework. In the section &quot;Implementing a Mock Shell&quot; it concludes with the line &quot;With this MockShell class ready for use, all the remains is to tell Bxf to use it, and to handle the three Bxf events&quot; but I can find no reference to how to tell Bxf to use it. </p>
<p>I thought that the samples might give me a clue, so I looked that th Project Tracker project which has the test descrived in the ebook, but to no avail. I stepped though the test and&nbsp; found that the real Shell is used with the real View Factory, rather than the mocks. </p>
<p>I may well be being exstremely thick here, but can someone point me in the right direction. How should I best tell the Bxf framework to use the mock Shell?</p>
<p>Regards </p>

<p>The short answer is that your test initialization method needs to set Shell.Instance to an instance of the mock shell.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>simon_may replied on Monday, December 19, 2011</h2><p>Please accept my apologies Rocky for posting in the wrong forum.

<p>Did you ever figure this out?&nbsp; I&#39;ve got the CSLA MVVM video series (which rocks by the way) but I really need some help figuring out how to unit test my BXF view models.&nbsp; I post a question in the BXF forum last friday but havn&#39;t gotten a response.&nbsp; If anyone has some simple sample code of a SL/MVVM project with unit test code that would be greatly appreciated here.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
