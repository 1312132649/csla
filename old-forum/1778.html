I have a dependent rule that says if the IsSupervisor property = false that the SuperviorID must have a value.</P>
<P>The rule is the easy part, my problem is with the error provider. It's set on the employee binding source. In the form, I have a combo box (bound to a NVL) to populate supervisors. Because the combo is bound to a <SPAN>different </SPAN>object, the error provider won't register on the combo box which is where i want the error to display.</P>
<P>Anyone got a way around this?</P>
