This solves a longstanding issue for me of how to commit 2 (or more) root BOs in the same transaction (without using Enterprise Services or System.Transactions). I decided to continue passing the tr to contained child BOs as a parameter since all of my templates codegen that stuff anyway. I added some code to my base classes to support this scheme and modified my templates to build root BOs with this in mind. See the previous post for details.</P>
