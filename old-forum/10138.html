<p>Of larger concern is that I&#39;m pretty sure .NET won&#39;t run different versions of the framework in the same AppDomain.&nbsp; Given that the latest version targets .NET 4, while 1.5 targets 1.0 (or is it 1.1?), that presents a problem.&nbsp; You probably could re-compile 1.5 targeting .NET 4, but I don&#39;t know what might break, or work way differently than you expect it to.</p>
<p>Ultimately, all the work you will have to do just to get the two versions to co-exist is probably not worth it.&nbsp; You&#39;ll have to change so much of your BO code in the jump from 1.5 to 4 anyway that you&#39;re likely not saving yourself all that much (it&#39;s not so much a port as a re-write.)&nbsp; Trying to have some sort of &quot;bridge&quot; where you have code in both versions is likely going to be a nightmare to try and maintain, because the two frameworks do things so differently.</p>
