<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>It's old, but it should still apply.&nbsp; Basically, you can't use the DP because of the serialization restrictions in CF (which I assume still apply in .NET CF 2.0).&nbsp; That brings in some other issues, some of which are briefly discussed in that thread.&nbsp; There is also a link from someone who developed a CF-compatible version of CSLA.&nbsp; The only hitch is whether the author has kept up with CSLA versions - at the time of this thread, the author mentioned that the version of CSLA he converted was pre-CSLA 2.0.&nbsp; That's pretty old, and may be pre-VS 2005 as well.</FONT></P>

I based my code on CSLA.NET 3.0. &amp; CSLA.CE.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I have full undo edit and object serialisation betwean a Windows Mobile Client and a CSLA WebService. You can download a sample ProjectTracker for WM5 from 'http://unimetsolutions.com/links/business_applications.aspx'. The ProjectTracker sample is not a fully developed program but proves the concept of object serialisation betwean a WM5 Client and CSLA WebService</P>
<P>If you want to take this further please&nbsp;contact me.</P>

I expect the field manager and MobileFormatter in 3.6 would make a Compact Framework (CF) version substantially easier to work with now.<br /><br />In fact, I expect it would be possible to do what we did with the Silverlight version, and link a lot of the core .NET files directly into the CF project to improve maintainability.<br /><br />My _personal_ plan is to hold off for a few months to see how Microsoft's Silverlight for CE project pans out. If CSLA .NET for Silverlight can just work on mobile devices, that'd be my preference :)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sumit0501 replied on Monday, June 29, 2009</h2>Hi Teebs,<br><br>I tried to open your link but failed.<br>Can you please send me your sample to my personal email id at sumit0501@gmail.com<br><br>If possible.<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Teebs replied on Friday, July 10, 2009</h2>I've just finished re-writing CslaWm for CSLA 3.6.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 10, 2009</h2>

<P>But since I am actively using it I will definitely be maintaining the C# version (can't say for sure about a VB port although I do need to learn VB better)</P>
<P>For sure I need to make a Project Tracker CE.&nbsp; Some better documentation on the removed parts etc.<BR>Anyway just food for thought<BR></P>

Whatever documentation and samples are out there, well, that's all there is.</P>

<P>I built a "mobile app" using standard CSLA Business Objects. The "trick" I used was to make it a browser based app so that the mobile device used its built-in browser.</P>
<P>Then it was virtually a standard ASP.Net app except the screens used mobile controls. But the BOs were server side and the rendered html is fine for the app.</P>
