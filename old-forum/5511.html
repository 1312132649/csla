<P>I've writte an Application .NET 3.5 SP1 using Csla 2.1.4 + ActiveObjects 2.0, it runs from a network share, logs to a network share (seperate logfile per pc, using log4net).</P>
<P>Some users on the network can use the application just fine, other users can start the application but can't use it, data cannot be retrieved, the log-files tell me that there is a problem creating the ActiveObjects Dal object, wich is created using CreateInstance, I can't seem to figure out what's wrong here, since it works with some users and it also 'works on my machine :-)' I'd be tempted to say the program is just fine.</P>
<P>Those users who can use the app, can use it on all pc's, those who can't, can't use it on any pc.</P>
<P>Looking in the logfile indicates a problem in the GenericFactory class&nbsp;calling the 'create' method&nbsp;wich creates the object (obviously) and does that using Activator.CreateInstance</P>
<P>does this sound familiar to anyone out here ?<BR></P>
<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated...</P>

By default, the Intranet Zone imposes security restrictions on your code, meaning that many advanced features of .NET won't work - including lots of reflection stuff.</P>
<P>Activator.CreateInstance() is a reflection concept, and not all its options work when your code is in partial trust.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jurjen replied on Friday, October 03, 2008</h2><P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>Thanks Rocky, Iâ€™ll have to look into it again, I guess. </SPAN></P>
