<P>If I apply filter on the grid and then&nbsp;add child object to the DataSource BLB (not through grid interface) it does not show new&nbsp;element in the grid, even it conforms to filter.<BR>I&nbsp;have to reapply filter to show new object.</P>
<P>Everything work fine if grid does not have filter.</P>
<P>If I change DataSource object to BindingList&lt;MyBB&gt; with applied filter it works fine.</P>
<P>Only when DataSource is BLB&lt;MyBB&gt; and grid has filter it should not show new elements.</P>
<P>Am I missing something in my CSLA BLB classes? (they are pretty simple)</P>
