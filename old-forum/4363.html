In the latest book Rocky says we're using WCF because it's the latest thing from Microsoft but doesn't really give an opinion on if it's better, etc. i'm starting a new App and upgrading to .net 3.5 and csla 3.0 so i'm curious if the community has discovered any better way to go or if I should just charge ahead with WCF. Thanks all.<br><br>Byron<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, February 17, 2008</h2><P>There's no doubt in my mind that WCF is the superior option when compared to the others (remoting, asmx with WSE or enterprise services (dcom)).</P>

<P>I am researching on performance wcf vs asmx, what exactly did you mean by data portal?</P>
<P>Thanks!!</P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The data portal is a feature of CSLA .NET that manages
communication between the client and app server in a 3- or 4-tier physical
deployment, and allows transparent switching between 2- and 3-tier deployments with
no code changes. And it allows switching between various network transport
technologies such as WCF, Remoting, etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>It uses a combination of design patterns to do all this,
including channel adapter, provider, message router, gateway, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

Business Objects</i> book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<P>Sorry frankly I am not a CSLA user, I hope that is okay.&nbsp; I am just stumped with some performance result comparing asmx and wcf, was hoping wcf is much faster but the result show pretty much the same speed.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So with your original statement, does it mean without the data portal,&nbsp;wcf is slower than asmx, always?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 28, 2009</h2>






 





<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Not at all. WCF is probably comparable to asmx in most cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>But I personally haven&#8217;t done any testing of WCF vs asmx
outside the context of the data portal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>And the data portal does extra stuff that you wouldn&#8217;t
normally do with a message-based XML service, because the data portal requires
more functionality that you get with asmx or default WCF.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>In other words, the fact that the data portal has certain
performance characteristics <i>probably</i> doesn&#8217;t say much about
vanilla XML services performance, because XML services use a set of simpler
.NET technologies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<P>Guess i will have to continue researching why my speed test of wcf vs asmx is not as impressive as others have stated.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
