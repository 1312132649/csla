BusinessListBase know to mark their items a Children. There appears to be some confusion how to implement Child_Fetch. In the documentation some times it is passed a search criteria and some time it is passed a data transfer object. I do not see an example of implement Child_Fetch with a data factory implementation. Why not just call DataPortal.BeginFetch? Why write a readonly object to call DataPortal.FetchChild on the server?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, April 17, 2013</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>This also depends on how your application is configured. </p>
<p>BeginFetch may send the criteria over wire to another computer (N-tier) while ChildFetch will always run in-process. </p>
<p>If by data factory implemententation - you mean ObjectFactory implemententation, then you would/should never use DataPortal.FetchChild but rather call the corresponding ObjectFactory class to get the object. </p>
<p>A read-only object may be used as UnitOfWork (UoW) loader) - to load all the lists and objects required for a form. This is in particular nice for async loading of data and lists for a single screen - rather than have a number of async data portal calls and make sure to handle callbacks in the proper sequence (ex: databind all list for combobox&#39;es befor databinding the actual BO).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
