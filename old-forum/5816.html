<P>If I send a big collection back over the wire to the app server to be saved, cloned, and sent back, I really don't need&nbsp;the index rebuilt 3 times.&nbsp; I don't know what the actual time is to rebuild the indexes but it seems that unless you are doing more sorting/filtering etc on the server side that it is a waste of resources.</P>
<P>Am I missing something... or is that something that may be considered tweaking such that another opt-in/opt-out option?</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
