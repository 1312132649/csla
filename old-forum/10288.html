<p>Generally the license allows you to use CSLA.NET framework even in commercial applications.</p>
<p>After reading the <a title="license" href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/License.aspx">CSLA .NET license</a> I&#39;m not quite sure about one statement.</p>
<p>To be sure what does it mean? Specially for <b>European countries</b>?</p>
<p style="line-height:normal;margin:0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family:&#39;Courier New&#39;;">11. Governing Law.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-family:&#39;Courier New&#39;;">This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of Minnesota, USA.</span></p>
<p>Has anyone used CSLA.NET framework commercially in Europe? What about those laws?</p>
<p>Thanks for clarification of the license (asap).</p>

So one law must be elected above the others and usualy that&#39;s the law of the place where we are. By &quot;we&quot; I mean the people that wrote the clause, in this case Rocky / Marimer LLC. I guess Rocky leaves in Minnesota and his coprporation prefers to use the law from Minnesota.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, April 20, 2011</h2><p>That is correct. Legal contracts (including licenses) are all constructed according to some legal framework, and they must identify that framework. Because Marimer LLC is a Minnesota company, it makes sense that the license is based on that legal framework.</p>
<p>As I understand it (not being a lawyer), some terms have different meanings in different US states, much less different countries, and clearly the license can&#39;t be reinterpreted in each locale - the result would be chaos.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Miroslav Galajda replied on Thursday, April 21, 2011</h2><p>Thank you. So there is no &quot;catch question&quot;, so that a non-lawyer or even lawyer can&#39;t see?</p>
<p>Is that all about protecting you and Marimer LCC against any claims of warranty or something similar?</p>
<p>So, is it true, that I can use CSLA.NET in commercial application completely legally, in any country, except for I can&#39;t sell it&#39;s derivation as a framework, isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, April 21, 2011</h2>That is correct.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
