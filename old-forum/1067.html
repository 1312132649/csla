I've also got a datanavigator bound to bindingSource.list2<br><br>All the data retrieves and displays perfectly from the database. If I click the add button on the nav bar, the grid displays a new row and I can enter data into it. When I click the update on the nav\ bar, no data is sent to the database (IsDirty is false). I also get no saving even if I invoke the bo.Save() although if I don't bo.ApplyEdit() it complains that it can't save because an edit is in progress.<br><br>I've tried this with 3 different grids 3 different nav bars and 2 different binding sources but have not found a combination that will actually put data back into the database.<br><br>I am almost out of ideas about what to try next. Any help would be appreciated.<br><br>Dan<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tim FOrd replied on Wednesday, August 30, 2006</h2>Hi Dan,<br><br>I had the same issue, Check that you have overwritten the IsDirty etc function and verify your other business objects that relate. Also verify that MarkOld is being called in your dataportal fetch, this is dependant on your objects though.<br><br>Tim.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DanEssin replied on Wednesday, August 30, 2006</h2>I'll check.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /><br />Tim FOrd wrote:<br /><br />> Hi Dan,<br />><br />> I had the same issue, Check that you have overwritten the IsDirty etc <br />> function and verify your other business objects that relate.
