<p>On the BO I have a Required rule on a property and an async ObjectRule on the BO itself. Since one of the rules is async, I have to register on the BO.ValidationComplete event in my ViewModel so I can do something when it&#39;s done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course, in the continuation callback of my async rule I call context.Complete().&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the event is never raised. Is there something I&#39;m missing, or have I misunderstood the purpose of this event?&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dro replied on Tuesday, May 29, 2012</h2><p>Nevermind, I found the problem: I was cloning the object AFTER registering the event!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks anyways!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
