You don't do this in generic.xaml though - you do it in your app.xaml or other resource style sheet.</P>
<P>I'm pretty sure there's a sample showing how to do this in the Samples download.</P>
<P>The xaml isn't for the faint of heart, but then what xaml is? :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Charleh replied on Thursday, March 19, 2009</h2><P>I'm struggling to implement this, and I can't seem to find a good example of this in the samples. </P>
<P>I was trying to use a default style but it doesn't appear to want to parse my style resource files (gives me a XAML parse exception). I've got&nbsp;a WPF example of a numericupdown box working using a default style, but I can't get it working in Silverlight even after copying the style. I did&nbsp;read somewhere that you couldn't use default styles to style an element in Silverlight beta 2, has this feature been added to the release?</P>
<P>I want to be able to style all UI elements of a certain type such as the PropertyStatus and BusyAnimation controls, I just can't quite work out how to do it.</P>
<P>I've tried styles in app.xaml, generic.xaml, different syntax for the TargetType property for my style</P>
<P>e.g.</P>
<P>TargetType="csla:BusyAnimation"</P>
<P>or</P>
<P>TargetType="{x:Type csla:BusyAnimation}"</P>
<P>(second one throws the parse exceptions)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, March 19, 2009</h2><P>You are right - the sample I was thinking about is for WPF, not SL.</P>
<P>So I'm not entirely sure that you can replace the appearance in SL, because you can't change styles after they've been set - at least in SL 2. Hopefully SL 3 will make this easier/possible.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
