<p>This seems to create a bottleneck on a busy web site, when GetManager gets called from many threads at the same time. In this scenario I don&#39;t see a need for locking, as all requests are running on their own thread (read; having their own private LocalContext - HttpContext.Items).</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this issue?</p>

<p>That may be true. Making code perform thread safe may lead to some other side effects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may clone the CSLA code and make the required/proposed changes and test in your application. Then send a pull request of the changes to Rocky.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 09, 2014</h2><p>The trick will be to avoid the lock only in the case the code is running within an HttpContext.</p>
<p>I know for sure that when the code is running outside HttpContext and is using a static dictionary the lock is required. That is the case in most XAML-based runtimes.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
