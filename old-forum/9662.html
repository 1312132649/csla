<p>am I right in thinking this no longer exists in csla 4.?</p>
<p>If so, what has replaced it and is there any sample code (web page) available for me to look at.</p>
<p>(Looking for a quick response as am in the middle of development and need to sort.)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Web Forms hasn&#39;t changed in any substantial way for several years, and the data source model is still the primary way data is bound to a Web Forms UI.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll find CslaDataSource in the Csla.Web assembly/namespace.</p>
<p>The techniques described in the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/">CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</a> ebook remain valid. Again, Web Forms hasn&#39;t changed much over the years, which you can think of as being a good thing since it has remained consistent. I certainly think it is good, as I&#39;ve had to do very little work to support Web Forms over time :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>griff replied on Friday, October 22, 2010</h2><p>Many thanks for the quick reply.....yes you&#39;re right.... it still exists and my error was to look in the csla.dll namespace and not csla.web</p>
