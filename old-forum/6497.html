<P>I can get the objects when calling object.getXXX that works.</P>
<P>I also have a problem when i bind the cancel,save,delete buttons. The save and cancel button&nbsp;is enabled when there has been no changes.</P>
<P>I am using Rolodex and the RemotePortalWithObjectFactory projects to learn from. but I have&nbsp;not been able to find the difference in my own code and the code in RemotePortalWithObjectFactory.</P>
<P>I am using&nbsp;&nbsp;the ASP.NET development server and using the silverlight hosting website as the wcfhost to.</P>
<P>Hope someone can help me.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 25, 2009</h2><P>This typically means that the name of the type or method is wrong, so the reflection code to invoke the method fails to find the&nbsp;type/method (resulting in a null).</P>
<P>I'm trying to tighten up the exception messages to be more explicit, so this should get better over next next version or two - hopefully thus helping the debugging/troubleshooting process.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
