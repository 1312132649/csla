<p>When using the ActionExtender to perform the save operations for you and an error occurs, the object is not rebound to the BindingSource and therefore the ActionExtender essentially stops operating because the datasource is&nbsp;null.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve attached a sample which demostrates the problem very easily, enter the required information and then hit save and you will receive an error (data_portal_fetch), hit save again and you will get a different error. In theory you should keep getting the same error.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve looked at the code (CslaActionExtender.cs) and I think in the exception block it should be rebinding to savableObject like it would attempt to do if the save was complete and RendingAfterSave was true.</p>
<p>The references to CSLA are probably incorrect in the project, and apologies for that :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 15, 2010</h2><p>Sounds like a bug, I&#39;ve added it to the list.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
