<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pfeds replied on Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h2><P>I have been implementing an application using the Composite UI Application Block (CAB)&nbsp;very successfully with CSLA, so personally I can highly recommend it.&nbsp; The application is now 90% ready for release and I have no regrets using this architecture.</P>
<P>If you need any specific help then let me know.</P>
<P>Do it!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>nermin replied on Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h2><P>Definitely,</P>
<P>I am using it with the CAB in my current app, which shoulld be the base for the SC-SF templates.&nbsp; Two libraries complent each other well.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Chris replied on Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h2><P>pfeds, nermin,</P>
<P>I've been using CAB since March and I am now using CAB with CSLA.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Have either of you altered your business objects at all with CAB attributes (such as pub/sub or smartpart)?&nbsp; </P>
<P>CAB promotes the use of controllers that call services.&nbsp; So, did you put your BO's and BO logic in the controller or did you put them in a service class?&nbsp; </P>
<P>In previous CSLA WinForm applications I used an "object manager" to manage the state of the CSLA objects.&nbsp; CAB workitems&nbsp;maintain (and persist)&nbsp;state and this state can be used to pass objects to views.&nbsp; Did you guys use CAB's state to manage the state of your BO's or did you create an additional object manager?&nbsp; If not, how did you manage state?</P>

<P>The business objects shouldn't have any dependancies on the CAB.&nbsp; IMO you should keep your objects independant of any user interface layer.</P>
<P>I've found that in most cases I don't require services.&nbsp; Generally my controllers work with the BOs directly, and then they're simply bound to the view from the controller.&nbsp; I have in a couple of instances implemented a service that maintains a list of items that can take a while to retrieve from the server, so in effect I'm caching the objects.&nbsp; I have multiple controllers use this data and provide a refresh button to reload the data from the server.&nbsp; I have other services within the application such as a resource service and such, but these do not work with the CSLA objects.</P>
<P>As for CAB state, I do in a couple of instances save BOs to state when navigating from one WorkItem to another.&nbsp; If I can I navigate by firing internal module events as find this is a far neater solution.&nbsp; For example a ProjectListView could fire a ShowProjectDetailEvent with the ID of the project, and the ShowProjectDetailWorkItem would receive this and create the Project BO.</P>
<P>I hope this helps ~ I know this isn't strictly CSLA related (sorry Rocky!)</P>

<P>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I was just curious about whether or not you embedded any CAB attributes in your CSLA objects.&nbsp; I am not doing that, but, the thought did cross my mind.&nbsp; Think ActiveObjects.&nbsp; The pub/sub events and handlers would serve the same functionality as the Observer/Observable pattern employed by ActiveObjects.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also agree with you about puttin BO's and BO logic right in the controllers.&nbsp; Again, I just wanted to get feedback from you since you've been working with it for awhile.&nbsp; IMO to use a "service" layer for the BOs is a bit redundant.</P>
<P>I think I am going to implement an "object manager", as I have in other CSLA projects.&nbsp; Like you said, I will probably restrict the use of CAB state for passing objects to and from workitems and views.</P>
<P>Thanks again,</P>
