<p>I tried to open MvvmVideo\SlDemo\SlDemo.sln and got an error </p>
<p>&quot;One or more projects in the solution were not loaded correctly&quot; and </p>
<p>&quot;The project type is not supported by this installation.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Download and try agina, it should work.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JKMarsing replied on Sunday, November 28, 2010</h2><p>I had installed &quot;Silverlight 4 Toolkit&quot; with WPI which went ahead and installed &quot;Silverlight 4 Tools for Visual Studio 2010&quot;.&nbsp; My real problem though was that I needed to open the solution with MS Visual Developer 2010 Express not  MS Visual C# 2010 Express.</p>

<p>Thanks, problem resolved</p>
