However, I've just started an app where for the first time I'm using datagrids. I can bind a BusinessCollectionBase to a datagrid fine, it displays the data, I can format the columns etc.<br><br>The problem I have is the I can not edit the data. The data grid just simply won't let me edit the cells at all. <br><br>If I load an array list with several BusinessBase objects then I can edit the cells. Their not saving to the database but I've not looked into that.<br><br>Please help?<br><br>Tim<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, July 11, 2006</h2>First, is it a DataGrid or DataGridView?&nbsp; Also, what version of Csla?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>msolutions replied on Tuesday, July 11, 2006</h2>It is System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid. <br><br>As to the CSLA version not sure. The VersionInfo.vb file says 1.5.*, the downloaded zip file is CSLA10-041124.zip. I will download the latest CSLA to see if that makes a difference.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>msolutions replied on Wednesday, July 12, 2006</h2>1.53 now installed but still not allowing editing in DataGrid.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>msolutions replied on Wednesday, July 12, 2006</h2>OK I've solved my problem. It took me most of the day to realise I needed to set Collection.AllowEdit to true.<br><br>Also look out for AllowNew.<br><br>I'm sure this is all in the book but having recently moved the bible is safely packed away somewhere.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, July 12, 2006</h2>Glad you found it.&nbsp; Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier, I don't check the boards after I leave work.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vargasbo replied on Wednesday, July 12, 2006</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">Can you elaborate on what you mean by Collection.AllowEdit?
Are you talking about the data source itself, or the actually biz object?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
