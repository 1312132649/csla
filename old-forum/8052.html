Your data access layer can read data from one table, many tables or even many databases to do this work. This is the reason CSLA .NET separates the data access into its own layer (at least into DataPortal_XYZ methods, if not a completely separate DAL) - so you have this flexibility.</P>
<P>Just take any CSLA .NET example, find the data access code, and that's where you'd write data access code to read data from multiple tables.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
