<P>I thought about passing two hashtable objects (containing nothing but keys, which would be the ID of the&nbsp;entity to whom the overpayment was made) to the Web Services ... passing the first hashtable&nbsp;to the&nbsp;subscriber Web Service if the current row pertains to a&nbsp;subscriber and&nbsp;the second&nbsp;hashtable being passed to the provider Web Service if the current row pertains to a provider.&nbsp; Coming back from the Web Services would be the hashtables whose values would now be populated with the names of the entity to whom the overpayment was made.&nbsp; Doing this would require me to look up information in both hashtables tho' and I'm not exactly sure about how well that would work.</P>
<P>What I'd really like to do is hit each Web Service once for the entire gridview and have the Web Service make multiple queries against Sybase rather than what we're currently doing ... making multiple calls to the Web Services with the Web Service making a single call to Sybase.</P>
<P>Anyone have any thoughts on this?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
