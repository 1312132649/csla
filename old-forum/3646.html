<P>I have a problem when i call cancelEdit with the vb 3.0.2 version.</P>
<P>The bound fields would not get restored to the original values (the dirty state flag is always true).</P>
<P>This worked fine in vb 3.0.0 version.</P>
<P>I am using a sorted&nbsp;editableRootListBase class.</P>
<P>Thank you for your help.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, October 04, 2007</h2>Are you following the coding model in the current PTWin project? Data binding issues are as much about following that model as about anything in CSLA itself.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
