<P>Welcome to the forum!&nbsp; Here is a thread that should give you ideas with respect to the Pivot table:&nbsp; <A HREF="/forums/thread/20351.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/20351.aspx</A>.</P>
<P>I haven't tried to work with 'external' business logic yet, but I know my company wants to try to use ILog and I haven't had time to look into it yet.&nbsp; Hopefully some of the other brilliant minds on this forum can come to your (and mine) rescue on how to go about tackling integrating a rules engine.</P>
