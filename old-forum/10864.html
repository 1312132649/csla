<p>We are using csla and we like it very well.</p>
<p>One thing we want to improve is the performance of our app. Our&nbsp;silverlight client&nbsp;currently serializes huge business object and children&nbsp;objects,&nbsp;and then send it to server side every time even we just&nbsp;changed one small property, which slows down the app. Is there a way we can customize serialization in csla, for example, write our own json serializer instead, to&nbsp;pass limited&nbsp;data between client and server in&nbsp;different scenario?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tony</p>

<p>Version 4.3 will allow you to provide your own ISerializationFormatter implementation. Writing one of these isn&#39;t easy, and there are a lot of restrictions - like that it must provide equivalent functionality to MobileFormatter at a behavioral level.</p>
<p>Version 4.3 will also include a new CslaFormatter, which is more efficient than MobileFormatter.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
