<P>I took the CodeSmith templates and modified them heavily for my own purposes, but I do use the delegation methods. </P>
<P>The idea of these is for partial class generation - you have your generated code and sometimes you want to "hook into" the various data portal events - these delegate methods give you the opportunity to do that. So, in the user code you can hook up a delegate that will be called when the data portal method gets called. </P>
<P>For example, you could write some custom code to be executed after an object has been fetched from the DB, etc.</P>
