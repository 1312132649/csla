I have been referencing the sample projects heavily trying to understand good oo design principles and CSLA. I have been having a discussion with my co worker about proper use of encapsulation and how best to implement this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the sample ProjectTracker.Library there is the ResourceAssignmentEdit class. In that class there is a reference to the ProjectName and ProjectID. Why are these individual properties instead of a property for the ProjectEdit class. It seems like the Project Name and ID are attributes of the Project and the resource assignement uses them but should not contain them.</p>
<p>Should there be a reference to the Project Edit object in the Resource Assignment object? If not how does apply to encapsulation.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, December 04, 2013</h2><p>This is where you quickly get into trouble with serialization and you must understand how CSLA handle ownership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CSLA defaults to owning references. F.ex when you call BeginEdit the object creates a snapshop if itself and all its children. Imagine what happens when you have circular references.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or imagine how serialization in a N-tier deployment must be handled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In &nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;ProductID=24">Using CSLA 4: Creating Business Objects </a></strong>you will find documentation of&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>owning reference</li>
<li>inter-graph reference</li>
<li>using reference</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>and how to implement these.&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
