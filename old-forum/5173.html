<P>They cover the <EM>next</EM> pre-release of the code, which will be very soon, but much of what I've covered thus far would work (or be very close) to the last pre-release.</P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Then again, if you are pulling the code directly from svn you
could have caught it at a moment when the checked in code won&#8217;t build &#8211;

at once&#8230;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>This 3.6 and CSLA Light stuff is <i>very much in a state of

<p class=MsoNormal>Hi,<br>
I setup the project as you stated in your post. All projects got compiled,
except one SecuritTests.cs is giving following error:<br>
<br>
Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The type or namespace name
'TestBase' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly
reference?)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J:\My Downloads\CSLA\CSLA 3.6
Preview\cslatest\Csla.Test\Silverlight\Security\SecurityTests.cs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cslacs.Test<br>
<br>
I am using CSLA 2.1 for quite some time, but this is first time to interact
with CSLA 3.6, and with UnitTest projects.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

I went through the all the Readme.txt file, and check all configurations. That seems to me ok. I also download NUnit framewok, cuz. nunit.framework.dll was missing from Dependencies/ folder too. The 'TestBase' error was occuering, cuz refrence to UnitDriven namespace was missing from SecurityTests.cs file.<br>Know I came across another namespace 'Csla.Test.Silverlight.Engine' error is missing, and I was unable to find where this namespace exists. By commenting is out, finally, the project got compliled successfully.<br><br>Is 'Csla.Test.Silverlight.Engine' namespace is mandatory for testing?<br><br>Thnaks for the help.<br><br>Asad. &nbsp; <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
