<P>First of all, Happy Holidays to everyone out there.&nbsp; I am running the Rolodex example under Csla 3.8.2b and am having an issue with the Ranks displaying on the ComboBox control.&nbsp; Initially, when I edit a company, the CompanyEdit form comes up and the ComboBoxes with ranks are blank.&nbsp; However, if I select the Add button, a new row is created, but the ComboBoxes are still blank.&nbsp; THEN, if I select Cancel, the row dissapears and the Ranks are displayed on the ComboBoxes.</P>
<P>Also, when I first come to the CompanyEdit form and then press the Cancel button, the Ranks appear on the ComboBoxes.</P>
<P>Why are they not displaying initially?&nbsp; Any ideas anyone.&nbsp; I had been working on my application for a while and that same thing was happening, then I ran the Rolodex and the same thing happened, so I know I was NOT loosing my mind.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to get them to display initially would be much appreciated as I am tearing out what hair I have trying to figure this out.</P>
<P>Take care,<BR>Keith aka CyclingFoodmanPA</P>

<P>I am thinking I should just use that ComboBox all the time.</P>
