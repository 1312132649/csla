<P>I have a scenario that I imagine comes up quite often, but I'm unsure what the best way is to resolve it.</P>
<P>I've written a core library in CSLA that is used for maintaining application security.&nbsp; Several other CSLA apps are now being prototyped that use this security library.</P>
<P>These libraries allow for the creation&nbsp;/ maintenance&nbsp;of an application user, and the applications themselves allow for creation of a user as well as other functionality using this library.&nbsp; The individual apps show different permutations of the different security BOs data that is read&nbsp;from / written to the CSLA objects.</P>
<P>After that lead-in, here's my question:</P>
<P>I want to bind my objects to the application screens, but since each of the screens has slightly different permutations of the data, I can't use a DetailsView&nbsp;(web apps here) since&nbsp;only one object can be bound to these controls.&nbsp; In other words, the user apps have screens that want to treat combinations of two or three different BOs as a single entity on a screen, ie creating a user along with certain related properties that aren't in&nbsp;a single&nbsp;User BO.</P>
<P>Guess my most obvious options would be:</P>
<P>1&gt; 'Wrap' each of the business objects in a composite one and bind that to the controls.&nbsp; From reading the board, I suspect that this might be the recommended action, but in this scenario creating many different similar but different read/write CSLA&nbsp;objects isn't necessarily&nbsp;&nbsp;desirable. both from a productivity and maintenance standpoint.</P>
<P>2&gt; Programatically read / write from the form editors to the data source as needed (basically getting rid of built-in binding functionality.</P>
<P>Anyone have any insight as to what a 'best practice' might be for this?&nbsp; Seems common enough, but first time around the block for us with CSLA.&nbsp; Using VS2005 and CSLA3.x</P>
<P>TIA,</P>
<P>Glenn</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mtagliaf replied on Wednesday, March 12, 2008</h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">Search this forum for the thread titled "</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span id="ctl00_ctl01_bcr_ctl00___ForumName">Wrapping my head around basic concepts".

<P>Here's a slightly different phrasing of my issue that might drive home the point a little more clearly.</P>
<P>I have application-specific scenarios that use behaviors clearly defined in core libraries.&nbsp; These scenarios may involve a *composite* of different behaviors.&nbsp; In my opinion, the core libraries shouldn't attempt to account for every scenario a user application might dream up.</P>
<P>In a simplified scenario, I have a User class that handles the creation and management of a new User.&nbsp; There also exists a Membership class that handles extended information about a User (using an ASP.NET paradigm here).&nbsp; Each of these classes is complete and functional.</P>
<P>If one was to create a page where one wanted to utilize management of a User *and* his Membership and modify / save this information together, what might be the suggested approach?&nbsp; Binding to two CSLADataSources isn't possible using the 'view' collection of web controls in 2.0+.&nbsp; The binding mechanism isn't smart enough to 'walk' the relationship between the two classes.&nbsp; Using a DetailsView in this case would be great but the single-binding limitation doesn't allow for it.</P>
<P>Would one create a composite business class using&nbsp;using the relevant libraries and bind to that single class?&nbsp; Example appreciated for that approach.</P>
<P>I understand the concept of isolating behaviors, but am trying to avoid adding a number of very similar business objects to suit the needs of individual UI screens, especially if they involve changes to core libraries.</P>
