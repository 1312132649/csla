I asked this before in the old forum I think. Are there any fully functional datagrid or datagridview examples out there? I feel that the few examples I've found so far are too simplistic to work in my application. I need full editing features, with save back to the physical database. I'd like saves to occur after editing any field, with no 'commit changes' buttons or extra steps.
