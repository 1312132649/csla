<P>I've been at CSLA for about 2 years now...you picked (imo) the most complicated area to ask a question - how to build your object hierarchies.&nbsp; If you go over 2 levels (all being edited on the same screen) things start getting tricky.</P>
<P>Specifically your 2 examples deal with readonly collections and objects.&nbsp; The only time I really care about Root or not is on editable objects.&nbsp; I mean at the end of the day 'Root Object'&nbsp;only means that Save can be called publically.</P>
<P>Hope this helps</P>

<P>You'd use your second idea. ReadOnlyRoot is meant to be a root object (no parent). So I guess it's really not the top object because it's contained in a collection.</P>
