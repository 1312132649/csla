Lets assume that there is no legacy code involved. Here are some of my thoughts, ...</P>
<P>1. SOA will be slower ... all the wrapping in SOAP packets, XML parsing and such.</P>
<P>2. SOA will be less versatile ... CSLA remoting will not only "bring over" the object in question but all referenced objects as well (SOA does not have an equivalent).</P>
<P>3. SOA security is ??? Have never done this. Any advice?</P>
<P>4. AJAX and SOA seem to complement eachother. AJAX and CSLA, ???</P>
<P>5. SOA objects will need to be written in a "Chunky" manner, and should embrace Association over Composition.</P>
<P>Any insights, words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
