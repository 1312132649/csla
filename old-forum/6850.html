<P>The problem is that the "answer" to whether reading or writing is allowed is context dependent, even for the same user. So, a user may be able to read/write a property by proxy via another business object server side that they are not allowed to read or write directly client side. </P>
<P>However, the result is cached on the first read, so we can't implement our context dependency with the current mechanism.</P>
<P>If there was just some way my BusinessBase derived class could be allowed to answer the question "Should the cache be flushed", I could make this work. </P>

<P>I'll add the idea to the wish list.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Monday, April 27, 2009</h2><P>Thanks!</P>
<P>After I posted this, I discovered that I think my particular implementation could do what was needed by overriding CanReadProperty() and CanWriteProperty(). </P>
<P>In my case, I basically don't want to do any authorization checking on the server-side of the data portal. So, I just have these functions check the LogicalExecutionLocation and bypass the check if it's on the server. This is not a perfect solution, but I think it will work OK for what I need. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
