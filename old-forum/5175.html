<P>3.5.1 RC0 has a bug fix which affects how events cascade up, because cascading a child event up as a PropertyChanged event was very bad for data binding.</P>
<P>So now it cascades a child event up as a ChildChanged event instead of PropertyChanged.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, July 31, 2008</h2>I'm on 3.5.0.&nbsp; So what's the best way for the root BO to "hear" the ListChanged event from the child BO BLB so I can run the rule?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, July 31, 2008</h2>Ok.. so I'm trying the RC to see how I can get this working.&nbsp; It looks like the root BO needs to subscribe to the ChildChanged event on the child BLB?&nbsp; <br><br>That seems a step backwards to me... 3.5 allowed me to remove code to handle wiring up events, and now that's what I have to do.&nbsp; Am I missing something?<br><br>Thanks<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, July 31, 2008</h2>Nevermind..
