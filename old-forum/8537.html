<p>As far as static goes... I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;d gain by having it as an instance, especially when you then need to worry about thread safety.&nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>Alex Ilyin replied on Tuesday, February 16, 2010</h2><p>Thank you for the answer. I understand that if so many users successfully use CSLA then problem I am talking should have solution. Let me explain scenario I am interested in - my application consumes data from several dataBase servers. For example, dataBase A stores Orders and dataBase B stores Users, they know nothing about each other. I want Order Objects to be transparently persisted at Server A and Users to be transparently persisted at Server B, but I can specify just one &quot;WcfDataPortal&quot; endpoint in configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;client&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;endpoint name=&quot;WcfDataPortal&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address=&quot;http://localhost:21647/WcfPortal.svc&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; binding=&quot;wsHttpBinding&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contract=&quot;Csla.Server.Hosts.IWcfPortal&quot; /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/client&gt;</p>
<p>So I have to choose will it be http://ServerA.com/WcfPortal.svc or http://ServerB.com/WcfPortal.svc. I am almost sure that I just do not understand something, so if you explain me how this issue can be resolved I&#39;ll be very grateful.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, February 16, 2010</h2><p>You can read the item on multiple data portal server configurations in the FAQ, that might help. This is most certainly a frequently asked question in one form or another.</p>
