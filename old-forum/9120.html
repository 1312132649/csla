<p>I&#39;m currently working on a project&nbsp;featuring localization depending on a&nbsp;login&nbsp;related culture. Basically, for each user logged in, there can be a different culture assigned (in DB). </p>
<p>I have defined rules that have to&nbsp;be checked either on on server or on client side (or even on both sides). As this rules have to provide a description of the reason why they may be broken, how can I proceed to ensure correct localization&nbsp;?&nbsp; My problem is that the rules on client side (silverlight) are&nbsp;generated in the correct culture whereas those on the server are generated in the server&#39;s side default culture... Is there any stategy ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I let the&nbsp;default culture on server side, and then translate them when received on client? Shall I switch the culture on the server side, depending&nbsp;on the user&#39;s identity? Any other ideas?</p>
<p>(I&#39;m using the following environnement: .NET 4, SL4, EF4, CSLA&nbsp; 3.8.3)</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>
<p>Christophe</p>

You can either back-port the data portal changes from CSLA 4 into your 3.8 code, or you can move to CSLA 4.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
