Does that second object have to be a child object? Currently it is not and I am getting a EditLevelMismatchException when I acceptchanges or undo them.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>Are you using a CSLA managed property? If so, CSLA should update the edit level for you automatically when you set or load the property value. </P>
<P>If you aren't using managed properties, then I recommend&nbsp;doing so, if only properties which are either child lists or other objects. CSLA will handle keeping the edit level up to date for you and avoid bugs like this. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
