This is similar to what Rocky does with his project edit &nbsp;windows&nbsp;control example in bus objs 2005.</P>
<P>I have an editable city list. The city objects have an associated province. When i display this in the grid, I want the provinces to be displayed in the drop down combobox. When I try to&nbsp;set the datasource for the&nbsp;the combobox in the columns edit dialog, it tells me "object not set to an instance".&nbsp; Of course in the example Rocky shows, the binding source control shows up in the datasoure property. I can't find a way of getting my provinces binding control to show up in the datasource property.</P>
<P>I am currently building a workaround to this manually, but it would be great if it would work the way it does in the book so I would not have to populate the combobox manually and manually handle events to set the province. </P>

<P>Thanks</P>

<P>You do need to add the object as a data source. You can do that in the Data Sources window ahead of time, or there's an option to add the object as a data source in the data source selection process. I don't recall the specific terminology they use, but it is possible directly in that drop-down where you get to select from the existing data sources.</P>
<P>Either way, once it is a valid data source, when you use it to configure your column, Visual Studio will automatically add the appropriate bindingsource object to your form.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jhw replied on Monday, September 10, 2007</h2><P>Yes it is a windows foms control.</P>
<P>I must be having problems with visual studio as I do have all my objects added as datasources. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After I drag a collection on, the datagrid and binding source are automatically added. If I go to properties of either of the controls, I have the same problem. Even though the datasource is already set, I still get the object not set to an instance error if I click the drop down error for that datasource. So far google has not helped. Has anyone had this problem?</P>

When I checked out the datasources for my project, there was 1 listed that was marked with a warning. When I removed that item, everything started working.</P>
