<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>There are two applications that will interface to this business-layer; one that is purely read-only and will present the survey to the user and collect responses. The other is a management application to create surveys.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>In such a case, should I design two sets of business objects (read-only and editable) or simply design editable objects and have both applications interface to them. Will there be a significant difference in performance?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Thank you.</FONT></P>

<P>So for the Read Only scenario I would use a ROC. (It is lighter weight and does not contain validation rules.)</P>
<P>I would use Editable objects for the other scenario.</P>

I am convinced of that now; I've been reading a few other posts and a use-case based design seems like the right way to go.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Tuesday, October 23, 2007</h2>As you get further into your project, you will probably find that you frequently need two copies of most entities - an Editable one and a ReadOnly one.&nbsp; This is normal in a CSLA environment.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
