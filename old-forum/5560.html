<p class=MsoNormal><span>6 is technically not a couple :- )<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp; If I were to build business objects for a .net
winforms application today, can these business objects be ported over to
silverlight with relative ease?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp; -- Yes if you use latest syntax (3.6)<br>
<br>
2. Are business objects written in CSLA for .net clients only? Or is it
possible for java clients to consume them?<br>
&nbsp; --&nbsp; I am not familiar with his approach.&nbsp; My guess is that you
would need to write a custom service to expose CSLA objects in a format that
Java understands.<br>
<br>
3. Does CSLA.net have any mechanisms that support updating stale data
automatically and record locking? I haven't seen a solution to pushing out data
to clients if their data changes locally.<br>
&nbsp; -- CSLA is built with premise of abstract data persistence.&nbsp; It
does support locking via transaction scope, but depends on DB engine to
understand that.<br>
<br>
4. What are the direct competitors to CSLA.net? <br>
&nbsp;-- I am not sure.<br>
<br>
5. Does anyone know if silverlight will likely be able to run on mobile phones
such as the Iphone or linux?<br>
&nbsp; --&nbsp; In the future definitely yes. &nbsp;MS has plans to support
this scenario in the very near future.<br>
<br>
6. Is there any licensing fees for CSLA.net? Or is the this an open source
business model ( pay for the expertise )?<br>
&nbsp;-- No.&nbsp; You cannot beat the price of free, can you?&nbsp; Read
licencing agreement for more details.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Greetings. I am new to this forum and to CSLA.net and have a
couple questions about CSLA.net<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; If I were to build business objects for a .net winforms application
today, can these business objects be ported over to silverlight with relative
ease?<br>
<br>
2. Are business objects written in CSLA for .net clients only? Or is it
possible for java clients to consume them?<br>
<br>
3. Does CSLA.net have any mechanisms that support updating stale data
automatically and record locking? I haven't seen a solution to pushing out data
to clients if their data changes locally.<br>
<br>
4. What are the direct competitors to CSLA.net? <br>
<br>
5. Does anyone know if silverlight will likely be able to run on mobile phones
such as the Iphone or linux?<br>
<br>
6. Is there any licensing fees for CSLA.net? Or is the this an open source
business model ( pay for the expertise )?<br>
<br>
So far, I have been using datasets with winforms applications. While it is easy
to get objects into and out of the database there really isn't a standardized
way to implement business logic, thus I am looking for a framework that can
simplify and standardize the development process. <br>
<br>
Thank you for any and all comments. <br>

<P>Since it is likely that the book and Silverlight will literally come out within a couple weeks of each other, I'd have to delay publishing the book for 2-3 months for it to cover Silverlight - and that's unworkable.</P>
<P>The good news, however, is that 85% of the book's content applies to CSLA .NET for Silverlight just as much as it does to Windows. The frameworks are essentially the same, and we back-ported all the Silverlight functionality into the Windows version in 3.6 - including the most important UI controls (PropertyStatus in particular) for WPF and the asynchronous data portal and validation rules concepts.</P>
<P>In other words, the 2008 book really does cover the framework for Silverlight - it just doesn't cover the creation of a Silverlight app using CSLA .NET. That'll almost certainly be an ebook and/or some training videos which I'll work on starting (probably) in December or January.</P>
<P>Right now if you want to see CSLA .NET for Silverlight in action you should plan to attend <A href="http://www.vslive.com">VS Live</A> in Dallas in December, or VS Live San Francisco in February as I'll be talking about it at both of those shows. Or if you are in the Minnesota area, come to the <A href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Default.aspx">code camp</A> in two days, because I'll be talking about it there.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
