If the default values are need at the consumers end, will you then need to create a new web method in order to return default project data?<br /><br />Querstion2: In the sample, Rocky uses parameters for each field. What if my parameters list becomes to long? I have about 10 mandatory fields in order for Customer to be created.<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, October 22, 2008</h2><P>First thing to recall is that PT is used to show various ways to accomplish things. It is not 100% "best practices". Also - there is nothing stopping you from modifying things to sduit your needs.</P>
<P>#1 - Then don't expose those values in the parameter list! A new project gets created under the hood and the default values are set and only those in the param list that *you expose* overwrite defaults. The param list can be the minimum amount of data required to save a valid project. Maybe just ID and Name - all other fields&nbsp;can be filled in later.</P>
<P>#2 - Intead of using a param list, use a class like ProjectRequest to pass in the data as a single parameter. You can expand ProjectRequest to act as a DTO with 10 fields and Properties which can be filled out by the client and passed to the AddProject method which just reads the Properties instead of reading a param list.</P>
