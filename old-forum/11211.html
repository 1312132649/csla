My root object has 1 child, the child has 2 grand children objects.</p>
<p>During loading the windows form, after retrieving root object(no any binding right now), &nbsp;I did root.BeginEdit(). The 2 grand children has 2 different edit level, i.e. 0 and 1. </p>
<p>Do you have any idea? Is the grand children&#39;s problem? Thanks in advance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, March 06, 2012</h2><p>Could you post the code for us to check/verify the problem? </p>
<p>All the child/grandchild should be on the same EditLevel after BegEdit on the root object.</p>
<p>Is any of the grandchild objects lazy loaded or created by a rule? </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fredg replied on Tuesday, March 06, 2012</h2><p>Thanks for your reply. The code is a bit long.</p>
<p>I did more debug. When calling BeginEdit() on grandchild 0 (which has different edit level from root), get &quot;Expression has been evaluated and has no value&quot; error;&nbsp; when calling BeginEdit() on grandchild1 (which has same edit level&nbsp;as root), get &quot;Edit level mismatch in CopyState&quot; error.</p>
<p>What do you mean &quot;lazy loaded or created by a rule&quot;? i think grandchild is loaded as its parent.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, March 06, 2012</h2><p>Just trying to find out if both grand children is loaded at the same time in data access or if one may be created from on the client side by a Rule. </p>
<p>Seems like both grandchildren is loaded the data access code (Fetch)? </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fredg replied on Wednesday, March 07, 2012</h2><p>All grand children is loaded at the same time in data access.
