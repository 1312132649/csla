I am in a situation where an error is occurring inside a sproc, but from the UI point of view, everything seems to be alright. But when I check the database table, an update has not actually occurred.<br />Regards,<br />Joe</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Tuesday, December 23, 2008</h2>You should be getting an error.&nbsp; Are you sure you aren't trapping it somewhere?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, December 24, 2008</h2><P>Rocky is very clear in the books about *not* catching errors in the data portal code that you write. If a failure occurs you want the framework to catch it and pass it back to you. So you should check your code to see if you are catching any exceptions in the data portal.</P>

I must have been doing something wrong because now i am correctly getting the db errors. Thanks both.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
