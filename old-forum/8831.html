<p>we have an environement where we&#39;re running csla client through wcf web service defined in app.config file. &nbsp;my question is , is there anything i can pass in address to the endpoint through code instead? i am trying to have the endpoint retrieved from a web service everytime the application start , that way we can dynamically switch client from 1 server to another (a back up server while the main one is down for maintenance for example). &nbsp;and possibly add some load balancing logic running multiple server.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Though if you really want load balancing you&#39;ll be better off putting a router appliance in front of your web/app servers - that&#39;ll work far better and more reliably than trying to roll some half-baked thing in your own code (been there, done that, got the t-shirt...)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tuan nguyen replied on Friday, April 23, 2010</h2><p>thank you , i&#39;ll take a look into that</p>
