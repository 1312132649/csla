I managed to do this by calling a procedure in the list object but the moved item is marked as dirty, savable and deleted. When I tried to remove the flag by calling&nbsp;item.IsDirty = false, the framework complained because it is read only. How can I clear those flags? Thanks.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2>You aren't meant to change these flags manually.&nbsp; The base class handles this.&nbsp; <br><br>The flag IsDirty is correct because the item has changed since it was loaded from the database; namely it was marked for deletion.<br><br>Your object should know how to remove itself form the database and after the successful db operation, you should have the item call its MarkNew method.&nbsp; This will properly mark the object to match its state in the db (New, and by definition, also dirty).&nbsp; Normally you lose the reference to the deleted object though, but you don't necessarly have to.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2><P>Variations on this have been discussed in other threads.</P>
<P>I really think the right answer for positional objects is to have the child object include a Position property and then to use a SortedBindingList to sort against that property. Don't actually try to put the child objects in specific positions in the list, but rather create a sorted view that <EM>shows</EM> them in specific positions based on the Position property.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kucing replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2><P>Thanks.</P>
<P>However, it will be much nicer to have the control on changing those states....</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
