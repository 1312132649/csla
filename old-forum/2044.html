If not, what's the preferred way to call the CanReadProperty/CanWriteProperty methods to hard code this? It seems that these cannot be exposed as shared methods like CanEditObject.<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Thursday, December 28, 2006</h2>I am sure that it could be extended to include the DataGridView, but in the meantime, you may want to check to see if you can make cells editable or read-only as CanReadProperty/CanWriteProperty could change from row to row.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 29, 2006</h2>That's a good point.&nbsp; Probably the best way to handle this would be on an event that fires as each row is processed by the grid.&nbsp; Infragistics grid for example has RowInitialize.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Thunderstruck replied on Friday, December 29, 2006</h2><P>I have a co-worker who used a delegate against the DataGridView.BackColor property,&nbsp;"pointing" it to a function that would return an integer value (corresponding to a color) if a particular criteria was met or not.&nbsp; If I'm not mistaken, this falls under .NET's complex binding feature.</P>
<P>I don't see why this approach wouldn't work using the DataGridView.ReadOnly property.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
