<P>Both of the forms have a BindingSource object.&nbsp; The address user control has a BindingSource as well.&nbsp; </P><FONT color=#0000ff>
<P>Me</FONT><B>.ucAddresses.AddressesBindingSource.DataSource = </B><FONT color=#0000ff>Me</FONT><B>.PersonBindingSource</B></P>
<P>My problem is that in the custom user control, I need to add an item to the Person.Addresses collection.&nbsp; It won't let me, because there is no public constructor.&nbsp; I was expecting it would use the AddNewCore() function, but that doesn't appear to be the case.</P>
<P>cur = <FONT color=#0000ff>Me</FONT><B>.AddressesBindingSource.AddNew()</B></P>
<P>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should deal with this problem?</P>

Can we see the code?<br>Did you set AllowNew = True for your collection?<br><br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JZuerlein replied on Wednesday, February 07, 2007</h2><P>My bad. </P>
<P>On the form I was testing, the line....</P><B>
<P></B><FONT color=#0000ff>Me</FONT><B>.ucAddresses.AddressesBindingSource.DataSource = </B><FONT color=#0000ff>Me</FONT><B>.PersonBindingSource</B></P>
