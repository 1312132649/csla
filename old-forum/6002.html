<P>Under the hypothetical situation where you would be using project tracker with 20 branch offices - where would you store your data for all these locations. Would you store them on computers in each office and possibly backup to the cloud? Would you store them on the cloud and hope that your connection to the cloud doesn't go down?<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I'm just trying to think of how you can create all of these locations and then keep them up to date based on the latest business rules and how easy that would be. <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Is there any material that could help make this clearer? <o:p></o:p></P>
