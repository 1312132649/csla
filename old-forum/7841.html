You may look at the ProjectTracker sample from <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/N2.aspx">Csla 3.7.1 for N2</a> that allows you to configure one of&nbsp; 2 independent Factories (Subsonic or raw ADO.NET). <br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Dane replied on Thursday, October 22, 2009</h2>Excellent!&nbsp; That's exactly what I was looking for and&nbsp;worked like a charm.&nbsp; Thanks.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
