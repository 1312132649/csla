Or is it normal practice for you to sort the list on the client all the time no matter what?<br /><br />I know is up to me to do it however I want, I am simply curious to know what you guys do.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, March 29, 2011</h2><p>If the user scenario requires or allows pre-sorted data, that is the way to go. Let the database do the work, because it is good at that.</p>
<p>If the user scenario requires client-side sorting (or resorting) that&#39;s fine too.</p>
<p>If you need to do paged data, then the sort really has to be server-side in order to do the paging.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
