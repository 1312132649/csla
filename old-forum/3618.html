<P>I'm new to CSLA world. I'm very sorry for asking a dumb question.</P>
<P>Is there any feature or functionality difference between CSLA 2.x C# version and VB.NET version?</P>
<P>I hope both the versions does have same kind of features and functionality.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>So the VB version has all the good stuff in it.&nbsp; (Just kidding.)</P>
<P>In fact, they are identical. </P>
<P>Although Rocky had to learn how to add semi-colons and curly braces to VB in order to get C# code to run.</P>
<P>Ok - just kidding again. Rocky actually learned C# style coding so that it is an excellent example of how to write good code.</P>
<P>Rocky tries very hard to keep the 2 versions in synch. In fact, the latest eBook (released yesterday) came out with the C# code first. The VB version of the book will take a few more days as Rocky re-learns his first language.</P>

In fact, the unit tests are one set of tests that test both framework versions, just to make sure they are interchangeable.</P>
<P>And Joe, VB wasn't my first language <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></P>
<P>I think it goes like this:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Integer AppleSoft</LI>
<LI>Floating Point AppleSoft</LI>
<LI>Apple Pascal (pretty "pure" Pascal)</LI>
<LI>VAX Pascal (Pascal, but with a lot of custom VAX features)</LI>
<LI>VAX Macro Assembler (one of the coolest assemblers ever built)</LI>
<LI>C (Aztec compiler on the Commodore 64)</LI>
<LI>VAX FORTRAN</LI>
<LI>DCL (VAX shell language)</LI>
<LI>Some simulation language with a 4 letter acronym/name</LI>
<LI>A math-oriented language that could do calculus - again, don't remember the name</LI>
<LI>COBOL (thankfully only in school - never for real)</LI>
<LI>RPG 3 (ugh! I wrote a Pascal tool to generate my RPG)</LI>
<LI>Turbo Pascal (like Pascal, but ever so much moreso)</LI>
<LI>VAX Basic (perhaps still the most powerful Basic I ever used)</LI>
<LI>Modula II (Pascal on steroids)</LI>
<LI>VAX C++ (a second class language on the VAX, but still interesting)</LI>
<LI>GC++ (much easier on Unix than on the VAX)</LI>
<LI>Excel macro language (pre-VBA)</LI>
<LI>Postscript (I really wrote PS programs by hand, insane but true)</LI>
<LI>True Basic (write once, run everywhere - for real!)</LI>
<LI>Visual Basic 1.0-6.0</LI>
<LI>rexx (arexx actually - on the Amiga)</LI>
<LI>awk (gnu awk on Unix, the VAX and DOS)</LI>
<LI>VBscript (yes, this really is totally different from VB itself!)</LI>
<LI>VB .NET, later VB 2005, now VB 9</LI>
<LI>C# 1.0-3.0</LI>
<LI>XAML</LI></OL>
<P>I've also dabbled in some other languages like Oberon, Java, the FlexWiki script language (a functional programming language), etc.</P>
<P>Also, I wonder if Windows Workflow (WF) qualifies as a language. It is XAML-based, so perhaps it fits under XAML.</P>
<P>Note that HTML isn't in the list. It isn't a real language, sorry. A markup language to be sure, but not a programming language. If we count HTML here, then all the ESC sequence programmong from my VAX days should count, and perhaps all the control markup codes from my C64 word processor should count too <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
<P>A long time ago I blogged about my view that <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/ARamblingRantOnProgrammingLanguages.aspx">any decent programmer should know at least two languages from two different language families</A>. I <EM>strongly</EM> believe that is true. Languages come and go, but the cool features from each language family provide a conceptual base that allows people to be adaptible over time. If you only know C-style or Basic-style languages, you are crippling your understanding of computing and ultimately your career.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
