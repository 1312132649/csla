<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I am developing a ConsultingTracker web app similar to Rocky's ProjectTracker. In the web app, I have a global resources file to handle strings such as UserCreatedMsg and so on. However in my business objects, when server side validation fails, it seems that I need another Resources file there for messages like NoDuplicatesAllowed, et. These are custom Csla.Validation handlers that need to have certain Resource file messages upon failure.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>My question is - do I need to have two Resource files (one on web, one in business object library) or is there a way to consolidate. I noticed that my Resources file in the business object library was marked "internal" - any thoughts on making this "public"?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Thanx!</FONT></P>

<P>1. Microsoft suggests changing the scope of each property in the resource file to public so that it will be available to client apps.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the next time you open the resource file in the designer, it will reset them all back to internal and you'll be back to square one.</P>
<P>2. Create a proxy class that exposes the same properties as in your resource file but delegates to the internal resource file.&nbsp; For example:</P>
<P><CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; public namespace Resources<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public class Strings<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public string HelloWorld<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; get<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return InternalResources.Strings.HelloWorld;<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; } </CODE></P>
<P>Of course, you'll have to be diligent to make sure that this class remains in-sync with the internal resource file.</P>
<P>3. I believe there is a way to accomplish this using external resource files that can be shared between assemblies, but I've never done this so I'm not sure what is required.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If there are other suggestions, I'd be anxious to hear them.</P>
<P>HTH</P>
