<P>Where can I find a template for the SortedBindingList please?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Thursday, December 21, 2006</h2>Huh?&nbsp; The SortedBindingList is a part of the CSLA framework.&nbsp; You do not generate it.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jasmeet replied on Thursday, December 21, 2006</h2><P>I had downloaded the framework.</P>
<P>And one of the projects in it was the Templates which contained shells for various csla business objects which provide a launching point to creating the objects.</P>
<P>There wasn't one for the sortedBindingList.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Thursday, December 21, 2006</h2>The SortedBindingList provides a sorted view onto an IList&lt;T&gt;.&nbsp; You only need the one class to have this functionality.<br><br>The templates that you are referring to are for giving an indication of how you would structure some of the CSLA stereotypes (EditableObject, ReadOnlyObject, etc.).&nbsp; SortedBindingList does not have a template in there as it is not something that you will create.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
