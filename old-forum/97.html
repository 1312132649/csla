I'm planning to develop an application using CSLA and&nbsp;GUID for primary key. To fulfill the requirement from different customer, the database may not be MS SQL.&nbsp;Is GUID supported in other major database like Oracle or DB2?</P>

<DIV>Still use guids though, just a 32 char field.&nbsp; Works fine. Have made a smartguid that converts it to the proper format.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Sunday, May 14, 2006</h2><P>This might help <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2000/reskit/part2/c0761.mspx?mfr=true">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2000/reskit/part2/c0761.mspx?mfr=true</A>.</P>

Used as strings it can be 32 / 36 bytes (depending on the "-"s). Or double that if you store them as a unicode string. So storing 72 bytes for something that really is 16 is _bad_.<br><br>Read this thread for more info:<br>http://www.searchcsla.com/Details.aspx?msn_id=22852<br><br>(Although there are probably many threads that talk about guids in the old forum)<br><br>Andr√©s<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
