My company has made significant investments in WPF and L2S/CSLA. Before the PDC I was worried that desktop WPF would play second fiddle against Sliverlight but after sitting in on the .NET 4.0 sessions I am not worried anymore. I am blindsided about the rumors regarding L2S. We moved from LLBL to Linq because it was simplier and gave us compile time field and type checking. EF seems to be an overkill for what we need. I need a simple DAL. I really don't want to move 500+ BO classes again. Rocky, you have any deeper insight than these blog rumors?<br><br><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david.hayden/archive/2008/10/30/linq-to-sql-gets-kicked-to-the-curb-needs-a-good-home.aspx">http://codebetter.com/blogs/david.hayden/archive/2008/10/30/linq-to-sql-gets-kicked-to-the-curb-needs-a-good-home.aspx<br></a><br><a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/10/31/microsoft-kills-linq-to-sql.aspx">http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/10/31/microsoft-kills-linq-to-sql.aspx<br></a><br>-Paul<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, October 31, 2008</h2>Hmm.. maybe I'm being naive, but saying EF is preferred doesn't mean they aren't going to invest in L2S.&nbsp; Actually, the original MS post said they would continue to do so.&nbsp; <br><br>L2S has been working really well for me.. it's simple, and even if they don't support it, it seems to handle everything I want.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Friday, October 31, 2008</h2>I love working with L2S.&nbsp; My only hangup is it is limited to Sql Server.&nbsp; I wish Oracle would get on the ball.&nbsp; There are some third party options out there, but you either have to pay for them, or the free one (dblinq) isn't ready for primetime.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>nermin replied on Friday, October 31, 2008</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Personally,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I have been playing with EF lately trying to port few apps from
L2S to EF, and with each chunk of code that I try to port I discover another thing
that one can do in Ling to Sql but is impossible in EF.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And
that can be quite irritating.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I truly believe that EF version 1.0 &nbsp;is incomplete &#8211;
should not be considered as a serious ORM. &nbsp;I think it will take a version
2 or 3 until they &#8220;work the kinks out&#8221;.&nbsp; Meantime &#8211; I am
planning on using Linq, NHibernate, ActiveRecord, and not waste my time on EF.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>EF is probably the future, but it is going to take quite some
time to get to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hmm.. maybe I'm being naive, but saying EF is preferred
doesn't mean they aren't going to invest in L2S.&nbsp; Actually, the original
MS post said they would continue to do so.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
L2S has been working really well for me.. it's simple, and even if they don't
support it, it seems to handle everything I want.<br>
