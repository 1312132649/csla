<P>Hi</P>
<P>I have a class that inherits BusinessListBase and I have sucessfully bound that to a list on a form.&nbsp; What I am trying to do is double click an item on a list, open a new form and bind all textboxes to that item from the list, when I close the form update the list.</P>
<P>What is the best way to achieve this, I am just learning CSLA so please bear with me.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>I hate to say it, but take a look at Rocky's ProjectTracker application.&nbsp; He actually&nbsp;covers double-clicking a list bound to a BusinessListBase (ProjectResources) object as well as&nbsp;a list bound to a ReadOnlyListBase object.&nbsp; In the C# book start reading at page 494 to 497 to see how to handle what to do in the double-click event (in the book's case the OK button)&nbsp;of the list form.&nbsp; Pages 497 to 505 cover the "Edit" form which in your case covers the new form opening and binding the textboxes to the single selected object.</P>
<P>It is hard to explain it any better than Rocky.</P>
