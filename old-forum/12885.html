<p>Spent a few hours yesterday making some big changes around .NET 4.6 and VS15.</p>
<p>In GitHub there&#39;s now a V4-5-x branch that will be used to maintain the existing 4.5 version of CSLA that uses VS13 and targets .NET 4.5, WinRT, Silverlight, etc.</p>
<p>The master branch in GitHub will be soon moving to VS15 to add support for .NET 4.6. This will also be version 4.6.x of CSLA.</p>

<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>I am explicitly dropping support for Silverlight and Windows Phone 7/8.</p>
<p>I have not decided yet if CSLA 4.6 will continue to support .NET 4 or 4.5. I&#39;ll make that determination as I work on .NET 4.6 support. My guess is that (at least for now) the changes will be minimal enough that I can retain support for 4 and 4.5.</p>
<p>If possible I plan to retain support for WinRT in CSLA 4.6, along with adding support for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) for Windows 10 (PC, mobile, Xbox, etc.).</p>
<p>The start of this work is in GitHub in the rockfordlhotka/csla fork.</p>
