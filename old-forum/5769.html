<p class=MsoNormal><span>Assembly name is playing an important role in communicating
between Silverlight client and .NET server.&nbsp; As you may have noticed by
looking at the Rolodex project that it also has the same assembly name as well
as root namespace for client and the server, just like CSLA itself.&nbsp; What
you are trying to accomplish is to have the same assembly qualified class names
on both sides in order for client and the server to know how to exchange the
information as well as be able to share classes between different projects.&nbsp;
It stems from the fact that in Silverlight environment client and the server are
actually using different run times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hello, is it possible declare different assembly names for
each part of CSLA framework? For example <b>Csla.dll </b>for original CSLA.NET
framework and <b>Csla.Light.dll</b> for new CSLA.NET for Silverlight framework.
Current situation with the same assembly naming for client and server side
causes a little mess in referencing in VS2008 projects. These assemblies must
be located in different folders and at first look on the assembly name, I don't
know what assembly type it represents<br>

<P>So, I started from the Rolodex and added my items and I was getting my server code to run, so I started reorganizing and renaming things and then things started failing again. I had changed my assembly names for my client project and server project to be different and consistent with their project names -- boy was that a tough one to track down. </P>
<P>Changed both to the same assembly name in project properties and everything started working. </P>
<P>(Changed post title a bit to match what I would have searched for)</P>
