Doesn't seem like it should matter though. Here's the basic:<BR>Customer : BusinessBase (int customerID)<BR>Contact : BusinessBase (Guid contactID)<BR>CustomerContact : BusinessBase (long recordID) each record contains a customerID and contactID and the collection correctly does not allow dups<BR>CustomerContacts : BusinssCollectionBase</P>
<P>Does this need to be an integer on the child? Seems like it should work with a Guid, but maybe int is more functional?</P>
<P>I'm using a DevExpress LookupEdit control in the cell to allow the users to select the contact from a pop up control that limits the contacts to the selected customer. This all works well elsewhere, so I believe it's just the Guid issue I mentioned. Should I rewrite the Customer class to use an integer-base id to simplify?</P>

My users don't like it so I'm modifying the collection to use an int instead of the Guid so they can just select from the already exposed control instead of invoking a dialog.</P>
<P>I was able to intercept the value, but it was a big pain so I just switched it out.</P>
