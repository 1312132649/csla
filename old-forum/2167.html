<P>However, in the example, this is not done (the child objects are only added after the Project object has been added and reloaded so this code is not applicable in the DataPortal_Insert method.</P>
<P>Am I wrong, and if not, how do I make it work correctly so I can save child objects at the same time I save root objects?</P>
<P>Thanks in advance for your help.</P>

I chose to do Project one way, and Resource a different way to illustrate different techniques you can use to insert/update/delete your data.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
