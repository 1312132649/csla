<P>I have an object that is now approaching 40 properties in size but at any one time only 10 properties are edited on 1 of 4 screens.&nbsp; Is this an area where it would be best to normalize the behaviour of the object in to 4 seperate objects?</P>
<P>I am a total newbie!!!!<BR><BR>Pixel.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triplea replied on Tuesday, October 30, 2007</h2><P>If the behaviour of these 4 "sets" of data is different then probably yes. The fact that&nbsp;different properties&nbsp;are edited in different screens suggest you have 4 different use cases so make sure your objects fulfil your use cases correctly.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Tuesday, October 30, 2007</h2><P>Good advice.&nbsp; Here are some issues to consider.</P>
<P>Is each of the 4 screens a single part of a 4 part wizard?&nbsp; Or are they all separate?</P>
<P>Does each screen model an object that is "valid" when all the data has been entered on that screen?&nbsp; Or is more data needed to make the object valid?</P>
<P>Do you have a need (i.e. use case) for a "big" object - one that has all 40 properties at the same time?&nbsp; Perhaps that object is an aggregate of the other 4 individual objects that each have 10 properties.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, October 30, 2007</h2><P>If it is a 4 part wizard or Tabbed interface where the user fills out all 40 pieces spread out over 4 screens then it should be a single BO.</P>
<P>If it is 4 separate screens for 4 different reasons then it should probably be 4 BOs.</P>
