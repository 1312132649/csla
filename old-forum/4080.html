<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>We have a process for collecting network traffic from different sources.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Each type of traffic has its own data shape (number of fields and data type).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The customer would like to be able search the data to create a report that shows the activity on the network (based on their criteria).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>One search result could display multiple types of traffic that will be displayed in different grids (due to the different fields that apply to the message type).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Currently all query parameters are sent to a web service and returns a data set with each message type as a separate data table ( we control the web service so it could return anything we need).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>A result set is likely to include multiple message types that represents different types of activities accruing at the same time (or range of time) and location.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The user would also like to save profiles allow them to customize what fields are displayed, column order, and formatting for each message type.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
