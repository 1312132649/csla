The ErrorProvider control is an extender control, and it will extend all visible controls that are bound to the same binding source as your ErrorProvider - so you should not have one per visible control, but rather one per binding source.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, June 06, 2006</h2>Ok.. I'll remove the extras and see what happens.<br><br>Thanks<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
