<P>My problem is this: I would like (need) to use sourcecontrol for the safety of my code, but I am continually switching my code from a desktop pc to a notebook depending where I am that day. With using MS Visual Sourcesafe this always caused me problems, so I am tempted not to use it but to continue copying files from one machine to the other (which is dangerous).</P>
<P>I would ask whether it is possible to have a sourcecontol solution that I can use over two machines and what sourcecontrol software would people recommend.</P>

They give you integration into VS, along with pretty decent network access to your server.<br><br>If you don't have that level of upgraded Universal MSDN you may want to look at less expensive alternatives. <br><br>A lot of people use Subversion, and it is easy enough to get running - give it a couple days of downloading, finding random docs and trying to get it configured and running and you are set to go. Use TortoiseSVN as a client. I'm being a bit sarcastic here about the time it takes - but it is a free open-source FOSS project and has the typical documentation of this sort of project, which means you have to infer a lot and mess around to get it running. But once it is running it is very nice to use. It is tailored to work well over a network. I really did spend a lot of time getting it all figured out - installing various other OSS products it requires, etc. (don't make the mistake I did, of installing the latest of everything out there - SVN doesn't work with the latest versions of its dependencies - so make sure to get the older ones it requires!!)<br><br>Similarly, a lot of people (including me) use cvs (which is also a FOSS project). It is easier to get running because it is older and more mature, and has some Windows installer msi's to get the server set up and going. Use TortoiseCVS on the client. cvs works well enough over a network - far better than VSS, better than TFS but not as good as SVN.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Tuesday, August 22, 2006</h2><P>This is terrific timing for me.&nbsp; I just got started this week on finding a replacement for VSS because I want to have remote programming teammates soon.</P>
<P>I dowloaded Tortoise CVS and it looked great.&nbsp; But my supposition that it would work on my FTP server was wrong.&nbsp; It requires an active server component (and I don't think my ISP is going to smile kindly on that).</P>
<P>Do I have any options?&nbsp; Are there "client" programs out there that can handle all the versioning work with a remote repository?</P>
<P>If I go to VSTS, do I have the same requirement for an active server component?&nbsp; Or is a URL that is accessible to all the clients the only requirement?</P>

It's
documentation is amazing, and it is in fact a book that you can read
online or download as a pdf:<br>
<br>
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/<br>
<br>
Subversion has a series of accompanying software, such as Tortoise SVN
(which is veeery straightforward), AnkhSVN (a VS plugin that works for
2002/3/5 versions), and WebSVN or WevCV that are the web interface for
subversion.<br>
Documentation for these is not as abundant and clear, but you can set
it all up without much of a headache in a day or two (note that what
takes time is not subvesion, that could take just a few minutes if you
only care about the basics and use tortoise). For all of the latter, as
usual, google is your friend.<br>

I just installed and switched our comapny over to it (from VSS) and everyone is very&nbsp;happy.</P>
<P>I agree with both Xal and Rocky when it comes to documentation and installation of SVN. <BR>Xal is right about the documentation, it's pretty good. <BR>Rocky&nbsp;is right that it might not be the most straight forward installation, but for me it was more due to all the different options out there then lack of documentation. </P>
<P>Should you go with Apache, SVNServe or file to serve up Subversion? <BR>Should you select Filebased (FSFS) or Berkley DB for the repository?</P>
<P>My 0.02$ on repository is go FSFS now. Seems to be everyone recomendation for new installs.To serve it up option is slightly harder and depends on your situation. The most advanced and best if you want to limit access is to do Apache (also the most complicated to install and here you have watch for correct version). If you are a standalone you could go file based. I did (for now) SVNServe and it's very simple to install. You should install the SVNServer add-on so it can run as service on your 'server'. </P>
<P>If you go with FSFS and SVNServe/SVNServer the setup is very straight forward and easy. </P>
<P>You should use TortoiseSVN and ANHKSvn as you client tools to access the repository. &nbsp;</P>
<P>My big problems started&nbsp;when&nbsp;I wanted to put a Web interface on my Subversion install. I went with WebSVN and then&nbsp;I had to start&nbsp;download &nbsp;a lot of stuff and had a lot of config problems to get it to work&nbsp;(probably also since i wanted it to run under IIS).</P>

It's not as bad as it sounds, its done automagically and there are rarely conflicts that needs to be resolved. <BR>You never having the problem that the file&nbsp;you want to work on is locked by another&nbsp;user. And most of the time&nbsp;you don't have tp be worried about if someone else been touching the file when you workin a disconnected mode.</P>
<P>In subversion check-ins (or commits) are atomic. If a file doesn't make it in or if you lose connection during the commit, Subversion roles back the transaction. In vss you would have corrupted reposotiry.</P>
<P>VSS is famous for corruptions, Subversion rarely or never gets corrupted.</P>
<P>Subversion is excellent for disconnected work, vss (2005 might be better) is not good at it.</P>
<P>Subversion is very good at branching, when you have releases this very important. VSS is pretty bad at it (never tried, but everone says stay away from it).</P>
