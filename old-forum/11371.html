<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">we are using CSLA
v3.8.1.0 in a WPF application. The application is working fine when connecting
to a local dataportal (with Slovak regional settings), but when connecting to a
dataportal hosted on our dev server (with English regional settings) the
properties of the business objects are getting mixed up. I think that this is a
result of different regional/culture setting on the dev server and on my machine
that is running the WPF front end. While comparing the soap envelopes received
from the dev server and from the local instance of the data portal, I have
found out that the properties of the</span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>business object in
the response message are in a different order. Our business object has the
following properties: <b>BusinessUnitName</b>, <b>ChannelName</b>, <b>ExternalID</b>. The dev server
is returning the fields in the specified order, but the local dataportal is
returning them in this order: <b>BusinessUnitName</b>, <b>ExternalID</b>, <b>ChannelName</b>. This
is because the letter &quot;ch&quot; (from the ChannelName property) comes
after letter &quot;h&quot; in Slovak. So the WPF front end is probably
expecting the properties in Slovak order, but when connected to the dev server,
it is getting them in English order. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Is there a way to make the ordering of the
properties culture independent?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks,</p>

<p>IIRC: You will need to update Csla.Core.FieldDataManager.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
