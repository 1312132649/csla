<P>Have you set "Enable Email Notifications of forum/thread subscriptions and replies to my posts" to yes under the email tab for user setting?</P>

So worst case now is that the email service could be down for 11 hours, 59 minutes.</P>
<P>Realistically that won't be the case though, since the failure scenario has to do with the server rebooting. The CS dev guys tell me it will be fixed in CS 2.1 when that comes out. In the meantime, my recurring batch file should provide a workable interrim solution.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
