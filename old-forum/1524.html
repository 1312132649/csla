<br>
I *just* started reading the V1 of the book (Only which is available to me).<br>
<br>
In the first chapter / Applying the Logical Architecture / <a name="62"></a><a name="ch01lev3sec91C890A0B-FC91-4033-B87C-B1A9"></a>High-Scalability-Intelligent
Client<br>
<br>
I was expecting the below </span><span>logical </span><span>to </span><span></span><span>physical </span><span>model mapping:-<br>
<br>
First Physical machine:&nbsp; Presentation + UI<br>
<br>
Second Physical machine: <b><font color="#000000">Business Logic + Data Access</font></b><br>
<br>
Third Physical Machine: Data Storgage+Management<br>
<br>
But, the book surprised me by moving the "Business Logic" logical
layer to the first machine instead of second machine<br>
<br>Can anyone kindly explain why the author has taken this decision? or point to me a location where this is already address or discussed.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

This is the goal the data portal in CSLA .NET, and to do this I am using the concept of mobile objects.<br><br>The idea is to keep the processing as physically close to any required resource as is possible. So when the object needs to interact with the user (a resource), the closer the object can get to the user the better. Similarly, when the object needs to interact with the database (another resource), the closer the object can get to the database the better.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
