<P>I have since moved to a different assignment and we have the need to do something like this:</P>
<P>Order.OrderDetails.Add(OrderDetail.NewOrderDetail());</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What is the best way to "hook" into this process and initialize some values on the OrderDetail object AFTER it has a reference to its parent object.&nbsp; For example, I want to traverse up my parent tree and get the key from the Order object to set that on my child.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance,</P>

<P>HTH</P>

<P>However, I think you can override either InsertItem() or OnAddingNew() to hook into the process of the item being added to the list. </P>
<P>I vaguely recall&nbsp;difficulties with trying to supply&nbsp;the new object using OnAddingNew(), so&nbsp;I create the item in AddNewCore() and do additional property setting in InsertItem()</P>
