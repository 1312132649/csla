<P><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">CSLA .NET for Windows</A></P>
<P><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslalight/download.aspx">CSLA .NET for Silverlight</A></P>
<P>This release includes some bug fixes to both versions, and some enhancements to the Navigator component for Silverlight.</P>
<P>I've also spent a lot of time adding in code documentation comments. We chose not to do commenting while doing the coding (because that reduces flexibility during the dev process), which means I started with around 800 items to document. I'm down to less than half that now, but it is still a big task!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, November 02, 2008</h2><P>I'll reply to myself to answer a few questions before I get them.</P>
<P>First, <STRONG>ProjectTracker is now in the Samples download</STRONG>, not the framework download. I separated them to keep the download sizes manageable, and because the Samples download now includes all the other samples too.</P>
<P>Second, <STRONG>the VB download doesn't build.</STRONG> This is the community effort that is underway to port the C# 3.6 changes to VB, and the group working on it is definately making progress. Still, it is only part way done, and the current code doesn't build.</P>
<P>Third, <STRONG>I don't have a specific final release date for 3.6.</STRONG> The current code is pretty stable, and I encourage you to try it. But as you can see, there were some bugs in Beta 2, and I'll give Beta 2a a week or two to see if the bug reporting goes down. If bug reporting fades to a trickle, or stops, then I'll do a release candidate.</P>
<P>I do <EM>hope</EM> to have a final release by mid-November, but I won't rush it if there are issues.</P>
<P>Fourth, <STRONG>CSLA .NET for Windows 3.6 does require .NET 3.5 SP1.</STRONG> But SP1 is really only required for a couple context manager classes in Csla.Data. So you can build this under 3.5 (pre-SP1) by simply commenting out a couple classes.</P>
<P>Fifth, <STRONG>CSLA .NET for Windows does support the Client Profile.</STRONG> You need to set a compiler directive to prevent compilation of items not available in the client profile, such as ASP.NET support. But you should be able to create a Csla.dll that works fine in the new Client Profile for .NET 3.5 SP1.</P>
<P>Sixth, <STRONG>the Expert C# 2008 Business Objects book is nearing completion.</STRONG> I'm about 50% done with the final chapter review. Apress says they'll soon have PDF preview chapters&nbsp;online&nbsp; at <A href="http://www.apress.com">www.apress.com</A>, and we should still be on track for the book to be available in December.</P>
<P>Seventh, <STRONG>work on Expert VB 2008 Business Objects has started.</STRONG> Joe Fallon (you've probably seen many of his posts here) is doing the meticulous work of porting the chapters from C# to VB. The primary thing we'll probably have to wait for is the port of the framework itself from C# to VB. But we're looking at a February release for the VB book at this point in time.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
