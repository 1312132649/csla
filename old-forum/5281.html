It sounds like something is going wrong there..<br /><br />You can still bind the UltraWebGrid to your datasource at run-time, by either using the DataSourceID, or setting the DataSource property to the DataSource's DataSourceView object.  Just be sure to set that in the WebGrid's InitializeDataSource event.<br /><br />-Tony<br /><br />Anthony Lombardo<br />Developer Evangelist<br />Infragistics, Inc.<br />www.infragistics.com</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
