Perhaps you could write a control that accepted the command and then routed it to other controls on the form? </P>
<P>Then have the button send the command to this "router" control, which would route the command to all your data provider controls.</P>
<P>You'd have to figure out how to associate the data provider controls with this router - which is certainly possible, though I don't know the solution off the top of my head.</P>
<P>A simpler solution is to not use commanding, but rather to use a click event handler in code-behind and just call Save() on all your data provider controls. Easy to do, but not as elegant <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
