<p>please assume you have users and group.<br />Each user can be a member of many groups.<br /><br />The UI should display the users details and a list of referenced groups.<br />Additionally it has to be possible to remove selected groups,<br />and to add a group selected by a separate combo-box containing available groups.</p>
<p>My idea was to create the following stereotypes<br />&nbsp;- UserEdit as EditableRoot Object<br />&nbsp;- GroupList as Editable Child List<br />&nbsp;- GroupInfo as Read-Only Child Object</p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems that an EditableChildList cannot contain Read-Only Child objects.<br />What do I miss here?<br />Why has the Group object to be an editable object? I only want to display informations of it.<br />Only the referencing list has to be modified, but not the containing elements.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />Alexander</p>

<pre style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:13px;color:black;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% #fafafa;"><span style="color:#2baaaf;">ISupportUndo</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2baaaf;">IUndoableObject</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2baaaf;">ITrackStatus</span>
</pre>
<p>IE: Can participate in N-Level undo and keeps track of whether they are dirty or not. </p>
<p>ReadOnly objects do NOT implement these interfaces and cannot be used in an editable list. </p>
<p>You do NOT only want to display information - you must also know whether item status is IsDeleted, IsNew og none (existing). </p>
<p>And the list has an &quot;owning&quot; reference to all it&#39;s child objects - so they CANNOT be owned by multiple lists in order to participate in N-Level undo.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
