<p>&quot;Data binding (especially in Windows Forms, which I assume you are using) imposes a whole other set of requirements. CSLA 4 helps somewhat with these, by enabling multiple bindingsource objects to bind to the same object <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">in some cases.</span></strong> That wasn&#39;t possible prior to CSLA 4, because the IEditableObject implementation got confused.&quot;</p>

<p>Does anybody know the &quot;cases&quot; in which this is supported IN CSLA 4?</p>
<p>Is this something that could be easily ported to 3.8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, October 26, 2011</h2><p>Hi, </p>
<p>It&#39;s possible so long as you never call BeginEdit/EndEdit/CancelEdit on an object that is databound. This also means that you cannot use the CslaActionExtender as this assumes ownership of the BO and will Bind/Unbind the object on its own. </p>
<p>You can look at the actual changes I did for 4.0 here: <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslabugs/edit_bug.aspx?id=241">http://www.lhotka.net/cslabugs/edit_bug.aspx?id=241</a></p>
<p>We have no plans to backport this into Csla 3.8 (at present). A</p>
<p>You should however probably only need to change:</p>
<p><i>Csla/BusinessListBase.cs</i> and <br /><i>Csla/Core/BusinessBase.cs</i></p>
<p>And you should focus on the  changes in implementation of <i>IEditableObject </i>and <i>#region Begin/Cancel/ApplyEdit</i> methods.</p>

<p>Really impressed with the&nbsp;community. Hopefully I can someday help newbies in&nbsp;the&nbsp;manner I have been.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
