<br><p class="MsoNormal">I think this is the nature of framework adoption, and is one
reason I've been hesitant to get serious about creating a commercial version of
CSLA .NET. There are various commercial frameworks out there, and they seem to
do OK, but not great.<br>
<br>It is a rare thing to run into people using these frameworks at actual
companies. I don't know that this is a commentary on the frameworks, as much as
those companies are risk-averse. If a company builds its own framework
(expensive as that is), or avoids using a framework entirely (which imo is more
expensive), they avoid tying themselves to a vendor in a very intimate manner.<br>
<br>
Frameworks are merged directly into applications such that the result in inseparable.
If the framework becomes untenable, so does the app. If the framework vendor
disappears, most likely the framework does too...<br>
<br>
Sure, you can put the framework code in escrow, and anyone buying a framework
would be very foolish not to do this. But can you staff assume ownership of
that framework, even given the source code, in the case that the vendor is
gone? There's a lot of risk there.<br>
<br>
I think there's arguably less risk with a framework like CSLA, where the source
code is available without the effort of escrow. And where there's a broader
community of people who understand the framework, adapt it to their needs and
use it in their projects within the context of an open community forum.<br>
<br>
Still, you can't deny that there's an element of risk involved.<br>
<br>
Personally I think the benefits outweigh those risks - at least with something
like CSLA. The productivity and maintainability benefits alone are tremendous,
and the code is open and documented in a publicly available book, which should
help offset much of the aforementioned risk.<br>
<br>
But then there's the "not built here" technical hurdle too. What I've
been talking about thus far is a management concern. But from a technical
level, there are a lot of people who simply dislike using or relying on other
people's code. That's a hard hurdle to overcome in some cases.<br>
<br>
Personally I was in that camp for a period of time early in my career. But on
the VAX there were the DECUS tapes, which were full of really cool tools and
code and ideas. And on the Amiga there was the Fred Fish collection - same
thing. The utility of the contributions available through those channels
eventually convinced me that it was worth using code not built here - at least
from time to time :)<br>
<br>
And then there's the "philosophical disagreement" hurdle. If you
believe with all your heart that client/server, n-tier and OO are all dead;
replaced by SOA - then CSLA would violate your core beliefs in a way that would
be hard to reconcile. Other examples exist as well of course. People fixate on
SOA, the DataSet, data transfer objects, workflow - all sorts of technology
concepts that they can view as excluding OO, and thus CSLA.<br>
<br>
I've discussed this before, and I'm OK with it. People have to pursue their
passions. I think there's a place and time for all these technology concepts,
and that none of them (including OO) is the right answer for every problem. I
just happen to think that OO tends to fit into niches within almost all the
other concepts - it is a great way to implement a service, or a workflow task.
It is really powerful when used to construct the client app that front-ends a service-oriented
system. And anywhere you are applying OO to create business apps, I think you
can apply CSLA .NET to make your life easier.</p>So maybe more marketing would help. But even for-profit companies that have dedicated marketing people have a hard time getting broad usage of their frameworks.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
