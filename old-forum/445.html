[assembly: AssemblyVersion("2.0.0.0")]<br>
<br>
When I compile the application, it says it builds successfully,<br>
and there are no errors, warnings or messages.<br>
However, if I open the App.Config file I get a number of warnings and messages as follows:<br>
<br>
<br>
Warnings<br>
The 'requirePermission' attribute is not declared.<br>
<br>
<br>
Messages<br>
Could not find schema information for the element 'applicationSettings'.<br>
Could not find schema information for the element 'Csla.Properties.Settings'.<br>
Could not find schema information for the element 'setting'.<br>
Could not find schema information for the attribute 'name'.<br>
Could not find schema information for the attribute 'serializeAs'.<br>
Could not find schema information for the element 'value'.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was able to resolove the Warning by replacing the DotNetConfig.xsd file<br>
located here "\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Xml\Schemas"<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
I do not see how to fix the "Messages"<br>
<br>
<br>
I have the same problem in the VB version of CSLA<br>
There are several more "Messages" --- 18 in all<br>
<br>
<br>
Any help resolving these two would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Lastly, why do the warnings and messages only appear when I open the App.Config file?<br>
It seems to me they should show up even when all VS - IDE windows are closed.<br>
<br>
TIA<br>
