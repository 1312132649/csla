<p>I upgrade a .NET 2.0 and CSLA 3.8 Projekt to .NET 4.0 and CSLA 4. I&#39;ve got a BO with a child-collection bound to a bindingsource. Via a button new elements could be added to the child collection. OK so far and unchanged.</p>
<p>But other than before, the Datagrid which is bound to the child-BS doesn&#39;t show the new data, which is definitly added.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>Thx &amp; kind regards</p>

<p>Did you change your lists to inherit from BusinessBindingList/ReadOnlyBindingList etc.</p>
<p>Default lists in CSLA 4 now inherits from ObservableList that has different events (and does not work as expected with WinForms controls) and the &quot;old&quot; BindingList base classes is renamed. </p>

<p>that exactly was the reason! (and an easy fix <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" />)</p>
<p>Thanks a lot...</p>
