<P>However, a lot of MVC implementation make an assumption (a poor one imo) that the Model is passive. That it is composed of objects that contain no logic, and just have public read/write properties.</P>
<P>Which is really sad, given that the Model is the most obvious and logical place for all your logic. CSLA helps you build a Model that does contain all your logic.</P>
<P>So my only word of caution is to be careful when looking at MVC or MVP to make sure you don't lose the ability to encapsulate all your logic in the Model, or the ability to create a rich, interactive user experience (assuming you are using Windows Forms or WPF) without duplicating things like validation logic into the View or Controller.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
