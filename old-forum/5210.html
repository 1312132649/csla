I read somewhere rocky saying that you didn't intend to continue with it but it didn't have a reason for this. Was it because the BatchQueue had a design flaw in it or was it just something that you didn't want in the framework any more?<BR><BR>The reason why I ask is that I have had a need come from the business to schedule batch processes to run, etc and not that I have looked through the BatchQueue to see exactly what it does but from the sounds of it this could be very useful. Hence why I am wondering about it.<BR><BR>Cheers<BR>Anthony<o:p></o:p></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Friday, August 08, 2008</h2><P>I think it was a question of time and space&nbsp; - i.e. not enough of it to fit in the next book.</P>
<P>The BatchQueue&nbsp;project&nbsp;was an example how to reuse the business objects to create a batch reporting solution if memory servers me correctly.&nbsp; It's been awhile.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, August 08, 2008</h2>CommandBase allows you to pretty easily build your own BatchQueue type system as well.. <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, August 08, 2008</h2><P>Time, space, and the reality that things like PowerShell and other technologies (WF?) probably do a better job.</P>
<P>CSLA has become so big and complex by itself, that there was no way I could <EM>also</EM> do justice to a full batch queuing system. So it was either keep the BatchQueue and let it slowly become laughable due to lack of time to keep it up to date, or drop it and be honest.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vdhant replied on Saturday, August 09, 2008</h2>No thats fine.. just wondering. <br>Thanks for the response.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
