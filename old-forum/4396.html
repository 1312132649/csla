<P>I hope the Xceed grid 2.0 has the support. I also own the Infragistics set but I am just getting started using CSLA so I'll let you know how that goes. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GeorgeG replied on Thursday, March 06, 2008</h2>There is something on the web that MS will release a wpf datagrid in summer.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Thursday, March 06, 2008</h2><P>I've done a few experiments with Xceed's WPF DataGrid 2 and it looks like it doesn't support the IDataErrorInfo interface <img src="/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad [:(]" /></P>
<P>I have also heard about Microsoft coming out this year with a WPF grid.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GeorgeG replied on Friday, March 07, 2008</h2>Probably we will re-shuffle the projects around and wait for the wpf ones. Hope by then 3rd party vendors will update their grids.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Paul Czywczynski replied on Friday, March 07, 2008</h2><br>I heard an upcoming Xceed release will have it. I am sure the MS grid will have it as well but you're probably looking late this year until MS releases it. Even then Xceed will have more features since MS controls are basic and mostly just set a baseline for functionality.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Atopper replied on Tuesday, September 16, 2008</h2>Has anyone tried the&nbsp;CodePlex WPF&nbsp;datagrid with CSLA?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Turntwo replied on Tuesday, October 21, 2008</h2>I'm using Infragisitics XamDataGrid and it is working pretty well.&nbsp; I managed to bind it to the CslaDataProvider and insert, update, and delete are all working.&nbsp; Still working on the validation part however (the Save button disables when invalid data is entered, but no indication in the XamDataGrid of what the error is).&nbsp; <br><br>I also tried Xceed, but wasn't having much luck with the data binding aspect.&nbsp; <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, October 22, 2008</h2>The grid doesn't support IDataErrorInfo, but <a href="http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2008/05/15/sample-series-idataerrorinfo-and-the-infragistics-xamdatagrid/">this page</a> shows one solution.<br><br>I'm not totally happy with this solution; if it's possible for one item into the grid to not only invalidate itself, but another item, the other item won't get the error indicator because it works on the EndingCellEdit event, or whatever it's called.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
