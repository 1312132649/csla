<P>My BOs expose some&nbsp;namevalue lists as&nbsp; properties that i bind a comboBox dartasource property to, However the act of binding the datasource alters the SelectedValue property which is not desirable. Having traced the databinding process I can see the SelectedValue binding then the DataSource binding which alters the SelectedValue. </P>
<P>Anyone have any ideas as to how I should be doing this properly</P>
<P>Regards</P>

<P>The binding on the combobox will automatically select the first item. The subsequent initialization of binding to your business object should reset it to the value displayed on combo to the property of the&nbsp;BO it is associated with.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>simon_may replied on Wednesday, November 19, 2008</h2><P>I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that that is the root of the problem. The ComboBox's bindings bind the SelectedValue and the Datasource to the BOs bindingsource because if the BO is a child there may well be no instance for the comboBox to bind to (the subsidiary datasource that binds the child collection), and therefore there is &nbsp;no NameValueList property for me to explicitly bind the ComboBox&nbsp;datasource to. Data binding handles this situation without complaining, and that is why I tried to do it this way. If the order of binding was logical i.e. the datasource then the SelectedValue then there would be no problem. </P>
<P>Am I the only person that wants this sort of &nbsp;functionality or is my design fundametally wrong</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
