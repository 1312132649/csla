<p>Has someone faced the same scenario and what would be the recommended approach?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, April 10, 2012</h2><p>Sounds like you have another use-case and should create separate objects - and not use inheritance. </p>

<p>thinking it over :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
