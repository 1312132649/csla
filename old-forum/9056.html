<p>I&#39;m now undertaking a winform app, and I&#39;ve never written a winform app w/ CSLA where I&#39;ve done any unit testing (it&#39;s been a long time since I did a large winform app).</p>
<p>Is there any benefit to using MVC or MVP with my winform app when it comes to unit testing?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Unlike webforms, with winforms I <strong>think</strong> my unit test <strong>can</strong> just instantiate my forms and do things like click buttons and whatever, unlike with webforms.</p>
<p>The binding in winforms is also much tighter than with webforms, so I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll have lots more DataSource = X, and less view.txtLasntNameText = x.Last.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping that someone (or maybe a few people) here are doing winforms with CSLA, DataBinding and unit tests and can give me some advice as to the best path to take.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
