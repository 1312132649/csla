<p>For that reason I wish far more effort was placed on easing the use of HTML 5 front ends and far less on WinRT but perhaps I just don&#39;t understand something fundamental here.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, July 03, 2012</h2><p>We&#39;ve got a fairly substantial investment in a CSLA Silverlight application that is in production.&nbsp; The effectiveness of the Silverlight application, in no way, can be touched by an HTML5 application with the same level of effort that had been expended to date.</p>
<p>That said, I am highly unlikely to be advocating for a WinRT application anytime soon.&nbsp; I will definitely be prototyping certain things, but we need to see good adoption of not just Windows 8 but in my opinion the Windows 8 ARM devices in order to make a legitimate case for a WinRT application.</p>
<p>The irony is that I see our Silverlight application really on the road to becoming our desktop application - we lose cross-platform/cross-browser capabilities moving from Silverlight to WinRT, we don&#39;t gain them.&nbsp; Really hoping windows 8 tablets take off.&nbsp; If the don&#39;t, we&#39;ll have to do an HTML5 app.&nbsp; However, I think we&#39;re at a period of time where wait-and-see is the most prudent choice.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#39;d say that we, in our situation, max 4-5 years before we have to pull the trigger.&nbsp; In those 4-5 years I&#39;m hoping a productive development platform emerges that has enough acceptable reach- ideally one that leverages our CSLA objects and isn&#39;t html/javascript.&nbsp; I&#39;m mildly skeptical that this happens.</p>
<p>One thing that has impressed me to some degree is a couple 3rd parties out there that allow the iPAD to run Silverlight applications.&nbsp; My boss pointed me to a second one that supposedly works totally fine on his iPAD.&nbsp; The delivery of the application in certain respects could prolong usability of our applications beyond the 2021 non-support, as it delivers the application in more of an image-oriented manner / it takes away the fact that Silverlight doesn&#39;t run on the iPAD.&nbsp; Speed is apparently not a problem and as bandwidth inevitably gets even better on average, it should continue to be even less of an issue.&nbsp; Whether the 3rd parties last is a whole separate question.</p>
<p>For now, at least, I&#39;m in a wait and see mode for WinRT as I&#39;ve got tons of legacy VB6 functionality to get into .NET and plenty to do. (We have a very hybrid-type application at present).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Tuesday, July 03, 2012</h2><p>I assume by &quot;writing native WinRT apps using CSLA&quot; you mean C#/VB, XAML and CSLA, correct? &nbsp;Not just CSLA alone? &nbsp; I can think of a couple of reasons to continue to build upon these skills. &nbsp;Among them, it provides a relatively easy path into the WinRT development world using what you already know.</p>
<p>That said, I&#39;d say there are some good reasons to become more proficient in HTML5 since it would give you broader reach for browser-based scenarios beyond just WinRT.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Thursday, July 05, 2012</h2><p>Interesting.&nbsp; Anyone?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
