<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>I use such a contact-class in my order BOs for loading locations, freight rate payers, carriers, and so on. Otherwise I had to repeat the contact properties more than ten times. So it really keeps the object structure clean. But I had one issue: In a collection of such structured objects it was not possible for me to bind properties of the contacts to a Component One grid. Something like “Contact.Name” was&nbsp;not valid as a data source…</SPAN></P>

I use the following method of Component One’s TrueDataGrid to bind my collections to the grid:</P>
<P>Overloads Public Sub SetDataBinding(ByVal dataSource As Object, ByVal dataMember As String, ByVal holdFields As Boolean)</P>
<P>So I call something like that:</P>
<P>MyGrid.SetDataBinding (myCollection, “MyCollectionsPropertie”, True)</P>
<P>I’m not very familiar with data binding in .NET 2.0 yet. I still use the BindField-Helper-method from Rocky’s old book. Sooner or later I must buy a good .NET-2.0-Windows-Forms-book…</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, August 04, 2006</h2>The binding source is actually a very easy control to use.&nbsp; Basically you create a project data source, and set that to be the data source of the binding source.&nbsp; Then your controls bind to the binding source (and can see the properties available on your object).<br><br>When your form loads, you set the data source of the binding source to the actual object when you want to display.&nbsp; Its very easy, much easier than trying to code it all up.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
