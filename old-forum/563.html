<P>I'm pretty sure this has been discussed before, like here - <A HREF="/forums/thread/2102.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/2102.aspx</A>&nbsp;- but I don't quite get it yet.</P>
<P>Let's say you have an OrderHeader (customer name, billing info etc.), that has two OrderItems associated with it. OrderItem #1 is a pair of jeans, OrderItem #2 is a T-shirt with a custom message printed on it.</P>
<P>In this example, the custom message is specific to that OrderItem, and never applies to a pair of jeans, sunglasses or other product items.</P>
<P>How do you design your OrderItem class(es?) to take into account extra information that is specific to a product item?</P>
<P>I'm pretty lost as to the class design as well as the database structure.</P>
<P>Any thoughts appreciated,</P>

So an Order has a collection of LineItem, and a LineItem has a collection of DetailItem.</P>
<P>Then if you have polymorphic LineItem types (<A href="http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=b8515cd9-7f8e-43df-9efd-cd958dfdc21a">http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=b8515cd9-7f8e-43df-9efd-cd958dfdc21a</A>), each line item class can enforce its own rules about what (if any) detail items are allowed.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
