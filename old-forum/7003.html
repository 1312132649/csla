<P>Csla.Reflection.CallMethodException: NewTestObject method call failed --&gt; Could not find default endpoint element that references contract 'WcfPortal.IWcfPortal' in the ServiceModel client configuration section.</P>
<P>I did not modify any of the demo's svc files or Web.Config file.&nbsp; I looked at the values and they seem to be fine.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 26, 2009</h2>Check to make sure the references to Csla.dll are correct in all the projects. It sounds like the web project is missing that reference, which probably means Visual Studio was unable to find the DLL on your hard drive.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ninoarena replied on Tuesday, May 26, 2009</h2><P>Thanks for the prompt reply.&nbsp; I checked all my references and they seems to be all in place.&nbsp; I can rebuild the whole solution without a hitch but when I run the application,&nbsp;I&nbsp;still get the&nbsp;error.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 26, 2009</h2>I re-read the text you provided. It refers to the <EM>client</EM> configuration file, not server. So that seems to indicate a problem in ServiceReferences.clientconfig in the Silverlight app itself, or that the Csla.dll reference in that project isn't correct?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ninoarena replied on Tuesday, May 26, 2009</h2>Could this be caused by Silverlight 3 because the machine I am using has Silverlight 3 installed?&nbsp; Demo001, 002, 003 all worked fine so I thought that Silverlight 3 would be okay&nbsp;for Demo004 as well.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
