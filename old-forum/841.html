<P>There are acually three List&lt;T&gt; properties and we have a custom rule saying that the object is not valid if none of the three properties contains any strings.&nbsp; A BLB object does not feel right because the list is so simple - it has no key info or any fields other then the one simple string.&nbsp; The IsValid override is an interesting thought, but I am not sure if it is better than our approach.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, August 08, 2006</h2>Can you use BindingList&lt;T&gt; instead of List&lt;T&gt;? At least that way your list would automatically implement normal binding behavior and the ListChanged event.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
