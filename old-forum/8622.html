<p>I have switched some of my code to use the BindingSourceHelper, I now have an issue with DataGridViews bound to child BLB properties.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve implemented AddNewCore so new rows can be added to the grid, previously when I hit escape on a new grid row the row would be removed, after moving to using&nbsp; BindingSourceHelper the row remains after i cancel the edit. Cancelling edits to existing rows works fine.</p>
<p>This only seems to be a problem with child properties, I&#39;ve tired the same thing with a root BLB object and the added rows are removed as expected.</p>
<p>Is this a bug or have I missed something?</p>
<p>All help gratefully received,</p>
<p>Adam</p>
