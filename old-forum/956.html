<P>In a current job I am working on, I desire to protect my code from disassembly (especially by the client).</P>
<P>I am wondering if any of you have used and can recommend a particular obfuscation package. I would also like to hear if anyone is currently using any form of licensensing for their software and how they are achieving this.</P>
<P>I understand the pros/cons of obfuscation, but am in a situation with this client that would make obfuscation extremely useful.</P>
<P>Grateful thanks in advance,</P>

However, I can say that CSLA doesn't work with obfuscation unless you make a few changes. Specifically anywhere reflection is used to call a method by name will fail, because obfuscators change names. You'll need to alter at least the data portal to be interface-based to make this work - but other changes may be required in a few places as well.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
