<p>So you have a 1:1 relationship on these business objects?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it is up to your data access code to re-initilalize the child object with a new object after the Delete.</p>
<p>If it was a parent-list-child it would be handled correctly by the list.&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
