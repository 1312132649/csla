<P>I am new to CSLA and still learning the basics. With validation in CSLA.NET we write something like this in property procedures for a Business Object</P>
<P>BrokenRules.Assert("Name","Name Required", Len(value)=0)</P>
<P>This works great. However, how can we do validate one property against the other. For instance if I want to check Gender with DateOfBirth i.e. If both are missing then the Business Object should be invalid. How and where can we do such validations?</P>
<P>Help much appreciated</P>

<P>It was helpful thanks. However, it does not discuss (may be directly) the issue I have.</P>
<P>May be you can clarify. I have two properties in BO. Before saving them I need to validate one against the other. Within the property procedure of each, I can't put that. Why? Because unless user presses 'Save' button that rule should not be invoked.</P>

If you track this call you will see that this maintains the valid-state of your BO. <br><br>Also, in the base classes in Csla the Save routine checks the validity before actually committing the change. If the BO is not in a valid state an exception is thrown.<br><br>In the ProjectTracker sample you can find examples of BOs that make use of validation and also on <a href="http://www.onelittlevictory.com">One&nbsp; Little Victory</a> you can find more info.<br><br>Bayu<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Monday, April 02, 2007</h2><P>I am assuming that you are doing something along the lines of a StartDate/EndDate scenario where the EndDate value has to be greater than the StartDate in order to be valid.&nbsp; You can find an example of how to do this in the ProjectTracker sample app (check the latest version).</P>
<P>HTH</P>
