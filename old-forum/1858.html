<P>Questions, questions....thanks for any thoughts on these.&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, November 28, 2006</h2><P>Many developers use things like the DAAB in their DataPortal regions.</P>
<P>My DAL looks a lot like the MS DAAB and it reduces the amount of code in the DP quite a bit.</P>
<P>It increases the readability too.</P>
<P>My Codesmith templates were tweaked to use my DAL instead of directly spitting out the ADO.Net code.</P>

<P>I'm not even to the point of considering utilizing codegen utilities with CSLA until I come up to speed on using the framework manually, but I do want to know what's around the corner.&nbsp; I already own CodeSmith so it's nice to hear that many folks are using it successfully with the framework...although it looks like there&nbsp;are healthy debates going on between the ORM/UML camps and what the best tools to use for codegen might be.&nbsp; Thanks again.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
