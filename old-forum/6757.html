The editable child is a managed field. <br /><br />I've looked at the EditableRootParent.cs template, but my scenario differs in that the child is not created right away. <br /><br />The editable child can be instantiated after its parent is loaded/created and here is where I have the problem. When I try saving, my edit levels are off. <br /><br />Looking into the framework code, I see in LoadProperty where the editlevels are synched. <br /><br />e.g.<br /><br /> if (child != null)<br />          {<br />            child.SetParent(this);<br />            // set child edit level<br />            UndoableBase.ResetChildEditLevel(child, this.EditLevel, this.BindingEdit);<br />            // reset EditLevelAdded <br />            child.EditLevelAdded = this.EditLevel;<br />            // hook child event<br />            //INotifyPropertyChanged pc = (INotifyPropertyChanged)newValue;<br />            //pc.PropertyChanged += new PropertyChangedEventHandler(Child_PropertyChanged);<br />          }<br /><br />But I don't believe the "SetProperty" has this, and I don't have access to these properties from my class. Is there a way I can sync the edit levels from my class?<br /><br />Thx.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh Boy...guess long day. I guess I could just use LoadProperty instead of SetProperty :) I was thinking Load did a "read", and set a "Put", but they both do "Put"s</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
