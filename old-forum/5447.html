<P>Can anybody help in this. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Thursday, September 25, 2008</h2>Is anybody facing similar problem like this ? As this is happenning quite frequently and error is thrown due to some internal serializing&nbsp;operation of CSLA.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, September 25, 2008</h2><P>Sounds like you have some references which should be marked as NonSerialized. Make sure you do not have any "infinite loops" in terms of references.</P>
