Thus...<br /><br />Person.Addresses (master liist)<br />Person.HomeAddresses<br />Person.WorkAddresses<br /><br />I suppose probably it might be better if it existed in the ROLB since the actual business logic of differentiating addresses between work and home would be more appropriately done by the address collection looking at the addresses within the collection.<br /><br />My usage is a bit more brief than the probably more proper way: Person.Addresses.HomeAddresses<br /><br />In the end it's probably not too huge a deal, but that's my take. </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
