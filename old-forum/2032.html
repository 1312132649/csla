I have been a Web Developer all these days and our organization intends to implement CSLA.NET on an upcoming project and I have been assigned the task of developing a prototype application using the CSLA.NET framework. I have already understood the ProjectTracker sample application that comes along with the framework and would like to look into some more sample apps before I can really get started with my prototype. <br><br>Please let me know the links of such sample apps available on the web. <br><br>Also, can someone explain what these Active Objects (for CSLA.NET) are and their objective?<br><br>Thanks in advance. <br><br>Shashi Kumar<br></font></font></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
