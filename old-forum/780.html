<P>When a user changes the State, the County list needs to update for that row only.&nbsp; Each row can have a different State, hence a different County list.</P>
<P>Any help is greatly appreciated.</P>

<P>1 -&nbsp;Have separate lists objects for each state available.&nbsp; Too awful to discuss further.</P>
<P>2 - Query the database for the county list with an input parameter for the State selected in the current row.&nbsp; Also hideous.</P>
<P>3 - Have one list object&nbsp;that contains&nbsp;all the counties with their states - but it is Filterable.&nbsp; Just change the filter to match the context of the current row.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sure, there will be a lot of rows - but not&nbsp;SO many rows that performance should suffer.&nbsp; How many counties are there?&nbsp; 4000?&nbsp; 3000?&nbsp; I think the median number of counties per state must be something on the order of 40 or 50.&nbsp; But we have over 250 here in Texas (but you should still resist the temptation to make us a separate list object &lt;grin&gt;).&nbsp; You may even be able to shorten the list if you can do something creative to manage duplicates.&nbsp; There must be&nbsp;MANY instances of names like Jefferson, Washington, Green, Brown, and other names from history and general popular use (yes, even Johnson &lt;g&gt;).&nbsp; If you could flatten the collection to contain only one row for each of those you might save 10%&nbsp;to 30%, I would guess.&nbsp; You'd have to&nbsp;work out&nbsp;an interesting filtering algorithm, but it&nbsp;is probably&nbsp;doable.</P>
<P>Good luck!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
