You should look at it from a use case point of view not from&nbsp;your class hierarchy.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curtmantle replied on Thursday, September 11, 2008</h2>Thanks. In the example I'm thinking of, it is conceptually a root object.<br><br>The problem I was having was one of not being clear whether there is a technical reason within CSLA to mark it as a child, to ensure the relationship was maintained. However, as the "parent" is wrapped, I can ensure it's being updated and not being presented to the public interface - but I wanted to check.<br><br>I need to look up what marking an object as a child does in technical terms within CSLA really.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triplea replied on Thursday, September 11, 2008</h2><P>Well the book would be the best guide, I wouldn't even attempt to list the reasons. But it also depends what version of CSLA you are using. In CSLA 3.5 there are a lot of enhancements that really reduce a lot of repetitive code and make the relationship more distinctive.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, September 11, 2008</h2>Usually a child object is one that you cannot call Save directly on; it's up to it's parent object to ask it to save, usually through an internal only method, or in 3.5, via a Child_Update or Child_Insert data portal method.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
