<p>If I make them Application settings, they can all see and use the values, but they can&#39;t change them.&nbsp; And if I make them User settings, which they CAN change, then they are only visible to&nbsp;the specific user and I want them to have All User scope.</p>
<p>Users who install our product on a workstation don&#39;t mind filling out the settings once and going forward with their own unique setup.&nbsp; But I&#39;ve got a client running this on a citrix server and they think it&#39;s a big deal to have to re-enter the values for each user that is going to acces the program.&nbsp; And I kind of agree with them.&nbsp; Isn&#39;t there some EASY way to have the users get and set this settings data?&nbsp; Or must I resort to writing and parsing a custom text file saved in the AllUsers Application Data folder or, worse still, adding yet another table to the database to hold these values that everyone will be using?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

I haven&#39;t looked deeply at that stuff for many years, but I&#39;m pretty sure you can have multiple config files, in different places, or even in a database, and still have everything available through the standard config API.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Friday, April 08, 2011</h2><p>We store every possible setting we can in the database itself and use business objects to back them.&nbsp; There is only one setting we don&#39;t store in the db and that&#39;s the connection string.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
