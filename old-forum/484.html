<P>I have a BusinessListBase (EmployeeEditableRootList) that has a collection of BusinessBase objects (EmployeeEditableChild).</P>
<P>I have NOT overridden IsDirty on the parent. Yet I edit a child record, and IsDirty on the parent is true, but EditLevel is still zero.</P>
<P>I thought I would have to override IsDirty in the parent class, but I guess not. Also, should I be wiring up something so the parent's EditLevel gets incremented?</P>
<P>I guess I don't understand how things are working/should be working.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
