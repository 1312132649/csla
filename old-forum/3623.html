Normally I prefer a something that is more of a reference, where I can look up facts quickly, but this is an enjoyable read. Others may find it too basic, and much of the OO principals were hardly new to me, but the discussions around why a pattern was a good idea, despite sometimes appearing to be over complicated, I found very useful. It is Java-based, however, which may not suit, but tbh if you can read c# or vb.net then Java is straight-forward.<br><br>The original gang of four book (Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Gamma et al.) is still a valid reference, though not quite so easy to digest, and not exactly the complete story - things have moved on a little since this was published.<br><br>For me, when I need a reference, I tend to use the web, especially the dofactory site - quick to search and to the point.<br><br>HTH, The Professor.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bassplayer replied on Tuesday, October 02, 2007</h2>Professional Design Patterns in VB.NET:<br>Building Adaptable Applications<br><br>By Tom Fischer, John Slater, Peter Stromquist, &amp; Chaur G.
