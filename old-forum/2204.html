<P>I know this is a CSLA forum (and believe me - this IS a CSLA project), but I've tried the Microsoft website, and googling but I cannot find an answer anywhere.</P>
<P>All of a sudden, my solution (2 projects) do not compile because the references to dlls they previously had are missing...</P>
<P>So, thinking I can just remove and add the references again, I do just that. But in my list of references, regardless of how I add them... (either through the specified reference types COM, etc.. or Browse..), under the "Path" column it says "&lt;The system cannot find the reference specified&gt;"</P>
<P>The references in question are:-</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft TAPI 3.0 Type Library</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Basic for Applications</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Basic runtime objects and proecedures</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; and a 3rd party control VLButtonBar.</P>
<P>Everything was fine yesterday, and I am totally hung out to dry, am unable to compile, release or publish.</P>
<P>The only thing that I have changed recently is an attempt at using CS-RCS (sourcec-control) which I later abandoned... surely that wouldn;t have an effect?</P>
<P>Anyone had this problem, or know what I can do?</P>
<P>Desperately,</P>
<P>Gaj.</P>

<P>Sorry to waste your times...</P>
<P>Turns out the install of CS-RCS - and subsequent uninstall, rendered many, many, many of my files 'read only'. I simply removed the read-only attributes recursively in my development folder et voila! I can now add my references - I guess it was trying to create an Interop.xxx.dll and it was being denied.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
