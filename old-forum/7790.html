I tried many ways of handling bindingsources but I could not find a good soution for it. Actually n-Level Undo is not an easy task in Windows forms anyway. It may be improved in later versions but&nbsp; I wonder if anyone has a solution for it now.?<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, October 15, 2009</h2>Hi, <br><br>I would not recommend to use CslaActionExtender in Modal forms. I prefer to control the Bind/Unbind process and N-level undo manually in Modal forms. <br><br>I also prefer to set DialogResult in code - so that the user can remain in the form if save fails rather than always closing the form as CslaActionExtender does not set any DialogResult.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>saeedsamie replied on Friday, October 16, 2009</h2>Hi JonnyBee<br><br>Thanks for your recommendation. I actually have a root BusinessBase which have a Child List which I want to be changed by user whenever is needed in a modal form. I prefer to give the user the ability to decide if he wants to accept or cancel changes to the List. But I receive editlevel mismatch error returning to main window. Would you please send me a template of the code which mannually handles this problem?<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>griffta replied on Tuesday, November 17, 2009</h2>I'm also having problems with this, i'm banging my head against a brick wall.<br /><br />I have a root BO with a child list. I want to edit the child items using a modal form. I'm not using the CSLAExtender Controls, instead i'm using the BindingNode in the child form to handle the unbinding. I've tried so many combinations, but still get a editlevel mismatch when saving the root object.<br /><br />I really could do with any advice!<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
