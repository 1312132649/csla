At first I was getting the "Unable to start debugging" messages but I was able to resolve this by attaching to the worker process thread after running the application without debugging (CTRL + F5). However now I am getting a binary serialisation error message.<br><br>I am guessing that something is wrong with my IIS7.0 setup and I need to delve in further to trace into the TCP messages to see what the actual error is but I just thought I'd see if anyone has got CSLA.NET + ProjectTracker working in a Remoting environment in VISTA.<br><br>Many thanks,<br>Gareth.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, January 08, 2007</h2>Gareth,<br><br>I think you migh be on the bleeding edge for this setup.&nbsp; I don't have any Vista installs, but I would be interested to know what solution you come up with.<br><br>There's arleady an SP1 for Vista? Wow.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, January 08, 2007</h2><P>It isn't a VISTA SP1. It is the SP1 for VS2005 to run on VISTA.</P>
<P>Check out blogs by Scott Guthrie and Rick Strahl for advanced scenarios like this. Rick always runs on the bleeding edge.</P>
