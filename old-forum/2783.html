<P><BLOCKQUOTE><div>This should work.&nbsp; Chances are good the SQL Server principle doesn't have <BR>write permissions on either the files or directory.&nbsp; A common issue is that <BR>when the original attach was done the user didn't have write permissions and <BR>write permission were added later to try to fix the problem.&nbsp; Once the <BR>database has been attached as read_only, an ALTER DATABASE is required to <BR>make it read write.</div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
