<br><br>but really interested in hearing more about hibernate .... with CSLA.... and database independency<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, January 25, 2007</h2>Search the forum, there are other posts on using NHibernate with Csla.<br><br>I'm not sure I care for spring; it seems like it would make coding and maintenance really difficult, because its possible you get a large amount of code injected, and its not obvious where the code comes from.&nbsp; That could make debugging difficult, and I'm not sure I like the idea of actual code being changed simply by changing a configuration file..<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, January 25, 2007</h2>Here's the list of databases supported by nhibernate: <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/361.html">http://www.hibernate.org/361.html</a><br><br>You really have to look at NHibernate itself though; I personally have no experience with it.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ashraf Ali replied on Wednesday, January 24, 2007</h2>I love this post :) :)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Wednesday, January 24, 2007</h2><P>Sure it does, each time I sit down at my desk to do Csla stuff I do it with a nice cup of Java with cream and sugar.</P>
