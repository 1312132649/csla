<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>I have a form that is a wizard to create a new employee record. The wizard has following tabs:</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>Tab 1<BR>Tab 2<BR>Tab 3 â€“ with some checkbox that skips Tab 4 including validation of its fields<BR>Tab 4<BR>Tab 5</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>I have created a NewEmployeeWizard business object that handles this wizard. This object has other Editable objects to store data. This editable object has child objects that store specific data for each tab.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>What I am trying to understand is whether I should have one OR two editable object for both scenarios i.e. 1) when user filling all tabs 2) user filling all tabs except tab 4. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>In terms of use case one can think that there are two use cases here and it is a possibility to create two editable roots, with their own children, for each scenario. The use case object can then decide which editable root to choose. The problem then is where to put data when the wizard first starts and user has not reached tab 3.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>I would really appreciate any help and some views on<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>how to handle such wizard like data entry scenarios where user selection can change the flow of wizard.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>Thanks</FONT></P>
