<P>Do I use CSS even for positioning when using absolute positioning?&nbsp; Bascially each element would have it's own entry in the CSS?&nbsp; How far should one take this separation?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Monday, July 31, 2006</h2><P>Are you going to develop an application that has to be able to change it's look and feel by swapping out one "theme" or "skin" for another?</P>
<P>Or are you just trying to get consistency in appearance in your application?</P>
<P>If the first case, I suspect you want to avoid absolute positioning as fonts might change sizes.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If you have (or might have) visually handicapped users, you might want to avoid it period, as they may need the fonts set really, really big.&nbsp; I worked with great salesman who did his business over the telephone - his fonts were so big that only one letter of the alphabet could show up on the screen at a time.&nbsp; To this day, I'm still impressed that he could read (and understand) under those situations.</P>
<P>I've been trying to avoid absolute positioning where possible simply because my users have different sized monitors, and some want larger fonts than I would design in.&nbsp; I try to put controls and key data at the top left where all monitors will show them.</P>
<P>Basically, I try to avoid setting colors, boldness, etc., in the pages and leave that for stylesheet.</P>
