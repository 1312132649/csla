The technique is discussed in both <EM>Expert C# Business Objects </EM>(chapter 3 I think) and the <EM>CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</EM> (regarding the Saved event).</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>clertem replied on Thursday, September 13, 2007</h2><P>A friend of mine asked me "Why events in the business layer", and I was very bad in replying why.</P>
<P>Can you give me a fool-proof answer please ?</P>
<P>Thanks mate</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 13, 2007</h2><P>No, I can't. I generally recommend against relying on custom events in the business layer - especially to cross logical layer boundaries.</P>
<P>Microsoft has defined a very clear mechanism for communication between the UI and business layers: data binding. My recommendation is to use data binding, and to use the interfaces/events defined by Microsoft for data binding. This gives you the best decoupling, while still leveraging all the pre-built functionality in Web Forms, Windows Forms and WFP.</P>
<P>If you are using events for communication <EM>within the business layer</EM>, then that's OK. And if that makes sense within a given object model, then go for it. But let's face it, most object models don't need events beyond those provided by the data binding events.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jhw replied on Friday, September 14, 2007</h2><P>But if we do want to handle custom events in the ui, can we now do it in vb, or is it still limited to c# as was the problem back in version 1.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 14, 2007</h2>The event declaration technique in C# and VB are the same in .NET 2.0. Again, look at the Saved event for guidance.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Friday, September 14, 2007</h2>Yes, only not in the way we're used to. Check how ExtendedBindingList.vb inside csla.core for an example of how you should do it.<br><br><br>Andr√©s</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
