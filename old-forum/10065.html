<p>First, it is a Silverlight Enterprise application.</p>
<p>My database has over 240 tables and the tables are broken down by schema, for example, Pricing, Operations, Customer, Credit, Invoice, etc.&nbsp; I am utilizing the EF 4.0 and the most recent Csla with the ObjectFactory (by the way, once I got my head around the ObjectFactory, I am liking it).&nbsp; I am trying to decide if I want my Dal to be comprised of one WIndows Class library and have a number of .edmx files in there, for example BelAir.Dal will have Operations.edmx, Administrator.edmx, Security.edmx, etc.&nbsp; Or, should I have a BelAir.Dal.Security, BelAir.Dal.Operations, etc which would break down a specific Dal for each major department.&nbsp; Here is what I am thinking now:</p>
<p>1) By creating a separate Dal for each major department, I will be creating a more flexible application and more scalable, but a lot more projects.&nbsp; As each department will have client and server business objects, example: BelAir.Business.Operations.Client, BelAir.Business.Operations.Server with a namespace of BelAir.Business.Operations.&nbsp; This is what I am battling using Unity or MEF over.</p>
<p>So, if someone can recomend one way or the other for the Dal I would be most appreciative.&nbsp; Also, if someone could recomend Unity or MEF I would appreciate it.&nbsp; I really like Unity as it is easier to follow and debug where as MEF has attributes and may not be as easy to debug, but I would like another perspective on this.&nbsp; I am the sole developer at my company and our parent company has an AS/400 system running RPG so no one has a clue what I am doing so I have no one to ask for guidance and to bounce ideas off of.&nbsp; The good part is I choocse the architecture and &quot;have it my way&quot; the bad part is I bang my head against the wall a lot (that explains the dent in the left side of my head :).</p>
<p>Thanks for everyones help in the past in this forum.&nbsp; Rocky has developed an awesome framework and this forum provides awesome support.</p>

<p>In reality your database IS a shared resource; build your DAL to mirror that reality.&nbsp; You&#39;ll have less maintence for your DAL if you accept that there is a database with 240 tables..</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>simon_may replied on Monday, February 14, 2011</h2><p>Hi there. We are in a simillar position to yourself. Currently extablishing our developement framework and are keen on CSLA 4 in our business layer. Currently debating the DAL (though EF4 is attractive). And looking at PRISM to underpin our UI layer.</p>
<p>When looking at Unity vs MEF, My conclusion is that it is a close run thing. However, Unity appears to be more straightforward to code and as we are primarily targeting Silverlight cannot see how MEF&#39;s module discovery capabiliy (its only significant advantage over Unity) can be leveraged. So we have decided to use Unity.</p>
<p>Have other issues with PRISM but they are outside the scope of this forum and would love to discuss in another channel</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>I&#39;m in the same position only a few months behind where you are, had a look and am leaning towards MEF primarily because it&#39;s included and nothing between the two was a showstopper.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Which did you end up going with?</p>
<p>Also are you happy with Prism overall for your large CSLA project?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>reagan123 replied on Thursday, June 16, 2011</h2><p>Anyone make any progress here? &nbsp;Sorry to bump a second Prism thread. :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
