Each Parent has a Child List. Each Child List has list of childs and each Child in turn has a Grand Child List made of Grand Child. All List are BusinesBaseList and all Parent/Child/Grand Child are BusinessBase. (I loaded the objects using a technique described by Rocky - Thanks)<br><br>Everything works fine like loading, saving, and deleting. I recently added an option to lock each Parent (in the database I update the LockedBy field in the table). Basically my grid displays all Parents and when user click on Edit button in a row I want to lock the parent. When this happens I want re-load the parent and all its children and grand children becoz somebody might have changed it.<br><br>so i am doing this: ParentList[intItemIdx] = ParentList[intItemIdx].Lock(Global.UserName);<br><br>public BusinesBase&lt;Parent&gt; Lock(string UserName)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return Parent.GetParent(new Cirteria(this.ParentId, Context.UserName);<br>}<br><br>The Lock function is almost like a load. It creates a criteria, sets the id to Parent's Id and calls the load method. The lock executes without any problem and returns the Parent.<br><br>The error "Error Invalid for root objects - use Delete instead" is thrown when I assign it. <br><br>I guess i am not understanding CSLA well enough. Did any of you get a similar error? Appreciate any feedback/solution. Please let me know If I haven't given enough info to understand the problem.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Nachi<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RanchCharm replied on Friday, November 09, 2007</h2><font size="2">I found the issue and fixed it.
