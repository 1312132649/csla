<p>The tricky part is that you need the OTHER children to check their rules; usually I do this by having the collection loop through and ask each child to validate its rules and raise appopriate PropertyChanged events.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FrazerS replied on Thursday, March 25, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Andy - </p>
<p>This will work perfectly and actually, opens up another option:&nbsp; setting all the other ones to False instead of failing on validation.</p>
