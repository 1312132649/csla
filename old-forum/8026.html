I have the Dependencies folder where I can see the assembly.&nbsp;The Csla project&nbsp;had referenced to the assembly. Then I downloaded the Blend SDK that did not help either. Then I removed the class &quot;Execute&quot; which was using &quot;System.Windows.Interactivity&quot;. I was able to compile at that time.
