That's initially what I thought would be the case and I've tried it but none of the breakpoints fire. Maybe I need to recheck that they are project references? <br /><br />Gareth</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sergeyb replied on Friday, August 14, 2009</h2>Sounds like a plan.  Make sure you have project dependencies setup as well.<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: Gareth [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Friday, August 14, 2009 11:24 AM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] RE: Debugging n-tier Silverlight Business Server and Data Access Layers<br /><br />Hi Sergey, thanks for your reply.

Everything was set-up correctly.<br />Even Rocky's demo 3-tier projects don't work for me or fire any breakpoints on the server side.<br />However, I've just installed his new 3.8 alpha version and guess what... it's all working.<br />I'm guessing it might be something to do with a pure Silverlight 3.0 installation and not having come via SL 2.0.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Gareth.<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CyclingFoodmanPA replied on Monday, August 17, 2009</h2><P>I had this problem also inititally.&nbsp; What you have to do is to select the Debug option on the menu of VS, then attach to the server process #.&nbsp; For example, if you are debugging the Rolodex example, you would set your breakpoints, run the application, the go back to VS and select debug, attach to process 2430.</P>

I'd just like to clarify that when you attach, don't look for 2430 in the ID column of the list of processes, look for a process with ... "Port 2430" in the Title column.  Probably Process "WebDev.WebServer.Exe", Title="ASP.NET Development Server - Port 2430"</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
