<p>I&#39;m struggling somewhat to understand the implementation of the user/roles in CSLA4, mainly because all of the examples I&#39;ve seen so far use the DTO model to omplement them.</p>
<p>In CSLA 2.x the Roles property was implemented as a List in the PTIdentity class, but I don&#39;t really understand how things fit together in DTO model.</p>
<p>I&#39;m reasonably clear on the &#39;regular&#39; parent/child objects, but because we&#39;re dealing with a system security implement, I&#39;m pretty sure something different applies. Does anyone have an example of how I would implement the PTIdentity, PTPriincipal, xxxDals and IxxxDals?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Graham</p>

<p>I came across a solution, &quot;Permissions&quot; that uses custom authentication that includes a HasPermission implementation. This is very similar to what I&#39;m doing currently with CSLA 2.1.</p>
<p>This might help.</p>
<p>It uses ObjectFactory, but as the authentication model will likely never change once I&#39;ve implemented it, it should suffice. Maybe once I&#39;m more familiar with CSLA4, I can re-write using EncapInvoke....</p>

<p>There are a plethora of examples in the Dataportal sample projects.</p>
<p>Oh, well - at the very least my threads will act as a guide for others following the same path ;)</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
