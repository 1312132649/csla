<p>I have not used prism before, nor regions.&nbsp; I am using Bxf in A SL4 project and using CSLA4 and have created an application based similar to Visual Studio and similar to Outlook.&nbsp; Where I have a in my Outlook bars regions and I have a main window that has tabbed documents.&nbsp; I have got all this up and running. but now I am trying to add content to all my Views/UserControls through their ViewModels.&nbsp; Specifically, I am trying to get actions in one View/UserControl/Region/ViewModel to talk to a different View/ViewModel/Region.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also implemented a simplistic approach to Commanding.&nbsp; Did not use InvokeMethod.</p>
<p>For instance in one of my OutlookBar Views I have a TreeListView (a variation of a TreeView in a datagrid -- to be later expanded on for paging items and quick loading).&nbsp; I would like the selection of a TreeListViewItem to send a message to the tabbed documents.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I can create routed events to do this, but I am not sure if that is correct.&nbsp; I know Rocky&#39;s videos will explain this part, but I am there now.&nbsp; Can someone explain, how to use regions with dynamically.programmatically created tabbed documents and how to get messaging between the various regions?</p>
<p>I also read some people are using BxF with MEF or Prism.&nbsp; Don&#39;t understand why?&nbsp; Is this what I am missing?&nbsp; Anyone?</p>
