<p>What am I missing here?&nbsp; Shouldn&#39;t there be some other items like CSLADataSource?&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to set up a simple binding example to test with and it seems that I would need some of these controls to help work through some winform issues (at least according to the documentation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, I really appreciate but had a quick question.&nbsp; I used Nuget to add the CSLA dll to my project and it doesn&#39;t appear that it added a CSLA.Windows.dll so do you know where I find that?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Visual Studio will automatically load controls into Toolbox that are in your solution. </p>
<p>I prefer this as it lets med upgrade to newer NuGet packages and also have a number of solutions that have different references and switch back and forth between these solutions. </p>
<p>When you install Csla.Windows into toolbox you have registered that assembly and version in Visual Studio - not just for this solution.</p>
