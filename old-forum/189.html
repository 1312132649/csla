<P>We concluded that providing you could write a SharePoint WebPart (that's the widget that SharePoint understands) that surfaced a CSLA BO, there should be no reason why you couldn't build a SharePoint site around a bunch of CSLA-based WebParts.</P>
<P>We didn't get as far as doing a technical proof of concept though.</P>
<P>Have you taken this any further?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>thedeveloper replied on Wednesday, May 31, 2006</h2><P>Hi David,</P>
<P>Thanks for the reply.<BR>No I haven taken this further yet. But I will&nbsp;look into this in Juli.</P>
