<P>Has anyone considered using or implemented&nbsp;an external component to manage validation rules and perform validation rather than holding instances of the ValidationRules class for each type of business object?</P>
<P>I am working on an application where the memory footprint has grown significant due to the manner in which users make use of the app so we are doing quite a bit of profiling on how the app utilizes memory.&nbsp; The addition of per-type validation rules is certainly a significant step forward, however there is still some overhead to having an instance of the ValidationRules class for each business object type.&nbsp; It has occurred to me that we could possibly pull this out of our business objects and have them collaborate with another component, ValidationManager, for instance (essentially a dictionary of ValidationRules objects keyed by type).&nbsp; Instead of holding an instance of the class in a private variable, our AddBusinessRules method would be refactored to call ValidationManager.AddRule instead.&nbsp; The ValidationManager class would manage the list of rules for each type and instance.&nbsp; To perform validation, our business objects would delegate to the ValidationManager.Validate(this) method - notice the argument which is used by the ValidationManager to perform both per-type and per-instance checks if they exist.</P>
<P>I'm looking for arguments for and against this approach so we can make a more educated decision if it would be beneficial to refactor our code in this way.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P>

<P>I know I never use it, I only use per-type rules. Nor do I directly know anyone who is using per-instance rules.</P>
<P>So it does make me wonder if I shouldn't just drop per-instance support at some point (like in 3.5).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Saturday, December 01, 2007</h2><P>I am only using per type rules.</P>

<P>I also use the strongly typed rule methods in a given class if the rule is specific to it and I need access to member variables. But it is still a per type rule.</P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Yeah, exactly. I use a lot of rules implemented in specific
business classes, but I haven&#8217;t used a per-instance rule since I changed
everything in 2.1.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
