Looking at it with a technical vision i see it as having an 2nd dataportal for each business object. Even for SaaS in a normal situation i would still use 1 dataportal as using 1 machine with IIS but the 2nd IIS is just an extension on the current architecture as extra layer for going outside.<BR><BR>Machine 1 - End user - Customer who bought&nbsp;the&nbsp;SaaS (Frontend and business objects)<BR>Machine 2 - IIS hosting&nbsp;- For selling the&nbsp;SaaS (Business objects)<BR>Machine 3 - IIS hosting - Standard CSLA host (Business objects)<BR>Machine 4 - DB server - Database (Data layer)</P>
<P>Between Machine 2 and Machine 3 there is a client machine as well in normal configurations, but in this situation i think we'll have the need for a second hosting machine with some extra business.<BR><BR>Is it possible to configure CSLA to use a&nbsp;routed c.q. gated dataportal?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Friday, October 02, 2009</h2><P>Things have changed (already) because i misunderstood the concept of SaaS, i thought it was selling software as a service meaning the way u say it. But&nbsp;the&nbsp;business people at my company&nbsp;ment "selling&nbsp;a website" which we host and a customer pays for on a regular basis. Very basic and not so much SaaS as i though it was with selling webservices with an optional frontend.<BR><BR>There is no need for an 2nd dataportal (i think) but still i wonder if it would had been possible ;)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, October 02, 2009</h2><P>I guess I'm not entirely sure what you are asking - but if I understand correctly, then this is one of the standard architecture models supported by CSLA .NET for Silverlight.</P>
<P>There is no pre-built "routing" data portal for CSLA .NET for Windows - though you could certainly create one if necessary and it wouldn't be that terribly hard.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
