Is this true for service-side code running on the other side of the WCF service (on the server)? Do I have access to the principal of the logged in user in Server.DataPortal?</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, October 21, 2008</h2><P>Yes.</P>
<P>The user is transferred along with the BO.</P>

This change was for WPF only, so Windows Forms and Web Forms (and services and workflows) are unaffected by the change.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tkhan replied on Wednesday, October 22, 2008</h2><P>Thanks for clearing that up!</P>
