<P>A lot of the discussions have focused on VB.NET solutions and translating those examples to C# is overly challenging.</P>
<P>Right now I'm finding the 12/25 <EM>Inheritance And Generics </EM>thread and the 5/26 CSLA Inheritance problem thread to be fairly straighforward introductions to the matter</P>
<P>Am I on the right track ???</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>I'd say those threads are probably decent ones to get started on. </P>
<P>One very useful mechanism, which I don't know is or is not mentioned in those two threads you mentioned, is the employing of interfaces (Rocky does this within the framework as well). </P>
<P>So if my "Profiles" are either Individuals or Organizations, and I have Individuals : Profile&lt;Individual&gt; and Organizations : Profile&lt;Organization&gt; - how can I refer to a generic "Profile"? With generics, this is not directly possible! </P>
<P>So the idea is - throw an IProfile interface onto Profile&lt;T&gt;, expose public members via IProfile, and pass around an IProfile, which both Individuals and Organizations will implement by nature of descending from Profile&lt;T&gt;. So IProfile might have members such as Id, Name, Sort Name, Status, etc. </P>
<P>For factory methods, obviously one cannot call a static method on a generic template (on a generic class, sure, but not something like: Profile&lt;T&gt;.GetProfile(1928);.) So what I've done in this circumstance is to create factory classes - ProfileFactory, for example - which implements the ProfileFactory.GetProfile(int id), ProfileFactory.Exists(int id), etc. </P>
<P>Inheritance going through BusinessBase&lt;T&gt; is a little tricky (an option is to go around BusinessBase&lt;T&gt; and inherit from Core.BusinessBase), but I decided to attempt to remain true to the more advocated route - all editable business objects descend from BusinessBase&lt;T&gt;. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
