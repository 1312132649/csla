Don't sweat it - just ignore ApplyEdit and BeginEdit and call Save when you've updated your object.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 07, 2008</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>mr_lasseter:</strong></div><div>

<P>Yes, that should be correct. Just don't try to use in-place editing in a grid. It will work to a point, but some grid concepts require IEditableObject and so obviously can't work.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
