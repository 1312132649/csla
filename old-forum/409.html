There are apparently some dependancy issues that can cause the mail gateway to fail when the system boots. Magenic reboots their servers every night and so every now and then we get bit by this failure due to random timing on how the services start up.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
