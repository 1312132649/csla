I need to run all rules, even the user made no changes. Sometimes we have the case, that our data
gets updated by script and we need to re-run all rules when the user edits data.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, October 07, 2011</h2><p>No, there is no built-in function for that.</p>
<p>The primary function is that all rules should be rerun when a value is edited. </p>
<p>You will need to create a function that walks the edit-object tree and call CheckRules on all editable objects. <br />Have a look at the <span style="color:#2baaaf;">ICheckRules </span>interface for calling CjeckRules.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Holger replied on Friday, October 07, 2011</h2><p>Can you add this to the featurelist for the next release? </p>
<p>I think everything is there&nbsp;to implement this in an easy way (FieldManager.GetAllChilds + BusinessRules.CheckRules).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
