I can access the methods I created in the derived class but I cannot access any of the methods or properties of the base class &quot;BusinessListBase&quot;. &nbsp;For example if I want to know the count of items in the collection I would reference the &quot;Count&quot; property using my instantiated derived class, but &quot;Count&quot; does not show up on intellisense and I get an error when I use that property name. &nbsp;In the VB version of these classes I do not have this problem. &nbsp;What am I missing? &nbsp;Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
