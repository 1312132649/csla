<p>I&#39;m pretty new to CSLA and I already have a Question.</p>
<p><br />My Situation:<br />Currently I&#39;m writing my Diploma Thesis and my task is to copy a Desktop Application (in WPF) to the web using Asp.Net MVC. In the last weeks I analysed the desktop application and build a corresponding Gui Prototype. Now I want to fill my GUI and my first step is to fill a jsTree with data from CSLA Business Objects, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem but the Tree has to load lazy like it does in the desktop application.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a problem to load the data, just how do I make it load lazy without converting it into html, json, or xml?<span style="font-family:Courier,Monospaced;" class="fixed_width"></span></p>
<p>Is there anyone with experience using jsTree with CSLA lazy loading?<br />Just write if you need any further informations <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I assume your WPF application uses the DataPortal to access data and this is not applicable for your web client using javascript. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DerThomas replied on Thursday, November 17, 2011</h2><p>I thought so... but is it possible to send the data back without the need to rebuild the data source from the service:</p>
<p>Here a short scenario i thought about using a WCF service which builds a json obj from CSLA:</p>
<p>1. jsTree get&#39;s json obj and builds a tree<br />2. user deletes an article inside of the tree<br />3. tree informs a second service to update the CSLA Object<br />4. json obj is rebuild because of the &quot;new&quot; CSLA Object<br />5. then it starts at #1 again</p>
<p>I hope I build a correct scenario... excuse my confusion but this is my first time with mvc and CSLA <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-15.gif" alt="Geeked" /></p>
<p>Or is there any other way of rebuilding the tree.<br />Currently I&#39;m studying the jstree documentation to hopefully find a solution.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
