We deploy seperate layers to seperate servers(web server and app server). If BLL uses some key/value setting in web.config, which web.config should we put the key/value setting? Since there are 2 web.config files, one is on web server and another is on application server.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, July 26, 2013</h2><p>You need to put those key/values where they are used. Could be both or just one of them - &nbsp;depending on how your code read these values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I this is used by business logic only and BLL runs on the application server then that&acute;s the proper place.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fredg replied on Friday, July 26, 2013</h2><p>Thanks. Actually we put BLL on both web server and application server, so on which web.config should we put the settings if they are used by BLL? Both?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, July 26, 2013</h2><p>Yes, probably both web.config files.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, July 26, 2013</h2><p>Alternatively you can store them all on the app server and just have a read-only business object to expose the values, fetching this object up-front as part of your startup process - then you&#39;d only have the settings in one location if that&#39;s really important to you.</p>
<p>Otherwise yup wherever you need the settings, supply em.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
