When I try to set up the data portal on sharepoint, I get the same error as when I forgot to sign my dll. (Something about an invalid cast from the Data Portal). {using csla.net 3.7}<br /><br />I don't expect to see a whole tutorial on how to configure the data portal in MOSS (Which we're running), but I would appreciate any links to any resources that exist already. If anyone has been down this road before, Feel free to cue me in.<br /><br />That being said, if there isn't a set of documentation out there, can we start that discussion here? 600,000+ SharePoint Developers is a pretty good market for the Csla.NET framework...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GlennP replied on Friday, October 30, 2009</h2>Hmm... Ok let me see if a little clarification on what I'm trying to do will ge the discussion started... We're writing web user controls to be hosted in our SharePoint environment. It's been set up to load the .NET framework 3.51 so that we can use AJAX and Charting controls in our internal portal. I've even added the Csla 3.7 assemblies to the web.config.<br /><br />In fact, I have the Csla objects working in MOSS as long as I don't send anything to a remote dataportal (which is currently being hosted using the remoting example on a different server). The only time it doesn't work is when I un-comment the lines in the web.config that send the objects to the remote data portal...<br /><br />Any Ideas?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, October 30, 2009</h2>I don't think I've seen problems with assembly signing causing invalid cast exceptions.&nbsp; Have you gotten the same configurtion to work outside of sharepoint?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, October 30, 2009</h2><P>It would help to have the real stack trace too - often the real problem isn't the first line of the exception, but is deeper in the trace.</P>
