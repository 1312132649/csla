we are currently implementing new CSLA 3.6.x templates. If any of you
have any template suggestions or improvements that you would like to see please
let me know.<br><br>Thanks<br>-Blake Niemyjski

Having the option to pull the metadata from the DBML file would pave the way for when we have better understanding of Entity Framework.

I've also included the Validation rules and authorization rules in this partial class and made it them partial.

Down the road when we get to beta / release mode if you would like to review these templates and give us your feedback that would be awesome :).<br><br>Thanks<br>-Blake Niemyjski</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mamboer replied on Thursday, February 05, 2009</h2>Hi,<br>I'm concerned on the DA tech u choose.<br>LinqToSql,or EF? <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mamboer replied on Thursday, February 05, 2009</h2>Have u throught about the affections on code gen when we use Repository pattern in DataAccess layer?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bniemyjski replied on Tuesday, February 17, 2009</h2>Hello,<br><br>Sorry about taking a bit to get back to you, I haven't been getting the emails when ever someone responds to my posts.<br><br>"I'm concerned on the DA tech u choose.
