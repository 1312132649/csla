<P>If I want to run application in one PC, do I have to install IIS and setup WcfHost?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 07, 2007</h2><P>Why wouldn't you just run the data portal in local mode and avoid the whole "server" concept and overhead?</P>
<P>But if you really want to use the WCF technology, you can use one of the light-weight WCF bindings like named pipes. Even so, you do need to host the "server" in some process on your client. In Vista you can use WAS, but if you need to support XP or whatever, then you'll need to either use IIS or write your own Windows service.</P>
<P>However, one thought that occurs to me is that you could, maybe, get tricky, and make your existing app into a WCF host. In other words, your WCF call could loop through WCF and back to your own process. That should probably be possible. You'd have to write some code in your app to "host WCF" - basically write a custom WCF data portal host that could run in your own client. Yeah, that should be doable.</P>
<P>But it makes no sense. Why would you incur all that overhead when you could just switch the data portal to run in local mode and get the same result, but with far better performance?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CSLAer replied on Saturday, November 10, 2007</h2><P>Sorry if this question is too simple. How can I switch the data portal to run in local mode? </P>
<P>I just want to run the application locally and don't want to setup IIS and WCFhost&nbsp;(Not every PC has IIS installed). </P>
