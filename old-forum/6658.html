<P>I have a BusinessListBase with children, in C# with the Csla 3.6 it appears it not possible to have properties in the parent. Basicly in previous versions I would had a BusinessListBase with&nbsp;a few properties and then there were children. Is this&nbsp;a design feature or am I doing the wrong thing.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance</P>

But you should be able to use regualr fields and properties. You then need to handle the serialize and deserialize events to move the data across the wire.<br /><br />Joe<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
