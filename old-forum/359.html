<P>I'm still trying to understand how to properly design my business objects to satisfy my use cases.</P>
<P>I need to have a pick list where users can choose one of many items. There's several properties they need to see, so I'm thinking of showing a grid in a pop up type window.</P>
<P>I'm thinking I should have a class that derives from ReadOnlyListBase which is a collection of objects derived from ReadOnlyBase.</P>
<P>Is this the right way to do this type of thing?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
<P>Mike</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, June 13, 2006</h2>That is what I do.&nbsp; Just display the choices in a DataGridView, which only allows one row to be selected.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Tuesday, June 13, 2006</h2><P>Thanks for the Reply Andy, I just needed some confirmation.
