<P class=MsoNormal>There's a reason I didn't do that to begin with, and it goes with the reason why I broke out the extender itself from the binding components that drive it. &nbsp;Microsoft provided an interface, IButtonControl, for all to obey when writing custom buttons and links. &nbsp;So far, I've encountered that all the major component vendors use this for their buttons and links. &nbsp;This is the reason the extender works great with third-party controls. &nbsp;Microsoft provided no such interface for the creation of toolbar items. &nbsp;Everyone's toolbar is completely different and has no point of commonality or abstraction. &nbsp;So I provided the BindingHelper component so that you can have the same functionality that the extender provides for you regarding binding, unbinding, undoing, etc. &nbsp;It takes code, but not nearly as much as doing it all manually. &nbsp;I have a sample project which I forwarded you, but am attaching here, that demonstrates both cases with two identical forms. &nbsp;One form uses buttons, the other uses a toolbar.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, June 22, 2009</h2>Oh, the ActionExtenderSample he mentions in that reply is in the Samples download for CSLA .NET.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
