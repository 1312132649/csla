<P>In other words, somewhere in the app there's an event handler hooked up to that CollectionChanged event, and in that event handler there's a bug where the code gets a NullReferenceException.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, October 22, 2009</h2><P>Oh, and are you using Silverlight 2 or 3?</P>
<P>There was a change from SL 2 to 3 that broke collections, and the fix is in CSLA .NET 3.7 - so perhaps that's the issue?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Fele replied on Thursday, October 22, 2009</h2>Thanks for fast response.<br><br>I've upgraded my project with 3.7.1 dll's.

<p class=MsoNormal><span>it sounds like you may not have rebuilt and redeployed both
client and server assemblies? So you don&#8217;t have the same versions of everything
on the server after you try 3.7.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
