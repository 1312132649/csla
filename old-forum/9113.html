<p>We are&nbsp;migrating to .net 2005 or 2010 depending on the effort required.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<p>1. Has anyone had any experience with this and can offer some advice? (not only CSLA but .net itself)</p>
<p>2. If we migrate to 2010, we need CSLA 4.0&nbsp;&nbsp; When might this be out of beta?&nbsp; Would you wait until it is?</p>
<p>3. What CSLA books are recommended?&nbsp; As there&nbsp;are currently no 2010 (CSLA 4.0) books, should we purchase the 3.x books or wait for the 4.x books?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Steve</p>
