<P>In 3.5.x I was using it as a container, but in 3.6 I'm using it as a resource, and that's a lot cleaner, so I recommend using the 3.6 approach.</P>
<P>In Silverlight we put the ObjectStatus properties directly into CslaDataProvider, and we may do that in .NET now too, as it is an even easier solution in some cases.</P>
<P>But look at the 3.6 ProjectTracker (C#) and examine how ObjectStatus is used - that'll work in 3.5 as well.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, September 29, 2008</h2>It just started working for me for some reason... but I'll check out 3.6 code and update to that.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
