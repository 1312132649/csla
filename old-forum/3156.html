This company uses a layered architecture with the following structure:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UI<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Web Services<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facade<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business Rules<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Access Layer<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UI invokes a method on a web service that normally produces a call on the data access layer to obtain a dataset with the data (or to update data from a dataset). This folks don't use oop at all, and I miss it very much. I want to propose the CSLA framework to use a more object oriented aproach to design solutions, but I don't know how to maintain the web service layer without hit the performance of the application. With the datasets this people reduce at minimum the access to the database, however, with the csla each entity needs to access the database to obtain its data (thus calling many times the web service layer). <br><br>Please I need a little bit of help.<br><br>Thanks and sorry for my english.<br><br>-----------<br>Jose<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, July 09, 2007</h2>Well the web service will always be slow from a performance angle.&nbsp; If you want to use Csla, your best bet would be to throw out the web service completely, and the facade.&nbsp; The goal of OO would be to build a more maintable application, but if they don't see any problems maintaning the current application, you may be hard pressed to convience them to change.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
