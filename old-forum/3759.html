<P>I've use CSLA successfully for Windows apps, working on my first attempt at a Web app. Apologies if this is a dummy question. Using 2.1.4.</P>
<P>I have a class that derives from BusinessListBase and showing in a (Infragistics) grid, using the CslaDataSource. I modify some data in the grid, and of course I want to save those changes.</P>
<P>My problem is that I can't seem to get to the changed data. I put a button on the form that when clicked, simply does myGrid.DataBind() and I see the old values. I thought data binding was 2 way now? Maybe I'm just missing something?</P>
<P>Any help appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
<P>Mike</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
