<P>The trick with the ChildChanged event is that it cascades up the chain, but also that it <EM>originates in response to PropertyChanged or ListChanged</EM>. Without care, you could end up with too many events being raised. </P>
<P>If all you want is to be notified that a child changed, the OnChildChanged() is the thing to override.</P>
<P>If you want to muck around with the plumbing and change the way the event cascades, then OnChildChangedInternal() is the thing to override.</P>
<P>I don't think "Core" and "Internal" are comparable here. In this case "Internal" means that these methods are part of the internal plumbing infrastructure that cascades the event up the parent-child chain.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, October 03, 2008</h2>Well, in my case I'm trying to run a rule over a collection to ensure that a part number exists once in the list.&nbsp; So in my root (which contains the BLB) I override OnChildChanged, and if the source is the collection, I call a CheckRules on the collection, which asks each object to check itself.<br><br>Also, it does seem like I want OnChildChanged, not the internal version.&nbsp; Thanks for clearing that up.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tchimev replied on Friday, January 23, 2009</h2>I have the same situation.<br>A root object with child BLB.<br>I try to recheck the rules of each object in the collection after child BLB changed.<br><br>How do you call CheckRules on the child collection to ask each object to check itself?<br>Did you implement it yourself?<br><br>Thank you.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, January 23, 2009</h2>The BLB has a method, internal void CheckRules(), that iterates each item in the collection.&nbsp; It in turn calls an internal void CheckRules method which exists on the BB child type; that method simply calls ValidationRules.CheckRules();<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tchimev replied on Saturday, January 24, 2009</h2>Thank you very much, I'll try it.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
