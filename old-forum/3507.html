Because the grid is bound to the list, the properties are automatically updated. When I am done editing all the children, then I call List.save to update all the children in the db.</P>

<LI>Using BusinessListBase as an editable root list, the user can edit the (editable child) items in the grid and then click a Save button to save all changes at once.</LI>
<LI>Using EditableRootListBase as a dynamic list, the user can edit the (editable root) items in the grid, and as they leave each row the row's edits are automatically committed.</LI></OL></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
