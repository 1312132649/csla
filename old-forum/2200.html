<P>It has been nearly a year since this new forum has come online, and the information contained in the old forum becomes less useful as time goes by. Additionally, there's a continual stream of new user requests for that forum - most of which are spammers, but some of which are authentic - people who've stumbled on the wrong forum by accident and end up being redirected here eventually.</P>
<P>Does anyone see any issue with eliminating that old forum?</P>
<P>I don't know if Terrence monitors this forum, but if so, what would this do to <A href="http://www.searchcsla.com">www.searchcsla.com</A>? Perhaps it can go away as well, or perhaps it can remain as a searchable archive of the old forum?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>malloc1024 replied on Thursday, January 25, 2007</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">I would be disappointed to see the old forum go.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even though some of the information is
obsolete, there is still a lot of good information on design and other things
that are not dependent on a CSLA version.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>It would be a shame to lose this valuable information.&nbsp; <span></span></span><span></span>Whenever I have a question that is not
dependent on a CSLA version, I always use searchcsla.com first.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that more people participated
in the old forum.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because of this, I usually
find better answers in the old forum.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I don’t think searchcsla.com would be affected if you
removed the old forum.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think it stores
its information somewhere else.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whenever
I made a change to one of my posts 30 minutes after I posted it, the change
would not take effect on the seachcsla.com site.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I don’t mind if the old forum goes as long as seachcsla.com
site stays up.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, I would not like
to see both go down.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is still a
lot of good information on the old forum and it would be a shame to lose it
all.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
