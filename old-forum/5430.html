<P>So my question is, can someone give an explanation on when each combination should be used for a ReadOnly List of Editable objects, ReadOnlyList of ReadOnly objects, EditableList of Editable objects (I know that you cannot have an Editable List of ReadOnly objects)?&nbsp; My understanding is the following:</P>
<P>ROList of Editable for ?</P>
<P>ROList of RO for information purposes like displaying a list of assigned resources to a project.</P>
<P>EditableList of Editable for making changes to a list and the children in a list.</P>
