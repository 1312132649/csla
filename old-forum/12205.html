(This is a winforms app by the way).</p>
<p>That seems to work well, and because the delegate list is static it seems to avoid issues with memory leaks and accidentally keeping business objects alive.</p>
<p>To trigger the delegates I have overridden&nbsp;BusinessBase.Save, but to do that I had to change the declaration from &#39;public T Save()&#39; to &#39;public virtual T Save()&#39; in the framework code.</p>
<p>In the happy new world of NuGet I&#39;d like to avoid having changes to the CSLA framework, so is there something else I can override or handle that would give me the same functionality? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a feeling Save may not be virtual for a good reason?</p>

<p>I assume that you are using CSLA 4.5 and the method to override is actually SaveAsync.</p>
<p>This method is called for both sync and async Save.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Monday, November 11, 2013</h2><p>Perfect, thanks Jonny</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
