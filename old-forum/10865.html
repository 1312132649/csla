<p>I&#39;d suspect many would be in the same camp.</p>
<p>What is the implications for those of us trying to keep up with the latest versions of CSLA / would we still be able to build the latest CSLAs&nbsp;against SL 4?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, November 10, 2011</h2><p>I don&#39;t know the truth of this rumor one way or another.</p>
<p>SL5 adds some new features/capabilities over SL4. Many of them bring more .NET parity, meaning I can remove #if statements to bring some SL code more in line with .NET code - unifying the code base. These changes to the Csla project shouldn&#39;t be all that substantial.</p>
<p>SL5 also adds some features/capabilities in the XAML side of things - UI focused. This impacts the Csla.Xaml project for SL, and in most cases also brings things more in line with .NET/WPF (like having a data context changed event). Some of these changes might result in more substantial changes to controls like PropertyStatus.</p>
<p>Once we change the 4.3 code to build using the SL5 features, that code won&#39;t build for SL4 any longer - kind of by definition.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>AaronH replied on Saturday, December 24, 2011</h2><p>Any idea what the eta is on the next release of CSLA for SL5?&nbsp; Do you know if simply compiling v 4.2.2 against SL5 will run properly?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, December 24, 2011</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>AaronH<br></b>
<p>Any idea what the eta is on the next release of CSLA for SL5?&nbsp; Do you know if simply compiling v 4.2.2 against SL5 will run properly?</p>

<p>My limited use of 4.2 with SL5 has revealed no issues. There could be some I haven&#39;t encountered, but all the basic functionality is fine.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t expect 4.3 to be a radical departure - the changes I anticipate are mostly removal of #if SILVERLIGHT statements where SL5 has caught up with .NET 4 in certain feature areas. And <em>maybe</em> some Csla.Xaml changes to use things like DataContextChanged if I have time.</p>
<p>In reality, the biggest change is probably Sergey&#39;s changes to serialization, with major improvements in terms of byte size reduction. Major enough to mean compression probably won&#39;t be necessary for any but the most extreme scenarios.</p>
<p>I expect 4.3 will be feature complete by mid-Feb, and released by mid-March.</p>
<p>Because 4.2 appears to work fine in SL5, I don&#39;t feel tremendous time pressure, so I want to allow time for other wish list items to get done as people&#39;s schedule permits.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Saturday, December 24, 2011</h2><p>This is the minimum system specs for SL5:</p>
