<p>I have a root object in a multi-tiered Silverlight app with a long chain of children that is loaded when the user logs in. They have to wait a few seconds for all the objects to load, but then they can interact as though using a standard desktop application. This works well. BUT when they save (minor) changes to the root object, the whole tree is sent back to the server - taking a long time. Is it possible to mark children as [NotSendable] or something (like [NotUndoable])? I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m not the first to run into this.</p>
<p>Thanks, James.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Wednesday, July 07, 2010</h2><p>No, you&#39;re not the first.&nbsp; <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" />&nbsp; If you do a search on the forum for something like &quot;datagram&quot;, you&#39;ll see all sorts of discussions on this.</p>
<p>The short answer is that, out-of-the-box, CSLA does not support what you&#39;re wanting to do.&nbsp; But it is possible, I believe through some custom programming for the DataPortal.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure how much work it would entail in a SL context - all the other discussions on this have been in a more traditional client-server context, and modifying the DataPortal to do what you want in those instances is (I think) a little easier.</p>
<p>You might also look into utilizing compression - the general consensus&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;that compression can do wonders for things like this, and it&#39;s going to be a whole lot easier to implement.&nbsp; Again, a forum search ought to give you the details.</p>
<p>HTH</p>

It demonstrates how to implement a diffgram/datagram model for a large object graph, and should work the same in SL as in .NET since it is all at the business object level.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>James Thomas replied on Tuesday, July 20, 2010</h2><p>DiffGram: really useful - thanks!</p>
