<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>As long as you are talking WPF/SL and fixed set of images, my
vote be:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Keep images in resource file<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have a flag in BO (such as enum /int to indicate what state a BO
is in)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Use IValueConverter to translate BO flag into an image from
resource file.&nbsp; You can also cache icons in value converter to optimize access.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>This way you are keeping UI from BO and can still use standard
XAML binding to show images by binding to a flag from BO with a converter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I start to tie in my UI to
my first set of CSLA BO classes I'm wondering how best to handle the set of
icons I want to show for different data states.&nbsp; I have a number of flags
that indicate to the user the state of their data (Invalid, Missing, Corrected,
Edited, HasAuditTrail, etc).<br>
<br>
From a GUI perspective the users can click on the icon and 'do stuff' based on
the current state.<br>
<br>
Anyhow its previous life the application GUI had all the icons placed on top of
each other and some logic in the visible property to hide/show them.<br>
<br>
I'd like to be a little cleaner this time but I was wondering which way other
people were doing this type of thing.&nbsp; Currently I have an enum of states
for each icon set that basically each state would match an icon filename.<br>
<br>
In the GUI I'm displaying a collection of these objects so each row can have
the same set of icons.&nbsp; My GUI's are Silverlight/ASP and WPF (at
somepoint)<br>
<br>
I thought of a couple of options:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1) In the GUI preload all the resource icons and then on
state change I change the image object to show the new icon<br>
<br>
1a) Do this dynamically so I only load icons I need (LazyLoad)<br>
<br>
2) Keep everything in the BO and have a bindable byte[] stream property? Then I
would maybe LazyLoad the icons as I need them from the assembly into a
dictionary type collection so I can just return the ones I need?&nbsp; I would
keep the dictionary/collection of icons in the BOList parent.&nbsp; I saw
Sergey's blog post about databinding to a byte[] property to show images in
Silverlight<br>
<br>
2a)&nbsp; Same idea but load all my icons up front<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Any direction would be appreciated<br>
<br>
thanks<br>
