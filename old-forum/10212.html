Example, I need to return a collection of Invoices, including information about each Invoice Customer, and I need to bind this collection to a grid (ex DataGridView), which will display information from both Invoice and Customer entities (ex DataPropertyName = &quot;Customer.Name&quot;).</p>
<p>And while grid is bound to this collection, I need to be able to sort on each column. Is this possible?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>CSLA collections are just .NET collections with the .NET binding interfaces implemented. The same with CSLA objects.</p>
<p>XAML binding can drill down to a child object. I don&#39;t think Windows Forms or Web Forms could do that.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Goran replied on Tuesday, March 29, 2011</h2><p>Well, since we cant change how windows forms data binding works, then only other way is to extended our collections with custom PropertyDescriptors and custom TypeDescriptors. I was able to extend sortable collection to support binding to child properties, but I am busting my head how to create DynamicMethod delegate to support comparing on nested properties. <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-9.gif" alt="Crying" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, March 30, 2011</h2><p>The simple solution is to flatten the hierarchy and have just one list with properties (no hierarchy). You shouldn&#39;t care too much about entities in your list and rather view it a one list with properties.</p>
<p>That way - Windows forms databinding will work just fine and you can sort on any field - just wrap your list with SortedBindingList in your form. </p>
