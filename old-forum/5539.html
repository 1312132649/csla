<P>Then I make sure that the databinding of the combo box is bound to the correct property on my BO and that the error provider is bound to the bindingsource of the BO. This usually makes it work for me. </P>
<P>Also, make sure you are calling ValidationRules.CheckRules() during the create/update/etc methods when needed.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>k2so replied on Monday, October 06, 2008</h2>I see now.<br><br>I've been using the on select change event to capture the value of the property instead of setting a binding.<br><br>Thanks.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
