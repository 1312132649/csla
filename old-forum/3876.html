<P>I'm not really sure how a model like this should be implimented.&nbsp; It's not enought for a user's roles to be loaded, since it could have more or less permissions to specific instances of a location object.</P>
<P>This seems like a common a design requirement.&nbsp; Am I making the problem harder than it actuall is?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>stefan replied on Saturday, November 10, 2007</h2>You might want to read this thread, specially Rocky's comment (2nd post):<br><br><a HREF="/forums/thread/18658.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/18658.aspx</a><br><br>Stefan<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
