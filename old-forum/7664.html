I had to set focus to it via Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(()=>{curtain.Focus();}) and (sometimes) I had to set TabNavigation to KeyboardNavigationMode.Cycle to keep tab key from going back to the main screen.<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: Gareth [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Tuesday, September 22, 2009 8:06 AM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: [CSLA .NET] Overlay.Visibility / Canvas usage in the SL Demos<br /><br />I've been using the Canvas and Overlay.Visibility technique employee in the Demos to stop any interaction with the user interface whilst an async operation is happening. <br /><br />I've noticed that whilst this does stop any mouse click interaction it does not stop keyboard interaction and you can merrily enter characters and tab to other fields when the canvas is overlaid.<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed this or have I got a problem with my implementation?<br /><br />Gareth.<br /><br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
