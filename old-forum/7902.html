<P>This caught me out with my deployment msi as it did not replace the older file with the new one.</P>
<P>Any reason why the versioning is hard-coded&nbsp;or would it be better to have VS auto-increment the last two parts of the number?&nbsp; i.e. 3.8.3589.17596.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, October 29, 2009</h2><P>I specifically use the&nbsp;x.y.z parts of the number. The fourth part could be auto-incremented.</P>
<P>But remember that I provide you with source, not binaries. So the auto-number would be <EM>unique to you</EM>. That's probably fine for the fourth part, but not for the x.y.z because they have very clear universal meaning to identify the specific release version of the framework.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Thursday, October 29, 2009</h2>OK thanks - loving the framework by the way.&nbsp; I skipped from 1.53 up to 3.7 and now 3.8 and am enjoying using it with a WPF UI.&nbsp; <br>Productivity is so high and potential to expand and support different physcial deployments and UI's is superb! Not sure my client fully appreciates what they are getting, but that's a marketing job I need to do.<br><br>Thanks again.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
