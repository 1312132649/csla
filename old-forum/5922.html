<P>I'm getting an EditLevel mismatch because the child object has BindingEdit=true even though I have unbound the data source. </P>
<P>I'll continue to diagnose, but more interesting is that the designer wants to create 2 binding sources when you drag a child collection from a root data source on to a form. So, you have one binding source for the root, and a separate binding source for the child list. However, the datasource for the child list binding source references the root binding source and specifies the property name for the list. Does CSLA support this model? I'm just asking because of previous posts&nbsp;suggesting that an object could only be participating in one binding source at a time.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, December 02, 2008</h2><P>It is fine to have a parent-child (master-detail) relationship between bindingsoure objects.</P>
<P>Each CSLA object is only bound to one bindingsource, not both.</P>
<P>The trick is that you must unbind the child bindingsource, then unbind the parent bindingsource. The ParentChildGrandchildTest sample app in the samples download (3.6) illustrates this.</P>
<P>Also, the new CslaActionExtender control&nbsp;in 3.6 automates the process pretty much completely.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Tuesday, December 02, 2008</h2>Thanks, I missed the child binding source unbind -- I should have double checked in ProjectTracker first. &nbsp;How naive of me to think that setting the parent binding source to null&nbsp;would also detach any directly linked binding sources... ;)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
