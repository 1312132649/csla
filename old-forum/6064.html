I don't know what cslacs.sln is for, so I'm not much help. If webmvc has anything to do with asp.net mvc, I do know that you have to install asp.net mvc before you can load an mvc project into visual studio.</P>

I think the build solution has something to do with getting the templates installed in VS but I'm not sure. the csla project builds ok as you point out.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
