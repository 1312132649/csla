I have the <b><i>Csla.resources.dll</i></b> file in <b><i>bin\fr</i></b> directory...<br><br>What am I missing ?<br><br>Thank you.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Sunday, February 11, 2007</h2>The reason is that your data binding is throwing a conversion exception.&nbsp; This is caught and displayed.&nbsp; Because it is an exception, you are not allowed to leave until you fix it.&nbsp; Regular business rules allow you to&nbsp; move on because they do not throw exceptions.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Aliator replied on Sunday, February 11, 2007</h2>Ok, so I'll use an extended TextBox to allow numbers.<br><br>Thank you<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
