<P>I had a similar problem when I started adding BO collections to datagrids on a wizard control.</P>
<P>I'm building in conditional logic into the wizard (i.e., some wizard steps will not be executed if they are not-applicable) but the not-applicable databinding was still taking place upon the initial page load.</P>
<P>Setting the controls to not-visible seemed to make a difference also.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
