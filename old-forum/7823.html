What they really want is the filter to apply to each name as an 'or' so that "John" would show both John Smith and Bill Johnson.<br><br>I don't want the data provider to round-trip the database for each character the user types, so I'm thinking the LinqBindingList is the way to go.&nbsp; Pull the data once and then filter it using Linq using what the user types.&nbsp; Does anyone have an example or some guidance on how to do this?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, October 20, 2009</h2><P>As I recall you do not get a LinqBindingList when using a Read Only Collection.</P>
<P>Therefore, just use regular LinqToObjects code for filtering and bind the IEnumerable result set.</P>
