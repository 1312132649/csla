Surely other folks besides me rolled their eyes when they grasped the magnitude of the effort that will be required.<br /><br />Please just drop a couple of the links here to those threads you liked and let a guy (who overslept and missed this party) catch up with the collective wisdom already shown here.    <br /><br /><br />Thanks to all,<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Massong replied on Wednesday, June 10, 2009</h2>A very good WPF blog is “Josh Smith on WPF”: <br />http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/2007/04/28/thinking-in-wpf/<br /><br />But I will not use WPF until Microsoft solves the blurry text problem in WPF:<br />http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wpf/thread/5289ee56-6d06-4f66-84f2-69865b6dc401</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Paul Czywczynski replied on Wednesday, June 10, 2009</h2>Microsoft is addressing the blurry text problem with DirectWrite.<br><br><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/text/archive/2009/04/13/directwrite-questions-and-answers.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/text/archive/2009/04/13/directwrite-questions-and-answers.aspx</a><br><br>Although you can manage it today by choosing your font type and size smartly.<br><br>-Paul<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Massong replied on Wednesday, June 10, 2009</h2>Hi Paul,<br /><br />Thank you for your reply. David Teitlebaum (MSFT) mentions in the forum post that I have linked:<br /><br />“The current plan is to ship WPF 4.0 Beta 2 with a vastly improved text rendering stack which will allow applications to set many more text rendering parameters than with previous versions of WPF. [...] When [this] glyph layout mode is selected in WPF, the rendered text should look nearly identical to GDI-rendered text.”<br /><br />In my opinion a text in the Courier New font of the VS2010 beta 1 XAML editor looks like written with an old typewriter (the characters look dirty).<br /><br />So I am looking forward to beta 2...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Fintanv replied on Wednesday, June 10, 2009</h2><P>I just came back from a two day (intensive) training session on WPF and the MVVM pattern for use in LOB apps.&nbsp; Sponsored by MS and taught by <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaimer/default.aspx">Jaime Rodriguez</A>&nbsp;and <A href="http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/">Karl Shifflett</A>&nbsp;in Phoenix.&nbsp; They have one stop left in Chicago.&nbsp; The days were long (8:30 am to 5:30 pm), but the material and instructors were top notch.&nbsp; The best part was that it was free and MS did not spare the expense account ;-).&nbsp; If you go to either of the above blogs you can get the slides and demos.</P>
<P>Take away message: WPF is full steam ahead for new applications.&nbsp; I have one nearing completion as we speak, backed with CSLA.</P>
<P>Good luck!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
