<P>I'm under the impression that a lot of resources are missing localization, namely the ActionExtender family. Do you need translators?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 24, 2009</h2><P>That is a good point. The last time I called for translators was probably 3.5 or maybe 3.6, and a lot has changed since then. It is very likely that most of the resource files are pretty out of date at this point.</P>
<P>So yes - if you would like to provide a translation of the 3.8 resource file in your language please grab the Resources.resx file, translate it and send me the resulting resx file.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Tuesday, November 24, 2009</h2>Well, not most; just a bit less than half... :)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
