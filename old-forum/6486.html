I am using VS 2008 (VB.NET) and CSLA.NET 3.6, at runtime i am changing my connection string and its working fine. My connection string is storing in app.config file so anybody can open and see my connection string. so I would like to secure my connection string which contains user name and password of SQL Server. Could anyone help me out!!!

Thanks

I think perhaps the best solution is to use remote objects using WCF services/web services.  This way the connection string is contained on the server.  The user would never even know what database they are hitting.  The data portal technology in CSLA makes this a fairly simple task.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
