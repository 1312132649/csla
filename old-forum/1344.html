My thinking is that it might be possible to subvert the application by calling Project.Resource.Add(ProjectResource badObject); with bad data? <br />Project.Resources.Add(invalidProjectResource) with a bad ProjectResource?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, September 27, 2006</h2>That's an interesting point. Resources must be public or you couldn't create the UIs in PTWin or PTWeb. However, it may make sense to have a check during the add process to ensure that the child object being added is a valid child for the given project.<br><br>I imagine you could override InsertItem() and check to ensure that the child's project id value matches that of the collection's parent.<br><br>This is an edge case though, because it isn't possible for the UI to directly create a ProjectResource. The factory/constructor methods are non-public. So to make this mistake you'd need to maintain a reference to a pre-existing ProjectResource from some other project and then try to add it to a different project, or something along that line.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
