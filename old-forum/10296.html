<p>I just purchased the CSLA 4 E-Book series. Not to be a bother but do you have a timeline for the release of the MVC portion (or the rest in general)? </p>
<p>The last post regarding these seem to be from the end of 2010 so&nbsp;I figured I&#39;d ping you for an update. :)</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Will</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, April 21, 2011</h2><p>My intent is to have at least the drafts of the remaining books online by the end of May. That might be unrealistic, but I&#39;ll be really pushing hard toward that goal over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The reason being that I also intend to take a sabbatical this summer (after 10 years at Magenic, employees get&nbsp;a 3 month sabbatical) - and so I&#39;m highly motivated to get the books done before that point so I can take full advantage of the sabbatical :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
