I'm starting to develop a corporate web application and I believe that this framework could help me a lot. However, I doubt that anyone would help me solve: <br /><br />I read that a philosophy of the framework is to use movible business objects. These objects belong to the business layer are used in the presentation layer to facilitate the creation of the user interface so as to obtain a better experience. My concern is What considerations should I take when designing  business object  for not having a strong interaction (fine-grained) between the presentation tier and business and incurring performance issues(data access object interactions and business logic server-side)<br /><br />thanks</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Sunday, April 12, 2009</h2>Well, in a web application, that already is done.  The presentation layer is the client browser and the business layer runs on the web server.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
