<P>My boss is a little concerned about the security vulnerablilities of Microsofts DTC service.&nbsp; Has anyone run into any potential problems using this with the .net transaction scope directive??&nbsp; Any insight is greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

When it does that, it becomes essentially the same as using Enterprise Services for transaction management.<br><br>To avoid triggering the DTC, you need to open one, and only one, connection to a SQL 2005 database within the context of your transaction. Then lightweight transactions will be used that don't use the DTC.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
