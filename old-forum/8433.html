The CSLA version is 3.6.  Is there any known issue with 3.6 not executing under server 2008?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Joe</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, January 28, 2010</h2><P>3.6 should work fine on Win2k8.</P>
<P>Assuming ASP.NET and IIS are properly configured, ASP.NET will simply look through the loaded assemblies (from the \bin directory) to find the matching full type name specified in the svc file.</P>
<P>Have you put an aspx page into the virtual root (with a little code in it) to establish that your virtual root is properly configured for ASP.NET?</P>
<P>Basically, make sure ASP.NET, IIS and your virtual root are properly configured, and that ASP.NET can read the \bin directory, etc.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jmcphers replied on Friday, January 29, 2010</h2>After continueing to work on this I came across the following post:<br /><br />This message is often due to an IIS 7 config problem. If you are used to creating a virtual directory pointing to the folder where your service resides, that no longer works. Now, you need to use the "Create Application..." option instead.  (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/720807/wcf-service-attribute-value-in-the-servicehost-directive-could-not-be-found)<br /><br />I made this configuration change and the page for http://localhost/WcfHost/wcfportal.svc now displays as expected.<br /><br />Thought I would pass this on.<br /><br />Joe</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
