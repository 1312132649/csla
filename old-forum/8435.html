Create "ObjectA", and set "MyProperty" value to a new instance of "MyProperty type";<br />2. When the user execute a method in "ObjectA" I replace "MyProperty valye" with a new object<br />3. Execute MarckClean() method on ObjectA.<br /><br />My problem is now, because ObjectA is still Dirty! I don't know why, but it is...<br /><br />Enrico</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, January 29, 2010</h2>Is the value you're putting in MyProperty a BusinessBase object?&nbsp; If it is, and you're creating it new, it will be dirty as well.&nbsp; Calling MarkClean on ObjectA will change the dirty state of ObjectA.. but not its child object (if that's what you have).</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>idroesse replied on Monday, February 01, 2010</h2>Hi guys.. I solve the problem and it was my fault! I didn't use DataPortal.FetchChild to populate MyProperty.. Now, when I put data into MyProperty using LoadProperty object is not dirty!!!<br />I'm feeling as newbie!!<br /><br />Thanks to all<br />Enrico</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
