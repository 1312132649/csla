<p>Let&#39;s say my model is kind of large in size (200K hit) and I provide for a child window that allows for the editing of a few properties that affect the same data backing as my large model. </p>
<p>When I leave the child window, I do a small asynchronous refresh of data within the model. This effectively changes properties on the ViewModel since some of them are conditional based on the Model.</p>
<p>I can easily implement the property changed (on my read only object) to refresh the entirety of the model by simply iterating over the registered properties as I load them in via my asynchronous refresh of part of the model.</p>
<p>However, I would like to do the same sort of thing on the ViewModel, rather than having to OnPropertyChanged everything individually. I just want to say ViewModel.RefreshBindings(), but I know there isn&#39;t such a magical method available to me.</p>
<p>I tried to unhook my ViewModel from my View and rehook it, but that didn&#39;t seem to work. Am I missing out on something intrinsic to the ViewModelBase/ViewModel class that would automatically do this for me? </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
