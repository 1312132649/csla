In this web application are several Silverlight applications. On another server I have a CSLA host running. The communication between the ASP .NET application and the host is done via WCF (nettcp binding), the Silverlight applications connect with the host via WCF (http binding).<br><br>The ASP .NET web application lets the user login on this CSLA host. The different Silverlight applications also need the user to be logged in to be able to fetch data from the CSLA host.<br>How can I let the Silverlight applications automatically login using the login data from the ASP .NET application?<br><br>I read somewhere that it can be easily done if the data portal is hosted in the same web app the user logged in to, but this is not the case here?<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
