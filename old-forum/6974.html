<P>A beginner question: where is the best place to select the default item in a RadioButtonList that is populated by a CslaDataSource?</P>
<P>I have a page with two radio button lists, each populated by its own CslaDataSource. The second list is being populated&nbsp;and shown after the user selects an item in the&nbsp;first list. My problem is, I want both lists to have the first item selected initially, but where do I put that code?</P>
<P>I have the dsList1_SelectObject where I could set the initial value for the first list, but I think a binding method is not the right place to do that?</P>
<P>I have the List1_SelectedIndexChanged where the second RadioButtonList is made visible and after that the DataBind is called for that second list. I think this is the right place to handle this dependency between the two radio button lists? </P>
<P>I have the dsList2_SelectObject where the second list is being populated with data depending on the selected value in the first list. Now I want to select the first item in the second list as the default item. Again, maybe this binding method is not the right place to do this?</P>
<P>Thank you very much for your help!</P>
<P>Kind regards, Jeroen<FONT size=2></P></FONT></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
