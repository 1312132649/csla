I haven&#39;t delved into SL yet, but I&quot;m hoping to in the very near future. For developing the business library, I was leaning toward the partial class method, and its reassuring to hear that it sounds like the way to go. </div></p>

<p>[quote user=&quot;Rocky&quot;]In the end, at least within the framework, the compiler directive approach is far superior. Having class code spread into 2-3 different files makes it too hard to find and maintain bits of code over time. And it makes it harder to manage the file linking. </div></p>
