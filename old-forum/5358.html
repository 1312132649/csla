Is there somewhere I could find updated templates? Or is that a project still in the works for some aspiring forum member ;). <br><br>It's pretty hard to get a good idea of the 'proper' structure that uses all the newest features of CSLA 3.5.

(I mean, look at the EditableChild template - there's no managed properties or Child_XYZ functions in there).<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
