<p>I would like to enquire as to the future&nbsp;roadmap w.r.t support for other mobile platforms like Android and iOS for building CSLA.NET solutions that run on devices like iPhones, iPads etc.&nbsp; With&nbsp;the future of the Mono platform now being in flux with Novell having&nbsp;fired&nbsp;the Mono team, is there still going to be a focus on getting this running on Mono support platforms?&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we rather consider switching over to building a HTML 5 solution to target these kinds of cross platform devices?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 25, 2011</h2><p>There&#39;s no way to provide a solid answer to this question until the events surrounding Attachmate and the new Xamarin company finish unfolding.</p>
<p>I do plan to release CSLA 4.2 in the near future, including the <em>now unsupported</em> MonoTouch and Mono for Android code we created. The actual Mono support remains unaffected by any of this, and is useful by itself because it allows the use of CSLA 4 on Linux and OS X.</p>
<p>In a few months we&#39;ll know more about the fate of Mono for iOS/Android, and I&#39;ll reevaluate my strategy at that time.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Russ replied on Wednesday, May 25, 2011</h2><p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>I was wondering about CSLA and Blackberry. Most of my customers employ armies of people carrying company provided Blackberrys. The companies are very interested&nbsp;in providing their employees with&nbsp;real-time&nbsp;access to their custom line-of-business applications.&nbsp; I have been following the rumours that RIM is working on Silverlight support on the Blackberry but I&#39;ve heard nothing official so far. Have you investigated bringing CSLA to the Blackberry?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 25, 2011</h2><p>CSLA requires .NET (or an open source equivalent like Mono). To my knowledge there is no .NET (of any sort) that runs on Blackberry?</p>
<p>That said, I&#39;ve been thinking about the &quot;core value&quot; of CSLA lately, especially in light of the hype around HTML 5 (H5). What if H5 somehow breaks the trend set by HTML 1-4 and becomes a consistent programming model for smart client development? I know this is a long shot, but this is what the hype is all about.</p>
<p>So what is the value proposition of CSLA in a world where the client-side programming model and language is H5/JavaScript, and the server-side programming model is C#/.NET?</p>
<p>(and keep in mind, I&#39;m not talking about web pages here, I&#39;m talking about a real smart client app written in H5)</p>
<p>Right away you can see that the same business layer code written in C# won&#39;t be useful in the client app. So the &quot;reuse the same business layer&quot; benefit of CSLA evaporates instantly.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s still the idea of objects encapsulating business, validation, and authorization rules. Were there a csla.js (or something), you could write your business layer in js, using some form of framework support similar to the .NET rules engine in CSLA 4. Of course you&#39;d also need to write the code in .NET for the server - but at least you&#39;d have a somewhat similar conceptual model to use while writing the code twice.</p>
<p>Along with the rules engine, there would have to be the idea of a broken rules collection, isvalid, isdirty, and other metastate tracking.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also the data portal. There are js libraries that abstract AJAX (lots of them actually). But I don&#39;t know if there are any that can transfer entire object graphs intact, including the metastate that would be involved.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#39;s that old, dusty &quot;mcsla&quot; project that used the now-defunct &quot;Oslo&quot; technology from Microsoft. Basically the idea of&nbsp;a high level domain specific language (for the CSLA domain) that you can use to describe (code) business types, such that the real C# or js code is created dynamically at runtime based on the &quot;code&quot; in that high level language.</p>
<p>The summary of all this rambling, is that if there&#39;s no consistent runtime, platform, base class library support, or language between the client and server parts of an app, then life sucks and software becomes expensive to create.</p>
<p>Yet another reason I am doubtful that H5 will conquer the world. (although the node.js project might help - because it allows js to run on the server - kind of solving the problem in reverse)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
