Is this possible? and if so please advise correct value to insert.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

(i.e. use the csladatasource in the CSLA traditional way -- just have the CSLA object invoke your Web service for you). </P>

<P>Is this the only option or are their alternatives? Which tier do you suggest to&nbsp;place the proxy object.</P>

<P>Much appreciated</P>
