<P>If "first time" literally means the very first change they ever make, then you'll need a flag in your object to record that the value has been changed, and then you can use that flag in your rule.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bgilbert replied on Tuesday, November 20, 2007</h2>Rocky,<br><br>First time means the first time they edit an existing object fetched from the db. <br><br>I'll implement a flag.
