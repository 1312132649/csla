<P>This new forum is great. <BR>Now it is time to&nbsp;think what sub-forums we want, instead to put all posts in a standard "General discussion".</P>
<P>Thanks Rocky</P>
<P>Cheers,<BR>Dominique</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ChrisD replied on Sunday, May 07, 2006</h2><P>Hi,</P>
<P>As Rocky said when he set us loose on the forum the other day i think we need to be very careful that we don't fragment this site so much that it's impossible to find anything.</P>
<P>We should be VERY sure that we need another top level forum before we all get carried away and fragment the reading matter here into loads of little sub sections that makes it more effort than it is worth.</P>
<P>My vote is for keeping things as they are until we truly need another top level grouping. <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></P>
<P>It's not up to me&nbsp;but the search engine on this will be very good and having many different top level groupings makes it bloody hard to read through the recent posts.</P>
<P>But that's only an opinion.</P>

<P>On the other hand, it would be nice for a logical breakdown, but doing it too soon could, and most likely will, make posting more combersome as you'll always ask yourself...&nbsp; humm... under which topic should I post this to better get an answer.&nbsp; Newbies will also have a more difficult time navigating around.</P>
<P>However, if it would be possible to have both a logical breakdown by topics (like you suggested we do this sooner rather than later) AND a combined list of threads regardless of in which topics they are in then I have no objections, but I'm not sure that we can do this with Community Server 2.0</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cjherasmus replied on Sunday, May 07, 2006</h2><P><FONT face=Verdana>Hi,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>accidentally posted this in reply to the wrong thread but here goes again:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>a suggestion maybe... two top level branches, i.e. CSLA 1.5x and CSLA 2.x, since there's a difference between them and it's a hassle to first go through the threads only to find out that it's about a different version of the CSLA.</FONT></P>

In case this can't be done right away, I would like also to suggest to all users using this forums to be specific on the version of CSLA and .NET Framework when posting a topic in order not to mislead other users.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Sunday, May 07, 2006</h2>Well, personally I like having all posts in one place because it's easier to get a quick look at what's going on... But as guyroch says, maybe there's a way of having different top level forums and a separate general view. That'd be nice.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Igor replied on Sunday, May 07, 2006</h2><P>I vote for a flat structure. </P>
<P>Even if having a flat view on multiple sub-forums is possible, I would not create more that&nbsp;two branches&nbsp;(CSLA 1.X and CSLA 2.0). Otherwise I'd prefrer to have everything in one place.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Henrik replied on Monday, May 08, 2006</h2><P>I concur with the flat approach but with seperate CSLA 1.x and a CSLA 2.x groups.</P>
<P>There will come a lot of questions regarding the new generic base classes in 2.0&nbsp;and having two seperate groups will prevent at lot of new threads with subject - "CSLA 1.5: ???" and "CSLA 2.0: ???" in the same group. Furthermore it will prevent eventual confusion about which version the questioner is talking about.</P>
<P>Anyway, I think a lot of us has get used to the superb archive search provided by Terrence Spencer for the CSLA 1.x, so if we can just get the same&nbsp; functionality out of the community server, I think that will be a good starting point.</P>
<P>Cheers<BR>Henrik</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Monday, May 08, 2006</h2><P>Well, maybe there's a way of making everybody happy. I don't know much about community server... no, sorry: I don't know anything about community server, but maybe some tagging or keywords feature can be implemented...</P>
<P>That way it's easy to create "views" for the ones that want separated content and to keep everything in one thread for the ones that don't.</P>
