I'm trying to find someone to help me maintain the c# templates for <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/CslaGenerator">CslaGen</a>. Anybody out there with some time on their hands?<br>
It's hard enough to maintain the app and vb templates and since VB is what I use at work, that's where my focus is.<br>
I hope to be able to put them on par with the VB ones and hopefully
make releases that have both sets of templates up to date, but I just
can't do it all by myself...<br><br><br>-- <br>Andr√©s
