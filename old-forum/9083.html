<p> I encountered a bug working with CSLA Light 3.8 and I tested on the 4.0 beta as well.</p>
<p>If I have an ERL as a model, removing the first child does not mark the view model&#39;s CanSave property.&nbsp; The second one triggers the CanSave though, but I suspect it is from the first change.</p>
<p>It does not seem to be the case with ECL because the root object&#39;s BusinessBase.OnAddEventHooks(IBusinessObject child) method registers the INotifyCollectionChanged and fires the proper notifications to the ViewModelBase.&nbsp; Not in ExtendedBindingList&lt;T&gt;.OnAddEventHooks(T item) though, not sure if this is by design or not.</p>
<p>Anyways if someone can confirm this, or point out my mistake, that would be awesome.</p>
<p>Sample test project attached.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

I found it about a week ago in CSLA 4 - but the ViewModelBase code is pretty much the same in 3.8. I&#39;ll fix it in 3.8.4 (if I haven&#39;t already).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
