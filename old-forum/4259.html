<P>dim _myString as String = String.Empty</P>
<P>Do I need to do the same thing to strings that exist in my criteria class as well?</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JohnB replied on Wednesday, January 30, 2008</h2><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Regan,<br><br>In your example, _myString would be "Nothing" without String.Empty. Strings act like reference types. So yes you want to initialize all strings with String.Empty where the object is marked as serializable.<br><br>Hope this help.<br><br>John<br></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, January 30, 2008</h2>Serialization doesn't require you to have non-null (Nothing) references before serializing.<br><br>I would suggest that it depends on who is consuming the criteria classes.&nbsp; They're usually private to the class in which they are used, so as long as the code getting values out of the criteria class can handle Nothing, there's no need to initialize.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the code would be simply by not ever having Nothings, then code it that way.&nbsp; I think its more of a personal preference myself.<br><br>For publicly visible types which I will be using in databinding, I like to set strings to Empty.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JohnB replied on Wednesday, January 30, 2008</h2><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>ajj3085:</strong></div><div>Serialization doesn't require you to have non-null (Nothing) references before serializing.</div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>I agree with your statement as well but I thought I <span class="255255419-30012008">remembered </span>reading

I'll continue to look as I am curious if it at all matters. But back to your point, I always initialize to String.Empty as a standard.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>simon_may replied on Wednesday, January 30, 2008</h2>I believe off the top of my head, that it&nbsp;is a requirement fot successful databinding, which does not like binding to nulls.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>reagan123 replied on Wednesday, January 30, 2008</h2><P>Thanks for the reply guys... <BR><BR>I did find and example of this in the criteria class in the book on pg. 78 or pg. 249&nbsp;and Rocky does not initialize the string in the Criteria class.&nbsp; I'm assuming this is the okay way to do it.</P>
<P>Thanks so much for the feedback.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 01, 2008</h2><P>The reason for initializing a string to string.Empty or "" is for data binding. Data binding doesn't like null values, and the default value for a string field is null/Nothing.</P>
<P>Most criteria objects are not data bound, so it doesn't matter if you initialize string fields. </P>
<P>That said, sometimes people do bind their criteria objects (to allow the user to specify options), in which case the fields would need to be initialized.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
