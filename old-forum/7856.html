Here is my property declaration:<br /><br />private static PropertyInfo(int?) ManagementCoIDProperty = RegisterProperty(int?)(typeof(CensusEdit), new PropertyInfo(int?)("ManagementCoID", new int?()));<br /><br /><br />Here is my set logic:<br /><br />        public int? ManagementCoID<br />        {<br />            get { return GetProperty(ManagementCoIDProperty); }<br />            set { SetProperty(ManagementCoIDProperty, value); }<br />        }<br /><br />If the value being passed into my Property is null I get an error saying:<br /><br />Property load or set failed for property ManagementCoID (Object reference not set to an instance of an object.)<br /><br />I have tried everything I can think of but still cannot get it to Set the property.  Load Property works fine but it does not fire the PropertyChanged event like I need it to.  Thanks for any help.<br /><br />Jonathan<br /><br /><br />Note:  I changed the syntax in the property declaration so you could see it.  For some reason I could not use a greater than and less than symbol in my post.  So I replaced them with parenthesis.<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, October 23, 2009</h2>Hmm, I do this, and it works fine, but I have Csla 3.7.1&nbsp; Might want to check if there's a change that fixes this.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
