<br>
I have a basic application design type question I have been going back
and forth on for quite sometime.&nbsp; We are creating a schedule
application where the main form consists of a grid containing
production items and a&nbsp; gantt chart containing&nbsp; the scheduled
departments for these production items.&nbsp;&nbsp; With in these
departments there are workcentre items.&nbsp; In the past, the old
version, we would load everything (very slow) and manipulate everything
in memory and on user demand (File|Save or on application close)
everything would be saved out to the database.&nbsp; Now that we are
rewriting it, I'd like to get some advice on what might be a better
approach.<br>
<br>
In general, would you get rid of the 'global save' and have all edits
update the database immediately?&nbsp; I can see then how we need to
build specific objects for each function (in this case, the edit/add
forms).&nbsp; In doing so, I'm a little concerned on how the main form
would get updated when the editing forms save and close.&nbsp; Like
what would the procedure be to reload a given object and not the entire
collection?<br>
<br>
The current structure mapped out at the moment is basically like our
old version but I can't help but think that this is just wrong.&nbsp;
One great big object and its children, grand children that get passed
between forms, etc...<br>
<br>
I'm very new to OO programming, love it, but get a little disoriented
and find myself going back to data centric design.&nbsp; Any insight,
links, literature recommendations, etc. would be grateful.<br>
