<p class=MsoNormal><span>Sure, you can.&nbsp; Asynchronous data portal can be used anywhere
now, in WPF, WInForm or WebForms.&nbsp; The question really is do you have a
scenario where you have an advantage of doing so?&nbsp; Typically, your forms
would load faster, but the user cannot use them until the data is fully loaded.&nbsp;
You can Save calls asynchronously as well, but you need to have a real good
strategy of handling errors from those calls, because the user can close the
form before save is actually completed, and then you have a problem&#8230;&nbsp;
Where they are extremely useful is in enabling you to provide animation for
long running fetch or save operations because your UI thread is free to do
whatever since portal calls are executing on background thread.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
