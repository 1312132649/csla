<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have come across an Application that uses a CSLA 1.1.&nbsp; It works very well in SQL 2000, code modification&nbsp;occurs in Visual Studio 2003.&nbsp; I was actually impressed at the thought that went behind the framework.&nbsp; We are planning to upgrade to SQL 2008.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get the application working in 2008 what path would you suggest.&nbsp; Upgrade CSLA or are there possible setting changes that need to be made.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>

So you can probably just change your code to bind to and use SQL Server 2008 with minimal impact.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
