How I can do this ?</p>
<p>I want to do this, so that I will unify all reference to new&nbsp;common business rules to be in&nbsp;one source, and make it easier to maintain.</p>
<p>What do you do to have the same result ?</p>
<p>I was thinking to use Partial Classes and the like, but it did not work.</p>

Create your own class library project, add a static class to that project and put your rules in that class.</p>
<p>I would not recommend using the Csla.Validation namespace. You should use your own namespace based on your organization and maybe application name.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
