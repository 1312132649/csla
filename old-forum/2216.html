developing a commercial winforms application.&nbsp; For the record, it may be ported 
someday to asp.net and even have components running on pocket pc.&nbsp; This is one 
reason, among others, that attracts me so strongly to the framework.&nbsp; But I am 
having trouble on deciding on a database engine.&nbsp; Keeping in mind that right now 
I am thinking of a COMMERCIAL WinForms APP and that deploying my app with sql 
express edition would be a total nightmare (50+ meg redist, permissions etc) and 
so I am thinking of other options.&nbsp; I have narrowed it down to 2 choices.&nbsp; The 
first is SQL Compact edition because it embeds right into the app and can be 
deployed with just a couple of files.&nbsp; The downside is that it has no native 
support for stored procs which is very limiting (although MS makes a decent case 
that this is not all bad).&nbsp; And I also know that I could use CSLA to do the data 
portal and just put the CRUD right into the portal code rather on the DB but my 
instinct is to not do it that way.&nbsp; Secondly, however, I am thinking of using 
the firebird DBMS because it is “embeddable” just like SQL compact edition but 
also can execute stored procs.&nbsp; In fact, it seems just right, except that it is 
a NEW engine and would require me to learn all of its particular oddities and 
differences and will have much less tool support (like CodeSmith templates for 
example).&nbsp; So the learning curve is scaring me a bit. <br><br><br>What&nbsp; would you do?<br><br>Seth<o:p></o:p></span></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Saturday, January 27, 2007</h2><P>I would use <FONT face=Arial size=2>SQL compact edition myself.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SP support is not critical. I only use a handful of them right now on regular SQL Server.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I have separate classes to support the SQL code. Basically one class per table. So I can get the SQL from it using code like:&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SQLForTable1.Delete(id As Integer)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>etc.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>This keeps the DataPortal code neat and clean.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I also have a DataAccess Layer so the ADO.Net code is also abstracted out of the DataPortal.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>dr = DAL.ExecuteReader(SQLForTable1.SelectAll)</FONT></P>
