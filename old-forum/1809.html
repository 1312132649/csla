An example of the single parent-single child (i.e. 1-to-1 relation) would be a PC that has a single Keyboard (sorry, I was looking around me for inspiration, this is just the first thing that come to mind ;-D ). This is of course assuming that your particular application has a use case where a keyboard can not go without its corresponding PC (I know, it's not a compelling example, but it gives you the idea).<br><br>Bayu<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DougZ replied on Wednesday, November 22, 2006</h2>Bayu,<br><br>OK, I think I've got it.&nbsp; An Editable Child object can be used in a collection of Editable Child objects (i.e. an Editable Child List) owned by its parent object (e.g. a PC has a USBPortList consisting of USBPort objects), or an Editable Child object can be used for a single object whose existence depends on its parent object (e.g. a PC has a Keyboard).&nbsp; The difference seems to just be in the multiplicity of the relationship.&nbsp; Right?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Doug<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bayu replied on Wednesday, November 22, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/alternate1/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>DougZ:</strong></div><div>Bayu,<br><br>OK, I think I've got it.&nbsp; An Editable Child object can be used in a collection of Editable Child objects (i.e. an Editable Child List) owned by its parent object (e.g. a PC has a USBPortList consisting of USBPort objects), or an Editable Child object can be used for a single object whose existence depends on its parent object (e.g. a PC has a Keyboard).&nbsp; The difference seems to just be in the multiplicity of the relationship.&nbsp; Right?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Doug<br></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>Correct.<br><br><img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /><br><br><br><br>Bayu<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DougZ replied on Tuesday, November 21, 2006</h2>Here's an example.&nbsp; This comes from onelittlevictory describing Editable Child objects:<br><br>"An Editable Child Object is used to populate an editable collection of objects contained
    in a parent object OR when a fully functional editable object needs to be contained
    within a parent root object."<br><br>So, the first situation would be like an Invoice with an InvoiceItemList populated with InvoiceItem objects ... the InvoiceItem objects are Editable Child objects, right?&nbsp; Can someone give me an example of "a fully functional editable object (that) needs to be contained within a parent root object"?&nbsp; Also, shouldn't it just say, "within a parent object," since an object can be a child of a child?&nbsp; <br><br>Thanks,<br>Doug<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Tuesday, November 21, 2006</h2><P>Doug, take a look at this link as well</P>
