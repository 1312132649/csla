This class is then inherited by all my other businessbase type classes.<br /><br />I want to handle/process an exception when one is thrown inside the dataportal fetch. <br /><br />For the Save, I can override the save and add my code there, but can't seem to get it to work with fetch. <br /><br />I see there is an onDataPortalException event, but not sure if this is the correct place to use.<br /><br />By exception handling I mean I will be raising a more specific exception or letting it bubble up. <br /><br />Any help is appreciated, thx.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
