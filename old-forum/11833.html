<p>Would anyone be willing to point me to some examples or particular methodologies you&#39;ve seen or used to document rules? What I&#39;m looking for is a format that could be used as a future master reference for what rules impact the various business actions, how they&#39;re related to one another, order of priority, etc.</p>
<p>It will likely take us weeks to go through the many thousands of lines of VB6 code as well as stored procs littered with rules and write them down in an appropriate way. And before I just start putting them into a hastily created Word document, I&#39;m trying to find out if there are standardized approaches to this kind of thing. We could use something like Visio to show a graphical representation of them, but I&#39;m not sure if that is the best way to go about it since that isn&#39;t really a &quot;reference&quot; that someone could easily pick up and find information about a particular rule.</p>
<p>I&#39;d appreciate any insight. Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>tiago replied on Tuesday, February 12, 2013</h2><p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>I like the way Behavior Driven Development people document business rules.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Tuesday, February 12, 2013</h2><p>Thanks, Tiago. Do you have any examples or links that demonstrate their documentation format?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, February 13, 2013</h2><p>Look at this: <a href="http://www.brcommunity.com/b282.php">http://www.brcommunity.com/b282.php </a></p>
<p><i>&quot;In September 2005, the Object Management Group (OMG) approved
			the &quot;Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules&quot; (SBVR)</i><a href="http://www.brcommunity.com/b282.php#fn1"><span style="font-size:x-small;"><sup>[1]</sup></span></a><i> to become a final adopted
			specification of the OMG.</i>&nbsp; SBVR, which is the first OMG standard for fact
			models and business rules, is in finalization as of this writing.<br />
			<br />
			SBVR is a highly-structured set of fundamental concepts, not a syntax for rule representation.&nbsp;
			In part, this approach is necessary for multi-lingual support; in part, it is to
			ensure support for a variety of representational schemes.&nbsp; One such scheme is
			RuleSpeak<sup>&reg;</sup>, which played a central role in the shaping and proofing
			of the standard itself.&nbsp; The material that follows is extracted from the RuleSpeak
			Annex of SBVR.&quot;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
