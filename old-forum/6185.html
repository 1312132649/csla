<P>Now, I look at line 9 and it is as follows: <BR><FONT color=#0000ff size=2><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>&lt;</FONT></FONT><FONT color=#a31515 size=2><FONT color=#a31515 size=2>l:VisibilityConverter</FONT></FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2><FONT color=#0000ff size=2> </FONT></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>x:Key</FONT></FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>=</FONT></FONT><FONT size=2>"</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>VisibilityConverter</FONT></FONT><FONT size=2>"</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2><FONT color=#0000ff size=2> /&gt;<BR><FONT color=#000000 size=3>and all seems to be ok.&nbsp; And yes, I did add the class VisibilityConverter.vb to the file.&nbsp; Initially I had not added that file and was getting the error.&nbsp; I added the file and am still getting the error.&nbsp; Also, I do have the xmlns:l="clr-namespace:SampleApp" line at the top.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I know it is something to do with the XAML parser based on the error, but if someone could steer me in the right direction of where to look other than the obvious things which I have already checked out, please let me know.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, I usually got this error and then copied in the correct Page.xaml code and it went away, but that didn't work now and I think I need to be able to figure this out for future problems, which I know I will run into!&nbsp; Gotta love this stuff!</P>
