<P>Frankly, they are examples. If you like them, use them. If you don't like them, create your own library of rule methods.</P>
<P>Every now and then people send me new rules, and that's fine. But I don't intend to expand CommonRules beyond where it is (with the possible exception of adding StringMinLength), because I don't want to get in the business of maintaining a huge library of rules.</P>
<P>What I keep hoping will happen is that there'll be a CslaContrib.dll that includes CslaContrib.Validation.CommonRules on the codeplex site - that'd be a nice home for a broader library of rule methods, and I wouldn't have to maintain them <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
