<P>I&nbsp;wouldn't use&nbsp;the second approach, it looks less readable since you perform a fetch on object A while really you are performing that action on object B and then copying the values.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, June 08, 2009</h2>You should try out the DataMapper class to copy the values from one BO to another. It is quite flexible and it also has an excluded properties list.<br />Joe<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>whelzer replied on Monday, June 08, 2009</h2>Spot on.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; DP_Create makes much more sense.<br><br>Edit:&nbsp; Joe I'm using v 3.0.4 is the DataMapper avilable to me.&nbsp; Ta<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>whelzer replied on Monday, June 08, 2009</h2>Just checked out the DataMapper p285 2005 VB Book.&nbsp; Superb piece of functionality! <br>Don't know why I never came across it before.&nbsp; Glad I didn't write all 90 lines out... <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
