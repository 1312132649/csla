There appears to be a bug when I press the "Delete" button. The selected Product to be deleted does not get removed from the list and when clicking on it I get&nbsp;a "DataPortal.Fetch failed (Sequence contains no elements)" error. When restarting the app the item is removed so the deletion does happen.</P>
<P>It appears the refresh on the <FONT color=#a31515 size=2><FONT color=#a31515 size=2>"ProductList"&nbsp;<FONT color=#2b91af size=2><FONT color=#2b91af size=2>CslaDataProvider </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>resource does not refresh correctly. I tried to debug it but the code won't step in InvDal. Tried to fire another instance of VS2008 setting the InvDal or InvLib.Server projects as startup and attatching to Cassini but I get an error message "Unable to attach to process. A debugger is already attached".</P>
<P>Apologies if this is a known issue or if this is something silly from my part but some guidance on how to step through this would be great!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, March 30, 2009</h2>The InventoryDemo is very much a work in progress and is changing fairly rapidly, so it could have issues at any given point in time. I appreciate the feedback though, and I'll take a look at delete when I get a chance.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
