<p>We are using CSLA Version 1.0.0.0 as per CSLA.dll<br />We are currently facing problems with oversized ViewState on pages that uses DataGrid and GridViews.<br /><br />I need to disable ViewState on datagrid, that uses selectedindexchanges, pageindexchanged, sort command, itemdatabound and itemcreated events.<br /><br />Some of these causes issues aspecially sort command, as it doesn&#39;t remember Header Text with &quot; ^&quot; and &quot; v&quot; symbols on post-back.<br /><br />How can I achieve this. Please provide sample code as I am novice user for CSLA.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
