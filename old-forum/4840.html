If I use something like _LastModifiedDateTime.ToString("g") which outputs the information like D-MM-YYYY HH:MM (using Australian local) this exactly how I want it formatted, but the sorting is all wrong when using any any grid control (primarly DevExpress XtraGrid). <br><br>Therefore what I've done is set the default text format for SmartDates to be "s", and am exposing a SmartDate property. In the CustomColumnDisplayText event I then change the displaytext to be SmartDate.ToString("g") or whatever format is correct. This then sorts the dates perfectly, can anyone think of any reason why this would be a bad thing? <br><br>This 'pattern' if you want to really abuse the word, would only be used on readonly properties for lists. Therefore I don' t have to worry about users entering anything invalid or null dates.<br><br>Marjon<br></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, May 14, 2008</h2>Ok, I may be way off base here, but I'll throw out the idea and you may find I'm right, or you'll find nothing because I'm wrong.. but..<br><br>I think SortedBindingList will handle this for you.&nbsp; Are you wrapping your ROLB in a SBL before handing it to the binding source / grid?<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
