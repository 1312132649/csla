At first glance it all looks fine and dandy, but given that we want to use CSLA I am wondering if this just complicates things further :-/<br><br>Anyone with experience combining clsa + netsqlazman (cause thats the approach we want to try, storing things in a sql server database)? Oh, and we are making a website using forms (asp.net) for authentication.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
