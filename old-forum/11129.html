<p>there is no CSLA .NET Data Helpers for Windows Phone? Windows Phone supports Linq To SQL CE. I think that ContextManager, DataMap, DataMapper and maybe TransactionManager should be included in Csla.Data for Windows Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I hope it will include support&nbsp; for synchronous data portal methods.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 09, 2012</h2><p>It will not include support for synchronous data portal concepts, no. The idea of synchronous file or database IO is on its way out. </p>
<p>The new Windows Runtime (WinRT) in Windows 8 (and then Windows Phone 8 if rumor is correct) doesn&#39;t allow synchronous file or database IO. </p>
<p>No sense supporting a concept that is soon to be entirely gone.</p>
<p>In fact, what is <em>more</em> likely is that the .NET data portal will be changed to support async - though that&#39;ll almost certainly be done in a way that relies on the async/await keywords in .NET 4.5.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mesh replied on Thursday, February 23, 2012</h2><p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>I&#39;m reading Using CSLA 4.0: Windows Phone and can not understand how should I implement ProjectGetter&#39;s GetExistingProject method when using local database? There is no synchronous DataPortal_Fetch available. </p>
<p>So, how can I implement async DataPortal_Fetch(Criteria criteria,&nbsp;<span>Csla.DataPortalClient.LocalProxy&lt;ProjectGetter&gt;.CompletedHandler handler) method and load Project and RoleList in it?</span></p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 23, 2012</h2><p>There is no synchronous data portal in Silverlight, or the phone.</p>
<p>However, the client-side DataPortal_Fetch is not <em>inherently</em> asynchronous. It is invoked synchronously by the data portal. The requirement is that <em>your code</em> must invoke the callback handler when the method is complete.</p>
<p>The primary idea here is that you&#39;d make an async call to a service, and when that call completes you&#39;d invoke the handler.</p>
<p>But there is absolutely nothing stopping you from making a synchronous data access call and then calling the handler. Other than when your users get upset with your app anyway... Because if you do this, you&#39;ll block the user. I actually don&#39;t know exactly how badly, but probably badly.</p>
<p>What you <em>should</em> do is use a BackgroundWorker from the Csla.Threading namespace to do the data access on a background thread, and to invoke the callback handler when the background task completes. That way you won&#39;t block the user because your synchronous data access will run on that background thread.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mesh replied on Friday, February 24, 2012</h2><p>Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
