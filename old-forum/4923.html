I just added the CSLA 3.0.4 dll to my project.&nbsp; When I did this I got the error " 'Forms' is not a member of 'Windows'." on the following line of code.<br><br>Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show("This report is under development.")<br><br>Why do I have to qualify my line of code with "System.Windows..."?&nbsp; Anyone know if CSLA is causing this...?&nbsp; I know there are a lot of variables to this so it may be hard to pinpoint.&nbsp; Any ideas of what may be causing this?<br><br>It's not really a big deal... just curious as to what may be causing this to happen.<br><br>Thanks!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, June 02, 2008</h2><P>It is likely that you have a namespace conflict. There is a Csla.Windows namespace, and perhaps if you import/use Csla and (of course) System then the compiler can't resolve the namespace?</P>
<P>I typically import/use System.Windows if I'm building a UI using that technology.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeveloperDan replied on Monday, June 02, 2008</h2><P>Five minutes ago we solved this same problem on a co-worker's pc.&nbsp; I'll save you the time and hassle we went through...&nbsp; </P>
<P>Simply download and install&nbsp;Service Pack 1&nbsp;for Visual Studio 2005 --&nbsp;you're problem will go away!&nbsp; I don't have the link handy, but I believe you can search for VS&nbsp;version 50727.762 or knowledge base article KB928957.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Good luck!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>reagan123 replied on Monday, June 02, 2008</h2>Thanks everyone... I'll look into both suggestions.&nbsp; I know it was a small thing that didn't really matter, but I was just curious.<br><br>Thanks again!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
