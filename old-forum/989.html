<P>I tried calling bindingsource.canceledit,&nbsp; but still have the issue.</P>
<P>Any suggestions?</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

Inside the collection, when notification of a delete request comes through, the code deletes the object - but it sounds like the edit level is still &gt;0 at that point...<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mikeclimbs replied on Wednesday, August 23, 2006</h2><P>I'm starting a large app with many grids pointing at EditableRootListBase and&nbsp;would be glad to help you test this, once&nbsp;the issue is resolved.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Mike</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, August 23, 2006</h2>I appreciate that very much.<br><br>If you could grab the latest version of ERLB.vb in cvs and give it a try that would be great. You'll need updated versions of Core\BusinessBase.vb and Core\IEditableBusinessObject.vb as well - I had to change those slightly to get this resolved.<br><br>I had tested this through unit tests, but that's obviously not enough to catch all the idiosyncratic behaviors of data binding... I think I now have it working correctly within data binding as well.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mikeclimbs replied on Wednesday, August 23, 2006</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>Grabbed the latest and the delete is working correctly.&nbsp; I did a quick test of add, edit, delete and they all worked.</P>
<P>I will do more testing this afternoon and post my results.</P>
<P>Thanks for the quick response.</P>

<P>I did some additional testing today with standard VB components and devexpress components and everything worked great.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
