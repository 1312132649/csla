<P>I have been considering using CSLA with NHibernate, however I am not too keen on NHibernate if only for the reason that all the documentation is written from a Java centric perception.</P>
<P>I am very keen on using LINQ however as most of my years of programming are from a Microsoft centered (C, C++, C#) approach.&nbsp; I have in fact been playing around with LINQ quite a bit and like it a lot.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Therefore I have a few questions for you experts here.&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
<LI>Is LINQ a good mix with CSLA.</LI>
<LI>Do you see LINQ replacing NHibernate in the near future</LI>
<LI>Is anybody currently using CSLA and LINQ with Dependency Injection</LI>
<LI>Are there any good example projects that use CSLA and LINQ</LI>
<LI>Are there any good example projects that use CSLA and NHibernate</LI></OL>
