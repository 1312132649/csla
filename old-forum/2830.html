<P>No, there is no such notification in CSLA. You'll need to do it yourself as you describe.</P>
<P>Better yet, if you subclass all the CSLA base classes (which I recommend as a best-practice), you could implement this concept into your new base classes. That's only a good idea, though, if you need this sort of behavior across many/most of your objects. If you just need it in this one collection then you are best off doing it in the collection/child objects themselves.</P>

<P>That is correct - this only applies to new child objects that are removed from a grid control, and even then really only in .NET 1.x, or if you use .NET 1.x style data binding in .NET 2.0.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
