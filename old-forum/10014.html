<p>We may be offering a demo hosted software solution on this server based on CSLA and it&#39;s early days yet but I&#39;m wondering if any part of CSLA is going to require that Application Server role if we are offering a service interface through WCF.&nbsp; It seems to impact on WCF but I can&#39;t determine if it will affect CSLA usage or not.</p>
<p><br />I&#39;ve tried searching for this here and other places but Rocky&#39;s use of the term Application Server and &quot;role&quot; in another context has made it difficult to search for.&nbsp; </p>

<ol>
<li>Microsoft .NET</li>
<li>FullTrust in .NET</li>
<li>Some http listener (usually IIS or now maybe AppFabric)</li>
</ol>
<p>The standard &quot;web server&quot; role is sufficient to get those things.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Wednesday, February 02, 2011</h2><p>Thanks Rocky, appreciate it.</p>
