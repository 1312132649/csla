<P>We are looking for&nbsp;two CSLA 2.X proficient developers for a 2-3 month contract to help us complete a large internal project.&nbsp; We can't seem to find any developers&nbsp;through&nbsp;our regular recruiting channels who are familiar with the framework.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If anyone knows of someone who might fit the bill, or is interested please let me know.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are located in San Jose, CA and we're looking for on-site contractors who can start immediately.</P>
<P>Regards,</P>
