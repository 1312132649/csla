It is windows form and there are no values added in app config for propertychanged mode so by default it should be windows..<br /><br />I'm not sure whether it is a bug or am I missing something..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Monday, June 29, 2009</h2>Further to my previous msg.. this is only happenning when property is dispalyed in a textbox.<br /><br />In DataGridview shortcuts are getting displayed properly even with managed fields..<br /><br />This is how I have delcared the property..<br /><br />private static PropertyInfo <B>&amp;lt;</B>SmartDate> DateOfBirthProp =<br />        RegisterProperty(p => p.DateOfBirth);<br /><br />        public string DateOfBirth<br />        {<br />            get { return GetPropertyConvert(DateOfBirthProp); }<br />            set {<br />                    SetPropertyConvert(DateOfBirthProp, value); <br />                }<br />        }</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, June 29, 2009</h2>I just tried ProjectTracker with the Windows Forms UI and its SmartDate-related properties are refreshing properly when compiled using 3.6.3.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Monday, June 29, 2009</h2>I have checked my code mutliple times and not able to understand why it is not refreshing..<br /><br />Is there any thing else which I can check which can make this problem..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, June 29, 2009</h2>The refresh would be triggered by the PropertyChanged event raised when the property is changed. I suppose you could manually add a PropertyChanged event handler and use the debugger to make sure you are getting the event as expected.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Tuesday, June 30, 2009</h2>I chkd the code in debugger and saw that propertyhaschanged event is getting triggered. It is expanding the shortcuts like ., + etc. and comparing both values and values are differing so it is raising propertyhaschanged but after that I was not able to track how bindingsourcerefresh is re-reading values..<br /><br />I also noticed one more thing that my form is only using bindingsourcerefresh and not readwriteauthorization. I don't know if that makes any difference..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Saturday, July 11, 2009</h2>Can any additional help be provided on this issue. Now this is occuring in almost all the forms..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tetranz replied on Saturday, July 11, 2009</h2>I've had forms where BindingSourceRefresh has stopped working. Deleting the component from the form and adding it again in the VS designer always fixes it for me.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
