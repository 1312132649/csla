<P>Each client will have a separate set of DataBases.&nbsp; Since there is a single web.config in a virtual directory, does that mean that each user ought to have their own separate virtual directory (and hence a separate App installation)?&nbsp; One can have multiple Application Pools in a virtual directory, but I am not sure if or how that will help with the Connections Strings.</P>
<P>Will appreciate any suggestions.</P>

<P>This is actually the first time I've ever heard the term SaaS before, so if my advice is terrible please disregard it.&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading your thread and an overview of what a SaaS is, it sounds like your concern is how to store the different user's connection strings.&nbsp; I think I would put a connection string in your web.config for a "master" database that housed information about the user and the name/connection string to his/her database.&nbsp; Then you could read that information in from this master database and use it to create a connection to the correct user database.&nbsp; If this is all you are trying to accomplish, I don't think you need to create multiple application pools.&nbsp; Maybe somebody else can chime in and discuss the possible issues, if there are&nbsp;any,&nbsp;that you may face by&nbsp;using a single application pool.</P>

<P>Your idea has merit.&nbsp; I suppose the aspnetdb can be extended to include the connectionString information in the user table. One will have to devise a sound way to cache this information in order to avoid a trip to this DB everytime the connection string is needed.&nbsp; Separation of one user's data from the other is critical for us - hence the need for a foolproof method to keep the two users' connectionStrings from contaminating each other.</P>

<P>As Bayu suggested, I would use your own DB as well.&nbsp; By master I only meant that it be the "central" database, if you will, that would hold your connection/user information&nbsp;to the other user specific databases.&nbsp; I'm not all that well versed in&nbsp;asp.net as most of my work revolves around WinForms applications, but I think you could store the connection information in a cookie, session,&nbsp;or the like.</P>

<P>With the grief that the aspnetdb has caused me in the past six months, I must be a glutton for punishment to be still trying to use it.&nbsp; I think you are right - it is probably a lot easier to create one's own database and have better control over what it does.&nbsp; Thanks.</P>
