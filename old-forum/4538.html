<P><FONT face=Arial>I've set up the databindings on my forms "the easy way" (meaning dragging and dropping from the Data Sources window) and everything ties up together wonderfully.&nbsp; I've added an ErrorProvider control with it's DataSource to the binding source and a BindingSourceRefresh control with ReadValuesOnChanged set to true.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The validations from the object seem to fire off correctly, since I get the red exclamation icon next to the controls, however, I cannot for the life of me get it to show the description of the broken rules on the mouse-over tool tip.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>I found this previous thread which aluded to the issue</FONT></P><A HREF="/forums/thread/18707.aspx"><FONT face=Arial>http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/18707.aspx</FONT></A><BR>
<P><FONT face=Arial>but didn't mention any real way of resolving it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>For now, all my rules are per-type rules with the default severity (which I believe is Error) which means it <EM>should</EM> be displaying them, right? However it's not.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Any ideas?</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, March 24, 2008</h2>are you sure you're setting e.Description if the validation fails?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Carlos replied on Monday, March 24, 2008</h2>Most of my rules are of the CommonRules type (MaxLength, StringRequired, etc.)  I don't need to set a description for those, do I?<br /><br />For my custom rules, I am setting the Description, and even the FriendlyName property, which is why I'm puzzled.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
