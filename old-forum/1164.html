<P>With the new Type style business rules, does it handle inheritence? Such that the if I am validaitng a subclassed business object I will also get it's base validation type rules as well, or because they a different types will it not include them? Or does it check for base types as well.</P>
<P>Thanks<BR>John</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>Yes, that works fine. The reason is because your rules are added in AddBusinessRules() in each class. Your subclass does, of course, have to call base.AddBusinessRules() so the base class can add its rules to the list - but the result is a merged list of all rules up the inheritance chain.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
