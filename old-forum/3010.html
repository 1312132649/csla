<P>I have an app written in vb.net using vs2003 and clsa 1.4.</P>
<P>I intend to upgrade to vs2005 and then use clsa 2.1.4. (for future enhancements)</P>
<P>Does anyone have advice/guidance/hints/views etc&nbsp;to doing something like this i.e. running both clsa versions from one app (is it possible for instance).</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>So far i tried chaning a single child object to Csla2 and it works fine even though it's a child of complex CSLA [1.5] graph.&nbsp; I can't see any reason why it wouldn't.</P>
<P>Some tips on what the baso changes to get it working would be good.</P>
