The viewmodel class is created with a type which is a business object, but the list of a combobox isn&#39;t a part of that business object. The usercontol (View) uses a collectionviewsource, I have tried putting mutplie collectionviewsources on a View, but the only collectionviewsource that gets populated is the one that is passed with the call to showview. Could someone explain how I should have the second collectionviewsource populated, or maybe how to structure the viewmodel so that the combobox on the view can get populated with a section list.</p>
<p>An example if someone has one would be great.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, September 13, 2010</h2><p>Add a property to your VM which contains the list of items in the to put in the combobox.&nbsp; Then, create a command based object which will retreive the BO you&#39;re editing as well as a ROLB or NVL of these items, and use that command object to fetch both the list and BO at once.&nbsp; Then just wire up the results when the VM is refreshed.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
