<p>I am getting further in my Silverlight prototype and have a question
pertaining to security.&nbsp; I am prototyping my application after the
Rolodex, however, I have a couple of differences in my security database (which
the Rolodex example has the security tables in the Rolodex db).<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I have a BASSecurity database with a Role table and a Users table.&nbsp; My
role table is comprised of a RoleId int and a RoleName varchar (30)
field.&nbsp; My Users table is comprised of a UserId int, Username varchar(15),
Password varchar (15) field, FirstName field, etc.&nbsp; I also have a
UsersRole table which is comprised of RoleId int and UserId int and have sprocs
to return the valid roles upon a correct entry of a userid and password.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I noticed the Rolodex example put the security tables in the main database
and I have been stepping through the GetCslaIdentity&lt;BasIdentity&gt;(...)
for a while and am having a hard time figuring out where the selects are in the
code that gets the valid userid and password from the table.&nbsp; Oh I also
put the additional connection string for the security database in the
DataConnection class.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>If all else fails, I will put the security tables my main database instead
of having the security database as that complicates things, but I will have to
figure out how things work anyway, so I may as well beat my head against the
wall now!&nbsp; So, any ideas on where the validation occurs for a valid user
and password would be most helpfull.<o:p></o:p></p>
