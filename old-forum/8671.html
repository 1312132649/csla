<p>For example I have an Employee class that has a child BLB of Absences (EmployeeAbsences), I have then got an EmployeeAbsenceMonth class which has a child BLB of the same type for each day of the month. </p>
<p>I&#39;m aware that this might seem slightly odd but I need to bring the data
 into such a class in order to be able to bind a DataGridView to it.</p>
<p>The child objects only ever exist in one list,&nbsp; separate copies are created for each parent.</p>
<p>The reason i ask is that i get a stack overflow exception when i call the .Parent property of EmployeeAbsences.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
