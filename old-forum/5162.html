<P>I need to be able to validate that at least one item has been added to an Editable Child List.</P>
<P>What is the best way to do this?</P>

<P>You may add a custom validation rule for the child collection in your parent object, where you have to check just the count of editable child collection.</P>

I'm going to check out both ideas.<br><br>ajj3085... That sounds like the approach i'd like to try, but I have no idea how to implement it.&nbsp; Any tips or links to how this is done?<br><br>I appreciate all of the feedback.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
