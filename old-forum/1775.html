<br>
I am trying to figure out how to implement a Command Object under CSLA
1.5 for VB.NET 2003. All I need to do is expose a shared method that
takes in a record ID and a boolean value, allowing the Object to access
the DB to set the boolean value of the specified ID to true or false.
It seems like the pre-2.0 and pre-.NET 2005 editions of CSLA do not
support this object. Is this correct? I have not been able to find any
sample code for this.<br>
<br>
Thank you - any help would be appreciated.<br>
