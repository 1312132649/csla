<P>No, this is the only way to add per-instance rules currently.</P>
<P>In CSLA 4 I intend to do some pretty substantial changes to the business rules subsystem - something for discussion on its own thread later.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fsl replied on Monday, January 04, 2010</h2>Thank you for the quick reply..<br /><br />I'm now overriding AddInstanceBusinessRules() and rules using methods defined in the enclosing class are executed.

<P>Any external rules would need to be public in scope, and would need to remain in scope through the life of the app. In other words, they'd need to be static, or be methods off a singleton or something.</P>
<P>At least that's my recollection. I haven't looked at or used instance rules since 2005, so my memory of the details could be a little fuzzy.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
