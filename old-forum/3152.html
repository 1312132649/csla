Has anyone had experience with Mono and CSLA, and any idea how this would tie in with Apache (if it is needed at all that is)?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>So if you can get CSLA .NET to build under mono, you could probably use mono clients to talk to mono servers, but you can't mix and match .NET and mono in this regard.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
