<P>I've just come across an issue I can't quite figure out.&nbsp; I have an object with a child collection, and I have created a custom Rule to make sure the object is not saveable unless it has at least one child in the child collection.&nbsp; I used the ListChanged event of the parent's child collection property to fire the ValidationRules.CheckRules method (got this from another post) when a child is added or removed and that all works great.&nbsp; If I remove all children from the collection the object becomes invalid and I can't save it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The problem is that I want to use the error provider to display the error next to the ListBox that I have bound to the child collection.&nbsp; The trouble with this is that binding to a child collection creates a second bindingsource.&nbsp; You link the error provider to a binding source, but if I link it to the parent it doesn't know which control to display the error icon against, and if I link to the child collection binding source it doesn't know there is an error - preumably because the validation is on the parent object?&nbsp; Is there a way to achieve what I want and have the error provider correctly show this error next to my listbox?&nbsp; Hope this makes sense.</P>
<P>TIA</P>
