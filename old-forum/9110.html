<p>In other words, I surely wouldn&#39;t use the Collective code as a basis for anything - it is best viewed as a prototype of what later became some really good ideas.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JJLoubser replied on Monday, August 23, 2010</h2><p>we use the bxf as our navigation system, it works better than the navigation system introduce by silverlight 3 frame and pages, because it easily connects views to viewmodels to business objects...</p>
<p>we still cannot wait for your videos of&nbsp;CSLA 4, for we struggle a bit with the Auth Rules delete&nbsp;instance of object, also we do not know if our way of implementing Bi rules and Auth Rules is 100% correct&nbsp;but it works fine... also we want to upgrade a uge project from 3.8 to 4, because telerick controls &amp; Hierarchiel binding&nbsp;templates&nbsp;work very much powerfull with silverlight 4 and CSLA 4 and viewmodels...</p>
