<P>Do I need to&nbsp;create an object for both? I lazy load the one, so both&nbsp;won't be a huge teaser in the Fetch.</P>
<P>I couldn't&nbsp;prove&nbsp;that simplified D&amp;D operations.&nbsp;*Something* needs to help synchronize and&nbsp;I've only trialed it with list boxes. Grids are failing and I think this is behind it.</P>

Then there's a subset of A that is associated with the user (Au) and of course another subset that is not associated with the user (A')?</P>
<P>You bind Au to a grid for display, and want to have a display for A'?</P>
<P>Certainly you could have two lists for this purpose, but I wonder if you aren't better off having one list (A) and then two views (Au and A'). These views would, in fact, be different objects - but they'd merely be filters against the actual A. So the only thing you'd get from the database would be A - and of course the identifiers (key values) needed to filter to create Au.</P>
<P>Just a thought anyway.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>esteban404 replied on Thursday, May 11, 2006</h2><P>Thanks, Rockford. That's kind of what I did. This is primarily for the Designers themselves. Loading their own work was not enough, loading everyones was too much.</P>
<P>I ended up creating a single object (Au), bound it to a grid and away it went. I saw you know DevExpress, so I use a repository lookup edit in the grid to which I bind Au. That leaves all of the Designers available in the list,&nbsp;and the collection prevents duplicates. I just lazy load it and let the user take care of knowing what they want. Hope that's not a mistake. ;-]</P>
