<P>I'd like to see examples of these sames files, but split into partial class and base class versions.&nbsp; Are such examples available anywhere?</P>

<P>Partial classes are really no different from normal classes except they have a partial keyword which allows you to have the class definition split across multiple files. </P>
<P>Really the big advantage of this is if you're using code generation so that you can generate some code but put your own edits in a separate (untouched by code generation) file. </P>
<P>If you look on the CSLAContrib there's the C# (and VB too, I think) CodeSmith templates that do a good job of this. If you define your CSLA BOs in an XML file you can use the CslaXml template to generate everything - and that allows split classes - you select whether you want to generate the generated or user classes. These templates also have a set of delegates that allow you to hook in to the generated code should you need to at strategic points.</P>
<P>HTH</P>
