<p>Is it possible to use PropertyStatus to set the BackgroundColor of a Control when the Rule(s) of the associated Property is broken?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>PropertyStatus exposes numerous properties like CanRead, IsValid, etc. Most of these are boolean values. You can bind to them, but if you want the resulting value to be a Color you&#39;ll need to implement a value converter to convert the bool to a Color. This is easy, and is something that is very basic to any XAML development - so if you already know what I&#39;m talking about you are good to go. And if you don&#39;t know what a value converter is, you really need to learn - but it is so easy it is like falling off a log, and a quick internet search will give you more detail than you care to read :)X</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
