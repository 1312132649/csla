<P>If it is set to "False"&nbsp; it will walk the child object exposed as properties.&nbsp; This can also cause problems like you describe even if the columns are set in design time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>EDITED changed "True" to "False".&nbsp; You want it to be "True" if you don't want the grid to bind to child collections.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
