<P>In our system we were using a tree view initially to display hierarchical data. To bind a CSLA datasource to a tree view, you'll need to look into IHierarchicalDataSource and accomodate that. </P>

<P>In our case for hierarchical coding, a solution we eventually moved to involved a readonlylistbase of Code instances that had references to their parent in the list (NonSerialized to prevent remoting issues) and you could then fairly easily provide a FullCodeName property which might provide a Area / Category / SubCategory sort of expression that could be bound. </P>
<P>Obviously the sorting of this list is important - when we built the list of codes the algorithm was to end up with a list like this:</P>
<P>Area1</P>
<P>Area1 / Category1</P>
<P>Area1 / Category1 / SubCategory1</P>
<P>Area1 / Category2</P>
<P>Area1 / Category3</P>
<P>Area2 / Category4</P>
<P>etc. </P>
<P>Then, binding was pretty straightforward ... display value was the FullCodeName and the data value was the Id of the code. </P>
<P>Anyways, HTH</P>
