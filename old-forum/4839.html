<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>It isn&#8217;t really &#8220;in transition&#8221;. Writing a 750
page book is no small undertaking, and expecting people to purchase new
editions of such a book 1-2 times a year as the framework changes seems to me
like a poor model.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>This is why I opted to write the ebook sequels &#8211; to provide
documentation and information as the framework changed without the huge
overhead of updating and republishing the big book every 8-12 months.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Additionally there&#8217;s a broader market issue with technology
books. People tend to buy them because the tie into some bigger thing like a
major version of Visual Studio, or to a lesser degree to a major version of
.NET. There hasn&#8217;t been a major release from Microsoft since VS 2005, and
so there was no big product behind which an updated book could &#8216;draft&#8217;
to get momentum. (Which is a really polite way of saying that the 2.1 and 3.0
books, were they 750 page paper books, would never have sold enough copies to
pay for themselves)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So in 2006 I was faced with the option of either making CSLA
commercial, or coming up with some other scheme by which to deliver
documentation and financially support the development of the framework. The
ebook idea was the gamble I took at that time. It isn&#8217;t a perfect
solution, but it is better (I think) than going commercial and restricting the
audience for CSLA, or providing no documentation and probably less development
work over that time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I am working on <i>Expert 2008 Business Objects</i>, but will
likely do more ebook sequels following that book &#8211; for the same reasons
as I did the last two.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>To your last question, Carl has talked to me about doing some
more DNR TV shows, the problem has been one of scheduling. I seriously
overbooked myself over the past 9 months or so &#8211; which was a mistake I hope
never to repeat (but probably will &#8211; you know how it goes&#8230;).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So at some point there might be some overview DNR TV shows, yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Additionally I do hope to put together a series of video
training materials for sale. This may be in conjunction with Dunn Training, or
I may do it directly. There&#8217;s been quite a few requests for this type of
material, and I think it would be a good vehicle to deliver content.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
