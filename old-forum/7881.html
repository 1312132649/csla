My problem is that when deleting multiple rows from the datagrid only one object in the list receives the DataPortal_DeleteSelf call. The program doesn't throw any exception, it just deletes only one object from the list. Before digging into my code to see what might be wrong, I wanted to check first if this should actually work in a DynamicRootList, or if it's something that's not implemented.<br><br>Everything else (inserts, updates) is working ok and, as I mentioned, deletes too, but only one by one. <br><br>Thanks,<br>- Miguel<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mikemir8 replied on Monday, October 26, 2009</h2>After doing some testing, I discovered that the culprit seems to be in the following sequence:<br><br>* The datagridview calls RemoveItem in EditableRootListBase which, among other things calls item.Delete(), which calls MarkDeleted(), which calls MarkDirty(), which calls OnUnknownPropertyChanged(), which call OnPropertyChanged(). <br><br>If I skip the call to OnPropertyChanged(), then I get a second call to RemoveItem (for the following deleted row). But if OnPropertyChanged() is called, then there is no second call to RemoveItem.<br><br>My understanding of the plumbing of databinding is not as good as I wish, so any help trying to figure this out is much appreciated. Is this a bug or is it by design? Any workaround?<br><br>- Miguel<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
