<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using CSLA3.8,and I found BusinessListBase&#39;s collection item are only child objects,but some times,we need root Objects to a list and show in view(DataGridView),In DataGridView we can edit these root objects.so how can i do that?you may suggest me that you should use EditableRootListBase,but in the&nbsp;C# Business Object&nbsp;book,it said EditableRootListBase if&nbsp;for&nbsp; <span class="def"><a>immediately</a>&nbsp;commit the changes?</span></p>
<p><span class="def">Is there any way to use root objects&nbsp;list like BusineesListBase? thank you</span></p>
<p><span class="def"></span></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I follow you. Can you please be a bit clearer as to what you are after?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, May 28, 2013</h2><p>Hi Bruce, </p>
<p>In CSLA you must always have a &quot;root&quot; object that you call Save on to save the changes. <br />So when a BusinessListBase is the &quot;root&quot; all the items in the list is &quot;child&quot; objects that can only be saved in the context of Save the list. </p>
<p>You _can_ use a ReadOnlyList as the &quot;toot&quot; object for a fetch (following th UoW model) and add iuse this list in a grid. However this imp&aring;lies that YOU take reposibility for calling Save and modify code so that you can replace the item in the readonly list. </p>
<p>What is the use-case you want to fulfill?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
