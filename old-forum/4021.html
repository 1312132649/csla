For this, I'm creating my own base class that inherits from BusinessBase where I'm overriding CanReadProperty and CanWriteProperty to work with this new approach. No problem there.<br><br>However, I still don't know what to do with the AuthorizationRules member in BusinessBase. I will not be using this member at all, so my options are:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Name my hashtable AuthorizationRules and hide the old object.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Name my hashtable something like StatusAuthorizationRules and hide the old object.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Name my hashtable something like StatusAuthorizationRules and leave the old object visible.<br><br><br>I'm leaning towards option 1, but I'm not sure if this might have any implications since the type of AuthorizationRules would be changing. I'd like to what others think about this.<br><br>- Miguel</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
