<p>We have encountered a problem with the ReadWriteAuthorization control which I believe is related to how we&#39;ve created our BO.&nbsp; It currently works for all other WinForms except one.</p>
<p>We have created a base class that contains our Property Methods (let&#39;s call it Contact) derived from BusinessBase.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We have created another class called UserContact that inherits the Contact base class.&nbsp; The UserContact class implements the AddAuthorizationRules for each property within the base class (we only set the WriteProperty permission).</p>
<p>We have a WinPart control that contains the ReadWriteAuthorization extender control, an Error Provider control and 3 text boxes (ApplyAuthorization property set to the ReadWriteAuthorization1 extender control).&nbsp; We have the ApplyAuthorizationRules method which invokes the ResetControlAuthorization on the extender control.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I log into the system without the Write/Edit permission the extender control does not disable the 3 text boxes on this one WinPart control.&nbsp; I suspect it has something todo with the base vs. inherited class.</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered a similar problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
