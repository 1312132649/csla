And due to some changes to my server infrastructure a little while ago, I don't actually have a build server at the moment, so that sln hasn't been used for a while...</P>
<P>Did it work in 3.7.0? I haven't touched that sln (intentionally at any rate) for months.</P>
<P>Editorially, it is quite amazing how much time and energy is required to set up and maintain a build server. It is a non-trivial percentage of a person's time on a team. Of course I'm a one-man team, and spending many hours fighting with build server configurations is probably my second least favorite thing to do (right after creating/maintaining install packages).</P>
<P>As you can imagine, since I do this stuff for fun as much as anything, the stuff I hate, hate, hate doing falls to the bottom of my to-do list more often than not :)</P>
<P>All that build server, setup project and so forth only came into being through the work of a volunteer (Nermin). Unfortunately he's moved on to other interests, so there's no one actively interested in working on those aspects of CSLA .NET at the moment.</P>
<P>(you can read that as a plea for someone who <EM>is</EM> interested :) )</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>c_manboy replied on Sunday, September 20, 2009</h2>Rocky,&nbsp; thanks for clarifying that for me.&nbsp; I'm glad to know that I wasn't just "not getting it" and doing something wrong.&nbsp; As for your question, it did not work in 3.7.0, nor in 3.7.1.<br><br>Thanks again!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
