For BindingSource used in master-detail scenario, the CurrentChanged event is raised many times, when the property is changed on child object.</p>
<p>It can be easily reproduced on sample &quot;RootChildGrandchildWinFormTest&quot;. Just add event handlers and breakpoints on all BindingSource.CurrentChanged events and try modify 1st-level child property. Event is raised many times for both child binding source and grandchild binding source (for every property defined on object).</p>
<p>in older versions (4.3.x, 3.8.x) it works fine (event is raised only one-time for GrandChild object)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
