One player will start the game and host a session and the opponent can then connect. I plan on building on top of CSLA .NET, but what is not clear is Win8 WCF/Networking support to achieve Peer to Peer. Does WinRT support something like this? Or, do I need to build against the full .NET API? Any specific considerations regarding CSLA .NET usage in either scenario?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, October 21, 2012</h2><p>I think you will find this hard to do as WinRT applications is client only - and you cannot create a WCF Service to serve data.</p>

<p><i>In Windows Store apps, you can utilize Windows Communication 
Foundation (WCF) client functionality to retrieve data from a WCF 
service, but you cannot create a WCF service to serve data.</i></p>
<p>So I assume you will need to create a .NET backend/intermediary and use dual channel WCF to send/receive messages to/from server. </p>
<p>CSLA is typically only using one.way bindings so you may find that CSLA can be helpful on the client for validation/business rules - but not so much for the server part and dual channel communication.</p>
</div></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RPisarzJr replied on Sunday, October 21, 2012</h2><p>At this point I&#39;m not planning a server component, but rather prefer client to client direct communication if possible. Is it possible to configure CSLA to use a dual channel binding, or is that custom code I&#39;d have to write? What would be the appropriate dual channel binding to use?<br /><br />Thanks for your insight, I appreciate it.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, October 22, 2012</h2><p>CSLA doesn&#39;t include or prevent the use of peer-to-peer concepts. It is neutral on the concept.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you can host a receiver/server on WinRT, but maybe you can - I&#39;ve never tried. If you figure it out, you should blog about it, because this is something I haven&#39;t seen documented anywhere.</p>
<p>If you can host a receiver on WinRT, you should be able to create your own data portal host that delegates into a Csla.Server.DataPortal object, just like the host does for WCF. The &#39;Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration&#39; book talks about creating custom proxy/host types, though not quite for something like you are describing. Still, the basic concepts are the same, as long as you can actually implement a receiver on WinRT.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RPisarzJr replied on Tuesday, October 23, 2012</h2><p>I haven&#39;t seen it documented either (which is why I reached out to the forum), but I will definitely post if I am able to find a solution. I&#39;ll revisit the custom proxy/host types in the Data Portal Configuration book to gain a better understanding. Thanks again for your insight.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been following your work since VB5 and truly appreciate all your efforts.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
