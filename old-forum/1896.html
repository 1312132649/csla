<P>I have a collection of pays which I can load and edit and console program no problems. Any suggestions on how to edit the collection in a web page without saving to the database until all editing is complete. Would a session cache be of use or something else. I need to be able to select a pay, edit it and the return it to the collection, once completed the pays would be save in one set.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
