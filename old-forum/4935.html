In fact I basically copied those rules (so I could also tweak them without editing CSLA itself) and then added more of my own. Now the rules are centralized and I can apply them to many BOs and many properties. In fact, I code gen most of the rules.</P>
<P>For a given BO it may have some rules which are specific to it. In those cases I use the strongly typed rule methods and write the rule in the BO itself. I then have access to all the member variables of the BO.</P>
<P>Finally there is AddDependentProperty which allows you to run the rules for another property if the first property is modified.</P>

That's very helpful~<br><br>one quick little thing<br><br>AddDependentProperty - <br>I am confused with which param is which, can sm1 explain a little?<br><br>and should this be added into the validation rules section?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, June 05, 2008</h2><P>Yes. It is added to the Validation rules section, AddBusinessRules.</P><FONT size=2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is a spelling change in CSLA 3.5 from AddDependantProperty to AddDependentProperty. So use the "wrong" spelling in earlier versions and make the change once you upgrade to 3.5 You will get a compiler warning anyway about the old spelling being deprecated.</P>
