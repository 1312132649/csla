I bought the book Expert C# 2008 Business Objects to read up on the changes since 2.0 and there has been quite a bit!<br><br>So far I am liking the changes, good job Rocky!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 02, 2009</h2>I'm glad you are enjoying them!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sroberts replied on Tuesday, February 03, 2009</h2>Hi Keith,<br><br>I've just (like a week ago) started converting a customer application from v2.1 to v3.6.1, it's amazing how much the framework has matured. <br><br>In revising my codebase, I've been able to remove a lot of databinding 'plumbing' code and concentrate more development time on the actual business functionality of my application.<br><br>I have run into a couple of issues with regard to my usage of the new framework (my lack of understanding in each case) but a couple of posts for help in these forums have solved my issues so far, thanks to Rocky, the team as Magenic and the CSLA community in general.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
