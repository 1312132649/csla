I'm wondering whether the use of the framework would allow for common coding for the business objects between a Web&nbsp;app and a Windows Mobile/CF application or if anyone has experience here? </P>
<P>Essentially I'd like to be able to leverage complex business code only once for development, testing, upgrades, etc. So for example, if I have a sales ordering system that has a complex pricing object can I properly design this in CSLA to be used on both Web and Win Mobile where the Win Mobile app will be offline using SQL Mobile?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Tuesday, September 23, 2008</h2>Exactly what it's for. You should have a look at the PTracker project, which is part of the csla download, it has all of that and more, web services, wpf, ...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Wednesday, September 24, 2008</h2><P>I developed a proof of delivery application for Windows mobile using CSLA although it was based on 1.53.&nbsp; The business objects were very similar to their server counterparts but did have to differ slightly mainly around data access as version of SQL compact I was using only allowed one open connection.&nbsp; Oh and the n-level undo functionality wasn't available as all that serialisation stuff wasn't in the .Net compact either.</P>
<P>It was pretty close though.&nbsp;Still worth doing even if the code does have to differ.&nbsp;</P>
<P>May be better now with later version on .Net compact and windows mobile.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, September 24, 2008</h2><P>I have a large web app using ASP.Net. I recently added a Mobile application to my solution. I used the exact same CSLA Business Objects for it that I use in my ASP.Net app. I treated it the same way as a web app and only had to learn how to code mobile forms and controls. It worked quite nicely.</P>
