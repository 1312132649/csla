I'm starting my first serious web app with CSLA and following ProjectTracker I notice this on most pages ...<br><br>object businessObject = Session["currentObject"];<br>if (businessObject == null || !(businessObject is Project))<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>}<br><br>The following works nicely and takes care of both situations of the session object not existing or is the wrong type. If it exists then you don't need to cast it again from object.<br><br>Project project = Session["currentObject"] as Project<br><br>if (project == null)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>}<br><br>Ross<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RRorije replied on Wednesday, March 14, 2007</h2>Nice, I have seen the 'as' keyword a number of times now in different C# examples. Yet I did not know what it meant and that I should sort that out the next time I would com across it. Which I obviously hadn't done untill now.<br><br>So thanks.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>burmajam replied on Wednesday, March 14, 2007</h2>I do agrea with you.
