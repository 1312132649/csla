I have done this both ways, have a "use case" root object which has a collection of (in your example) cars, each having a child employee list. Other way is to just have a BLB list of cars which on save would start your db transaction and serve as your root object.<br /><br />Otherwise if you edit 1 car at a time it should not be different than the PTracker example of Project/Resources.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>reagan123 replied on Monday, December 07, 2009</h2>Thanks you for the reply.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; <br><br>I always like to try to get some insight from different people in order to see the different ways of solving the same issue.<br><br>I'll also re-look at the PTracker library again.<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
