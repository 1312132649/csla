<P>My understanding of this line line so far:&nbsp; <FONT face="Courier New" color=#0000ff>Inherits BusinessBase(Of Employee)</FONT></P>
<P>1: Business base is a generic type that itself implements IBusinessObject which allows all editable business objects to have a base type of IBusinessObject.&nbsp; This supports polymorphism because&nbsp;I could add to that interface (maybe have Employee, Student, Contact business objects) something like a 'Birthdate' and know that a collection of these various objects would all have that property.</P>
<P>2: (Of Employee) allows the generic type to expose the properties and methods of Employee.</P>
<P>What I don't understand is why a generic is being used here at all.&nbsp; In the previous version of CSLA (1.0) we just inherited BusinessBase which could have an interface as well so I'm not seeing the rationale behind the use of a generic here.&nbsp; I appreciate what a generic can do for a collection - strongly typed collections are a beautiful thing - but I don't understand what the use of a generic is doing for an individual business object over just having it inherit BusinessBase ala' CSLA 1.0</P>

<P>It really helps me work with the material if I know the WHY behind stuff.&nbsp; I figured there was a good reason and now I know it.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, August 09, 2006</h2>No problem.&nbsp; Much of the why is in the book, so if you don't have it, I really recommend it.&nbsp; If you haven't read it and memorized it yet... well I can't say much, I haven't finished it either... yet! <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
