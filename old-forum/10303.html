<p>I have a client/server Silverlight application that uses 3.6.2 and i&#39;m trying to upgrade to a more recent version without going in too much breaking changes (UI and server side).</p>
<p>I understand a lot has been done since that version, so i tried version 3.7.1 but the first thing i noticed (and its a breaking change) was that ValidatedDataGridTextColumn was not available anymore for my datagrids.</p>
<p>I did search the forum site for more than 2 hours and couldn&#39;t find something about this missing function, can someone advise how to proceed? what breaking changes concepts i need to do? I bought the 2008 book but it doesnt include SL.</p>

<p>The ValidatedDataGridTextColumn problem was related 
to a mis-referenced assembly of windows.control.data (not the correct SL
 version, my mistake)</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer, indeed we know we 
are not updated with the 3.8+ CSLA versions that take advantage of the 
SL 3-4 capabilities; I will look to the 3.6 - 4.0 migration 
implications, what areas will need to be changed since we dont use 
ViewModel. Thanks for the video suggestion, will be a must in the near 
future for us.</p>
