<P>It is a bad deal, and may be very disruptive. But at least knowing ahead of time means you can copy your files off before the VPC stops working.</P>
<P>Note that it stops on NOVEMBER 1 - THIS THURSDAY!!!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Cslah replied on Tuesday, October 30, 2007</h2><P>On my msdn subscription it looks like they've reposted the VPC images today (10/30/07), there's new ones there. The description for it says:</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>The Beta 2 VPC images downloaded before October 29, 2007 will expire on November 1, 2007, which is earlier than anticipated. After that time, the VPC will operate for only 1 to 2 hours before needing to be restarted. This restart can be eliminated by upgrading the underlying installation of Windows Server on the original VPC image. Also, these downloads are new VPC images. To transfer Team Foundation Server data to a new VPC, see Moving Team Foundation Server.</EM></STRONG></P>
