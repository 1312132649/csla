<br>
I am trying to use sorting using DataGrid from WPF Toolkit. First, I
tried this approach in creating list (sourceList is ReadOnlyBaseList):<br>
<br>
Transactions = new SortedBindingList&lt;BatchSummary&gt;(sourceList);<br>
<br>
It didn't work. Then I tried Linq:<br>
<br>
Transactions = from summary in sourceList select summary;<br>
<br>
Now sorting works, but I have some questions:<br>
<br>
1. Why SortedBindingList didn't work?<br>
2. What is the right way to do it in 3.6?<br>
3. There is some support for sorting now with indexes. How to use it?<br>
<br>
I really want to archive this utilizing bult-in functionality from DataGrid.<br>
<br>
Thank you.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
