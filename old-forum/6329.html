I'm surprised that reference is there - but it shouldn't matter if you remove it.<br /><br />Second, you do need UnitDriven from CodePlex (or in the Dependencies folder in the CSLA test download). But I don't think any of our stuff is in the namespace you mention.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Preston replied on Thursday, February 05, 2009</h2>I removed the reference without problem.<br>I also had to remove and re-add the UnitDriveNET reference?<br>After that it built.<br><br>Unit tests are all green. : )<br><br>Thanks!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
