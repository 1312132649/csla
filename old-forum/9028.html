<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">General background: We are using CSLA4/ Silverlight4 </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">I watched the MVVM video you posted on your blog. Thanks for that! It was very helpful. However, I am slightly confused now, having listened to it and also perused your &lsquo;CslaMVVMSl&rsquo; project. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">You talk about the &lsquo;Viewfactory&rsquo; and &lsquo;Shell&rsquo; concepts in the video and I am assuming the framework you are using to support that is Bxf . <span style="mso-spacerun:yes;">&nbsp;</span>I looked at how it is being used in the sample project and it seems like the underlying assumption here is that the View:ViewModel relationship is <span style="mso-spacerun:yes;">&nbsp;</span>1:1 type. The &ldquo;ShowView&rdquo; functionality uses the xaml, viewmodel key, viewmodel instance as parameters. So, I am thinking that there can be only 1 viewmodel use in a view. Is this correct or am I way off?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">In our project, there have been numerous instances where a single page/usercontrol has multiple viewmodel instances. Do you think that we&nbsp;need to separate these and decouple them so there is a 1:1 relationship? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Please advice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Thanks</span></p>

<p>I typically have a view bind to one &quot;root&quot; viewmodel. But there may be other viewmodel objects for sub-areas of a view.</p>
<p>How that works depends on the view itself. If the &quot;view&quot; is really a set of different regions that are independent, I&#39;ll usually <i>still</i> have a &quot;viewmodel&quot; or &quot;presenter&quot; to which the view binds, with specific viewmodels for each different region.</p>
<p>But more common is the case where the view binds to a &quot;root&quot; viewmodel, and sub-areas or controls of the view bind to &quot;child&quot; viewmodel objects.</p>
<p>The demo parts of the video series will demonstrate those concepts and implementation.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Chris replied on Monday, June 07, 2010</h2><p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>I posted an issue I am having with the current build of the CslaMVVMSl sample&nbsp;(from SVN) and it is in regards to your comment above:</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably remove the Bxf code from the samples where I&#39;ve been using it, and instead have those samples use releases from the CodePlex site. I think this was a necessary step to avoid having many different versions of the code scattered all over the place.</p>
<p>And of course having this as a CodePlex project means it is relatively easy for other interested people to join into any development effort on Bxf itself.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
