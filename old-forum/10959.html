<p>The rule must be on the parent object but you could </p>
<p>A: create a &quot;message&quot; field and attach the rule to that field rather than the child collection or</p>
<p>B: create an object level rule. </p>
<p>A will allow you to create a &quot;message&quot; field and show the error in a nicer way. Option B will have to be coded by yourself as PropertyStatus does not support object level rules.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
