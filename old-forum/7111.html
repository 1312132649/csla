<P>Example error below.</P>
<P>Error&nbsp;5&nbsp;The type or namespace name 'TestClassAttribute' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)&nbsp;C:\LWSDLSource\CSLA\cslatest\Csla.Test\DataPortal\AsynchDataPortalTest.cs&nbsp;25&nbsp;4&nbsp;Cslacs.Test<BR></P>
<P>Is this a known issue, or am I doing something wrong.</P>
<P>Regards</P>

<P>But in 3.6 and higher we did a bunch of stuff for async tests and Silverlight functionality that may or may not work with MStest at all.</P>
<P>I've seriously thought about switching completely to MStest now that VS Pro includes the test runner. The problem is that it could take many, many days of effort to switch from nunit to MStest at this point, and I just don't have time - especially when nunit is free and works fine.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CraigLittlewood replied on Thursday, June 18, 2009</h2><P>Rocky</P>
<P>Thanks for the prompt answer.&nbsp; I have installed NUnit now (as you probably gathered from the post I made following this one!) and all is working.</P>
<P>Regards</P>
