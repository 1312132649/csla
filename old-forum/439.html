<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hi,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Here's my situation.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>My application has some members who can login, 
register, etc. I'm finding I have a few types of member objects but not sure how 
I should go about doing this.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Firstly, there should be an editable root member 
object, for editing one specific member's information. Let's say a member wants 
to edit their information, or an administrator wants to change some information 
for that member.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Next, there should be a member list of some kind. 
There should be methods that return a list of members, such as, FindAllMembers, 
which retrieves pages of member data. I guess that this could be read only, but 
it's hard to say.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>However, there should be functionality for removing 
members, and adding new members. I'm not sure if this should be done through the 
list or the member object itself?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Assuming and hoping that can be done through the 
top level Member object, I'm thinking of having:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Member (editable root)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>MemberList (Read only list)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>MemberInformation (Read only child)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I'll be making a custom provider that'll be using 
some of the methods from these as well.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Also, there are going to be administrators, 
employees, and customers, as types of members. Should these be separate objects? 
Obviously, employees shouldn't be allowed to edit an administrator's data, but 
an administrator should be able to edit an employee's or customer's information. 
I should also be able to retrieve lists of administrators, employees, and 
customers exclusively.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Most of these hold the same data in common, except 
that customers have address information, which I was thinking could just be 
profile information.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I'm starting to get better at this object oriented 
design, but I'm a little confused on this base.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Thanks,</FONT></DIV>

<P>I would recommend create a Command Object to handle the delete.&nbsp; Then it would work like the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Member list Displayed</LI>
<LI>User selects the delete button/link</LI>
<LI>new MemberDeleteCommand object&nbsp;created using selected member ID, and executed.</LI>
<LI>Refresh List</LI></UL>
<P>Looking at your current design, that is what I would do as well in your situation:</P>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Member (editable root)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>MemberList (Read only list)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>MemberInformation (Read only child)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I wouldn't create new objects based on their security requirements,&nbsp;the new Authorization stuff will help you out a great deal with this, you can set read/write permissions on properties depending on the users roles.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Regards</FONT></DIV>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Why would you create a separate command just for deleting members? Isn't there a Delete method on the business object itself? A bit confused&nbsp; on this point.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks for the reply.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cmellon replied on Thursday, June 22, 2006</h2><P>Hi,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Yes sorry to cause confusion, you could use the Immediate delete option on your Member Class. (didn't think it through before replying :))</P>
