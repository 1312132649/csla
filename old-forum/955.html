<P>I have a MDI application. I load a MDI child form with a read-only collection. I jump to another MDI child form to edit the record which is listed in the first form. When I save and close the record edit form. How do I notify the first from to refresh &amp; get updated data? Some sample code will be appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, August 20, 2006</h2>This has been discussed before - search for "observer pattern" and I think you'll find the thead(s). That is ultimately your answer - is to use an observer pattern or a publish/subscribe scheme (which are closely related to each other) to handle the notification scheme.<br><br>It is not unlike what I did in the book with the Roles and RoleList classes.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CSLAer replied on Monday, August 21, 2006</h2>Yeah, I can find the posts about Observer pattern. It look too complicated. I'm new to C# &amp; CSLA. Is there any simple way (using event &amp; delegate)&nbsp;to do that?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vaxman2 replied on Monday, August 21, 2006</h2><P>The way I handled this was to create an Editable object in the MDI form that had the collection, create the edit form which had a property object for the item to be edited, pass the object to the form, then&nbsp;show the form in&nbsp;a modal mode. When the form was closed, I returned whether the change was applied (OK button) or canceled.</P>
<P>If the change was applied, I would call the editable objects save function and update the collection appropriately..&nbsp;</P>

<p class="MsoNormal">Since you are only notifying one object, an observer would
be overkill<span></span><span>.&nbsp; </span>You really only need a simple
callback in this situation.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can do
this with interfaces, events or delegates.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I typically prefer using
interfaces for callbacks.<span>&nbsp; </span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CSLAer replied on Monday, August 21, 2006</h2>I'm really new to C#. Could you please post few lines of sample codes? thanks</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
