<P>In my system before I perform a Remote Access of a business object.&nbsp; I "Ping" the App Server to make sure it is there.&nbsp; This works for most network work setups but now, on this clients computer, the ping times out.&nbsp; Even if I use START -&gt; RUN -&gt; CMD and type in "Ping www.google.com", that still times out.&nbsp; But I can serf to google.com via IE no problem.</P>
<P>My question is this.&nbsp; What would happen if I remove the "Ping" check in my application and just try to remote the BO?&nbsp; If I can not ping the address will I still be able to remote the BO since I am using IIS and HTTP protocal?</P>
<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated,</P>
