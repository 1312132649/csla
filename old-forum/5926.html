I have chosen
NHibernate for their maturity, complemented by the simplicity of
ActiveRecord.<br><br>Investigating, I found some interesting projects like: <br><br> ProjectTrackerNHibernate in <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CSLAcontrib">http://www.codeplex.com/CSLAcontrib</a><br>CslapTrackerFactory in <a href="http://cslaptrackerfactory.googlecode.com/">http://cslaptrackerfactory.googlecode.com/</a><br><br>Both are based on NHibernate, but the deal differently. I would like to hear their views on these two projects or others, to take as a base project, or know what do you recommend for my needs.<br><br>In general, I want to find documents, websites, blogs, projects, source
code, samples, guidlines and so on. Related NHibernate + ActiveRecord, or at least
one of the two. All this of course, that can be applied to CSLA.NET.<br><br><div id="result_box">Thanks in advance<br><br>Jorge<br><br></div></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Wednesday, December 03, 2008</h2><P>I think this approach has promise. I started with a sample NHibernate layer for CSLA in which a common base class was inserted below each of the CSLA main entity classes (e.g. BusinessBase&lt;T&gt;, BusinessListBase&lt;T&gt;...).</P>
<P>In my case, I decided to use a different ORM (Wilson ORMapper), mainly because NHibernate doesn't allow native SQL to be used and generated parameters in a fashion that would cause server optimization problems (e.g. different parameter names on each object invocation, causing queries to not be found in the cache).</P>
<P>Still, I found it a straightforward process and have CSLA cooperating very nicely with the ORM. I can try to dig up the original source code for the layer classes if you are interested. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jgamba replied on Wednesday, December 03, 2008</h2>Of course, I am very interested, please post your source code<br><br>Jorge<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Wednesday, December 03, 2008</h2><P>It turns out I started with the Csla.NHibernate classes in the project tracker sample:</P>

<P>They were pretty easy to translate to use a different ORM (other than a minor factory issue -- NHibernate lets you populate an object created by someone else and my ORM doesn't).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
