<P>Version 2.1.2 includes some bug fixes and minor enhancements. The enhancements are primarily around the CslaDataSource web control, which now provides more integrated support for paging and sorting.</P>
<P>Most importantly, version 2.1.2 is the specific version described in my <EM>CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</EM>. I am releasing this as a ~160 page&nbsp;ebook, available in editions for both C# and VB, for purchase directly from my web site. </P>
<P><FONT size=4>The VB <EM>CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</EM> is available NOW at </FONT><A href="http://store.lhotka.net/"><FONT size=4>http://store.lhotka.net</FONT></A><FONT size=4>.</FONT> </P>
<P>Look for the C# edition in the very near future (it is in the final review stage).</P>
<P>This&nbsp;new book is best though of as a sequel to my my Expert C# 2005 Business Objects and Expert VB 2005 Business Objects books. It covers the changes made since CSLA .NET 2.0 was released: how the framework has changed, and how to use the new features and capabilities. Please note that this <EM>is not a replacement</EM> for those books: it expands on them.</P>
<P>Releasing this as an ebook in PDF format is a risk on my part. I put just as much time and effort into writing this book as I have any other book I've written, but I want to provide a more cost-effective way for you to purchase this material than through normal publishing channels. It is my sincere hope that you will purchase this book if you read it&nbsp;(even after a few people have purchased it and they start sharing it for free).</P>
<P>I'm not giving up on traditional publishing channels necessarily. I'll most likely use a traditional publishing approach when I reach a point that CSLA .NET and/or my thinking changes to such a degree that there'd be value for you, as a reader, in me rewriting my books in a major way. But when I'm writing about extra functionality that rests on the existing work, it seems like I'm providing better value to you by selling a lower-cost sequel than forcing you to repurchase much of the same material to get at the new parts.</P>
<P>But all this hinges on people's honesty. On your honesty.</P>
<P>I hope you enjoy CSLA .NET 2.1.2, and the new book. Thank you, code well, have fun!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, January 26, 2007</h2>Very cool, I'm downloading it now.<br><br>I'll be patientely awaiting the C# version of the e-book.<br><br>I'm curious, is there a reason you chose not to protect the e-book somehow?&nbsp; I don't intend on sharing mine, I'm just curious.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ChrisD replied on Friday, January 26, 2007</h2><P>Cool - It's finally available :)</P>

<P>The primary reason is that DRM leads to frustrated users. If I assigned a unique password to each PDF, and you lost your password, you'd be frustrated. And I'd have to come up with a support mechanism to get you a new PDF or password recovery or something.</P>
<P>The other reason is that DRM doesn't actually work. It keeps the honest people honest, but pirates defeat DRM. You can find other DRMed PDF docs out there, passed around in a zip file with a readme.txt that contains the password...</P>
<P>So I didn't see any good reason to irritate honest people with a technology that does little to prevent theft by pirates.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Friday, January 26, 2007</h2><P>I just bought my copy.</P>

the stuff in the eBook;&nbsp; however i must say that i am somewhat
disappointed.&nbsp; The eBook is largely a discertation on the recent
enhancements, and hardly comprises the sort of comprehensive
framework&nbsp; reference and guidelines needed for 2.1 to support and
sell the practical side of the framework to associates (especially
those who have not grown up with the&nbsp; progression). The "Book"
itself is out of date and the build-up to the "eBook" publication
indicated (at least to me) that this would be the way of the next
edition (or at least an abridged edition) of the "Book" itself.<br>
<br>
<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 29, 2007</h2><P>Jimbo,</P>
<P>I'm sorry you are disappointed in the ebook. I think I've been quite clear all along that I intended this to be a sequel, or continuation, of the original book. I don't think I've ever said that I intended to rewrite the original or merge all the content. I could not do that using the ebook approach in any case, as Apress owns the publishing rights to the original book.</P>
<P>Over the past few months,&nbsp;a number of people did ask if I wouldn't just update the whole book to incorporate the 2.1 changes completely. I have repeatedly indicated that I would <EM>not</EM> do that at this time. I don't feel that it is in the best interest of the community (though perhaps I'm wrong) to make everyone buy another US$60 book to get some changed content, but mostly unchanged content.&nbsp;It seems more cost-effective to spend less money and only buy what's new.</P>
<P>I face the same dilema with CSLA .NET 3.0 btw. The use of WCF, WPF and WF is entirely additive. Just like .NET 3.0 is to .NET 2.0. While I'll effectively end up with at least two chapters for WCF, one for WPF and one for WF, the impact on the existing book is small. So I'd end up expanding the current book from 600 pages to, perhaps 750. You'd end up spending US$70 (or something) to buy the new content plus re-purchase the 600 pages you already have.</P>
<P>Then there's .NET 3.5, and presumably CSLA .NET 3.5. I think that may have a larger impact on CSLA itself, due to the language enhancements in C# and VB (not so much due to ADO.NET EF or LINQ themselves).</P>
<P>The thing is, both CSLA .NET and Microsoft's platform are changing so fast that it is hard to keep up. Given the current rate of change, you'd end up buying 1-2 US$60 books every year. One for pure CSLA changes, and another for .NET 2.0/3.0/3.5/etc.</P>
<P>Obviously I can't write that fast. It takes months to research/write/edit/publish a book. And it takes months to recoup the cost of that time/effort. Book sales don't happen all at once, and people won't buy a .NET 2.0 book when .NET 3.0 is nearly out, etc. If I go into some insane cycle of trying to put out 1-2 new book editions each year, the books never have enough shelf time to generate enough sales to warrant the effort to write them. As it is, due to Microsoft's release schedules, shelf times are barely enough to warrant the effort...</P>
<P>So my alternatives are to do what I'm doing with this ebook experiment, which allows additive content with slighly less lead-time (since I skip the months of publisher/distribution time - using a traditional publisher the ebook would be out in about 6-8 weeks from now due to this).</P>
<P>Or I can return to what I did with CSLA 1.x, which was to do lots of enhancements to the framework and to <EM>not document them</EM> in any formal way until the next major release when I can update the book. Those major releases, and associated book, would be every 2-3 years. In between, everyone would have to infer what was in version 3.1.3 (or whatever), and/or rely on the forum to figure it out.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mikeclimbs replied on Monday, January 29, 2007</h2><P>Just bought the book can't wait to read it.</P>
<P>Rocky it maybe worth selling the ebook on amazon.&nbsp; People looking for the print book may find your ebook.</P>
<P>I've never sold anything on the site, but when ever I search for something non amazon vendors all popup</P>

<P>I may try selling the book through other channels, but I wanted to try the simple, direct, approach first and see whether that's practical. There are self-publishing and/or vanity publishing services out there that will get a book listed as a "real" book and make it available through various real-world channels. I think Amazon itself has something along this line even.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jimbo replied on Monday, January 29, 2007</h2>eBooks are great, but personally i prefer the real thing as i can
pencil in notes etc. Unfortunately the implementation detail of the
subject we are dealing with ages very quickly;&nbsp; ( Net 3, Vista -
doh!); however the underlying principles ( as in your treatise)&nbsp;
will better wear the test of time.&nbsp; Electronic publication has the
better means to keep up with the changes. I had no hesitation in
downloading the 2.1 eBook supplement and at a cost ( in Aussie dollars)
almost as much as the original book. But as I have said, it does not
provide the comprehensive updated reference&nbsp; that I was seeking.<br>

I clicked on edit billing address it didn't let me, but when I selected
continue, there it was on a PayPal page. And when I was done, it didn't
say anything about a download, I too thought I would get a download
email link later. But luckily, I chose the option to return to merchant
as I wanted to check things again, but instead of getting back to
merchant I was placed on a page that offerred me the oppotunity to
download the book. Not a complaint, just hope this will be helpful to
others.<br>
<br>
Rocky THANKS for the update. I for one, having read the last two books
did not want to have to wade through another one full of information I
already knew, just to figure out how to use the updates. Look forward
to reading it. I've a collection of framework books, but your's is the
one I chose to actually implement, and have no regrets. Please keep up
the good work.<br>
