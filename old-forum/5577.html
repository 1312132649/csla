application to an offshore company. Probably OK coders in the end, but lousy
project management and communication forced me to pull the project 6 months in.
I've had a trusted developer take it over, who has for the most part completely
rewritten the app from the ground up. <br>
<br>
App is written in C#, ASP.NET, SQL2005. A lot of gridded data, and we are using
custom controls from Infragistics. Current development resource&nbsp; has employed CSLA in the app, and it would be good to find someone of like mind.<br>
<br>
Pretty typical story. Good news is that we are in pretty good shape overall
(the product works, and is ready to be released commercially); however, our
developer is moonlighting and is not able to devote enough time to make real
progress on the project. <br>
<br>
I need to transition the application to someone who we can work with longer
term. We have the source code (we have an instance of source safe at our
office). <br>
<br>
Our initial needs are minor. although there's a bunch of knowledge transfer
that needs to go on. My biggest interested is in developing a long term
relationship with someone who can help us grow and expand the application.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dlabar replied on Wednesday, October 15, 2008</h2>Would this be a full time, part time, or remote position?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kennyschiff replied on Wednesday, October 15, 2008</h2>Remote, freelance and very part-time.<br><br>I may have this filled; however, I wouldn't mind keeping you in queue, so do let me know about yourself and capabilities.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
