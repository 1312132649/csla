<P>Thanks!</P>

<P>The short answer is that you shouldn't return a business object from a service. Instead, you should create a contract-based DTO (data transfer object) that you return from the service. The code for the service then is typically pretty simple: retrieve the business object, copy its data into the DTO and return the DTO.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ataylorm replied on Thursday, November 29, 2007</h2>Thank you, we haven't managed to get that deep into the book yet. :)<BR><BR>
