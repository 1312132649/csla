<p>I&#39;m trying to fetch some data from a BusinessBase&lt;T&gt; class.</p>
<p>I can override DataPortal_Create(), DataPortal_Update()... but I see no DataPortal_Fetch</p>
<p>Sure, I can type it in, but why is DataPortal_Update virtual and DataPortal_Fetch</p>
<p>not virtual?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, May 03, 2011</h2><p>Create commonly has no parameters in most cases, so a base is provided which you can override.&nbsp; The same goes for update and insert; they never take parameters as the object should contain all the state it needs.&nbsp; Fetch on the other had usually will require at least one parameter to fetch the correct object, and there&#39;s so many possible ways to specify which one to fetch, the framework leaves out a base to override.</p>
<p>It was there at one point, but as you may have guessed, no one ever ever overrode it, and thus it was removed.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
