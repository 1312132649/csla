It's free and it uses the free version of CodeSmith for the templates it uses (that you can modify) to do your code and sprocs.

Do yourself a favor and check out:

Current support for CSLA is up to 3.5, though.  

It has largely been the love child of one fantastic developer, and Andres Villanueva.  But of late a couple of others have joined in.  Adres' work supports VB and and the helpers are working on the C# stuff for 3.5 that was recently finished on the VB side.  

The user interface for this is really an improvement over building templates with a product like CodeSmith or MyGeneration (my favorite from CSLA 1.5.3 days).  You are MUCH more efficient with his front end.  

For more info, I close with the closing he uses on all his announcements:

Have fun with it!
