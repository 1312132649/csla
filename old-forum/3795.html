<H3>Want I want</H3>
<P>What I want is a behaviour like in apache`s auth:</P><CODE>Deny from all<BR>Allow from host1 host2 host3 </CODE>
<P>In code it may be like that:</P><CODE>DenyRead("*", "SomeRole");<BR>AllowRead("Property1", "SomeRole");<BR>AllowRead("Property2", "SomeRole");<BR></CODE>
<P>This will deny ALL properties for this role and then allow only two for example.</P>
<H3>Why I want like that?</H3>
<P>When I have some BO with about 20-30 properties and this object may be frequently change in future, but "SomeRole" must always see only two of them.</P>
<P>If there is another way of solving such proplem, pls, redirect me there.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, October 29, 2007</h2>Well using AllowRead / DenyRead you'll have to put in a line for each property.&nbsp; Can any roles read the other properties?&nbsp; If so, AllowRead will only allow reading from that role, all others will be denied implicitly.&nbsp; <br><br>So AllowRead( "Property3", "SomeOtherRole" ) will implicitly deny any other role.<br><br>If you're not, you may want to just override CanReadProperty, check for SomeRole, and if user is a member of SomeRole, check if its one of those two properties and hand the call off to the base.&nbsp; Otherwise, return false.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
