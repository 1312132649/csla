My CSLA validation image shows correctly, however, if I hover over to see the validation message .. the CSLA message gets cut off because of where my control is position.  Should the CSLA validation message popup on top of the IE Window?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Seth Mims</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 09, 2009</h2><P>I'm guessing that Silverlight content can't extend outside the browser client area for security reasons.</P>
<P>It may be the case that PropertyStatus should detect that the popup window is too near an edge, and adjust its origin artificially to the left. I didn't write this control, so I don't know if that's easy/hard/possible.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
