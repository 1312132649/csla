<P>For example, lets say I have the following business object candidates:</P>
<P>RequestPackage - this object represents a request batch that is created by a user, fulfilled and managed as a aggregate work package.&nbsp; Sample properties would include:</P>
<P>RequestPackageID<BR>UserID<BR>RequestPackageName<BR>Requests<BR>etc.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Each RequestPackage consists of one or more Requests.&nbsp; A Request is a single fulfillment request (like a line item on an order).&nbsp; My question is: what is the appropriate class structure to implement the Requests collection property in the RequestPackage class?&nbsp; Is something like this correct:</P>
<P>1.&nbsp; Implement RequestPackage as an editable root<BR>2.&nbsp; Implement RequestPackage.Requests as an editable child collection of Request<BR>2.&nbsp; Implement Request as an editable child</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>thanks,</P>

Just remember to model your objects around the use case (more or less around the UI) and not around the database structure and you'll have better results.</P>
<P>Make sure to read at least the first 5 chapters of the <EM>Expert 2008 Business Objects</EM> book, as they'll answer a lot of this type of question.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
