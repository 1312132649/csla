We are looking into having some of our customers run the winforms gui on their machines and connect to our server for the data. This gives us many benefits; they don't have to purchase a server machine, we perform backups,&nbsp; etc. <br><br>We've been adjusting our exe's with threading and the response times are great using remoting. (This is turn has helped our non remoting users experience a much more responsive UI as well). We've been using http and https for testing and all looks well. <br><br>Before we put more customers on remoting I'm wondering what the best connectivity options are. Should we stay http and force them to use a VPN? (We'd be forced to drop some hardware on their network). Should we use https? How many users can run off one machine in that mode? (I know that is a broad question) Should we look at SSL/compression hardware to take the load off the server? Should we start with the sql server on one machine and iis on the another?<br><br>Is anyone else doing this and what issues have you run into?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>eslater replied on Sunday, October 15, 2006</h2>I have been running two apps in a remoting environment for quite some time.&nbsp; Neither app is particularly heavily used so I cant comment too much about load.&nbsp; We have been running both apps on boxes that contain both sql and iis without any problem.&nbsp; Eventually we will be moving sql onto its own box but until usage dictates it the app runs faster with both on the same box.<br><br>I found using VPN slower.&nbsp; I also found it slower when connecting directly to SQL over the internet.&nbsp; The best overall performance was running the app through iis using remoting.<br><br>I have not used https so I cant help much there.<br><br>Elliot<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Skeeboe replied on Sunday, October 15, 2006</h2>I'll have to use some type of encryption SSL(Https) or VPN because of the data. I'm testing with http but I've changed all&nbsp; personal info to fake data. I'm pleased with the response rates but there is no load yet...<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
