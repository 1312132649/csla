<P>The array is of IPropertyInfo objects - and there's no IPropertyInfo for IsNew... But you can add one to your class - it shouldn't cause any issue since it is just metadata - and then you'd be able to have the rules subsystem provide the IsNew value to your rule method.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>opedog replied on Monday, December 14, 2009</h2>I am kicking myself for not thinking of that...&nbsp; Thanks, Rocky!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
