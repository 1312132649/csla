<P>Version 3.7.0 is essentially 3.6.3 tweaked to compile under Silverlight 3. For Windows users you can think of 3.7.0 as 3.6.4.</P>
<P>That's all good.</P>
<P>I started adding more complete support for Silverlight 3 into 3.7.1, but that will require some breaking changes. And to maintain parity, there'll be some comparable breaking changes for WPF support as well. So far all the breaking changes are purely at the UI level (Csla.Wpf and Csla.Silverlight) and I plan to keep it that way.</P>
<P>However, there are a couple bugs in 3.7.0 that I want to fix, and I want to do it without forcing people to accept breaking changes to get them.</P>
<P>So I'm rearranging the versioning a bit.</P>
<P>In the new model (and this affects svn today):</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Version 3.7.x </STRONG>is being developed out of a branch. Version 3.7.1 will be minor bug fixes from 3.7.0, nothing more. I'll do a beta drop of this very soon (probably yet this week).</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Version 3.8.0 </STRONG>is being developed out of trunk. Version 3.8.0 will include the enhancements for Silverlight 3 support, including the breaking changes. I'll start doing pre-release drops of this maybe this week or next, and I'll need your help determining if my changes are on track or not - so <STRONG>if you are a Silverlight or WPF developer</STRONG> PLEASE help me (and yourself) out by looking at the 3.8 code as it comes out.</LI></UL>
