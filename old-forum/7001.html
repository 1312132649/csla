This can be configured to run locally if not database access is required, and may not even be needed if you just want to use standard constructors as part of your factory methods.<br /><br />  - DataPortal_Insert is used to store the object if it is new and the Save() method is called, this generally involves putting the a new record into the database / storage mechanism that you use.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
