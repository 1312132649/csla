The reason behind this is the Stored procs are pretty simple and return data for an object or a collection of objects. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Any suggestions? or Any one encountered the same problem?</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
<P>Ash</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>William replied on Sunday, February 11, 2007</h2><DIV>Since the stored procedures are written to return object and collection data. I don't quite understand why root/child objects could not be created. Perhaps, you can try to elaborate more.</DIV>

<P>I can probably understand why are the Stored procs like that, because if we follow the root and child objects model as we have in CSLA, then I will have one root object and 7 child obects, 4 child collection objects and 3 grand child collection objects, so apparently loading all these objects won't be a good idea?? (right? wrong?) considering its a web app.</P>
<P>Now coming to the question why I can't create root/child objects? It was not quite intuitive to me either :) :) because then all the stored procs (for the objects as I explained above) will be called by the root object, right ?</P>
<P>thanks</P>

<P>The simplest way to handle this is to only have root editable objects and simply ignore child objects altogether.&nbsp; Or put root collections inside of root objects.&nbsp; The down side is that you lose transaction support meaning that a bug/crash could leave your parent and child objects in inconsistent states.&nbsp; I would strongly recommend writing&nbsp;additional stored procedures (at least for the fetch/update procs).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ashraf Ali replied on Sunday, February 11, 2007</h2><P>JonM,</P>
<P>Thanks for your help, Do you suggest</P>
<P>1) rewriting some of the stored procs like we have example Stored procs in ProjectTracker?</P>
<P>2) or using Trasactions (COM+) in VB.NET code (as supported by CSLA)</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

This is specially true in a web environment, where you usually want to avoid cluttered web pages, so you probably won't display a root with all it's 3 child collections and each of it's children child collections. This is also specially true if you are using session to store the objects, because you'll have a much bigger footprint in your session for no particular reason.<br><br>So, the questions you should ask yourself are "What is really my use case? how will these objects be used? For what purpose(es)?"<br><br>Perhaps it is the case that you need some of those items as child collections, and some as standalone collections. Perhaps you realize that you don't really need them as child collections.<br><br>It is true in most cases that you don't need to load such a deep hierarchy as you mention. It's just that the way the data is structured leads you to thinking that way.<br><br>Perhaps you could design your structure as you mentioned, but only load children on demand (Lazy Loading).<br><br><br>Anyway, there are different ways of doing the same thing, you just need to figure out what's best for you.<br><br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ashraf Ali replied on Monday, February 12, 2007</h2>ajj,<br>
consider a simple scenareio in my app, <br>
One of stored proc returns data for the client, which is a root object,&nbsp; what I do is, store that clientid in session.<br>
<br>
Other stored procs returns result sets for orders and&nbsp; Income info
about client which are child collections of the root object, each of
these stored procs requires clientid, so I pass them the clientid which
I had already stored in session.<br>
This is a very simple example, just to illustrate the point<br>
Thanks<br>

<P>There is no reason why CSLA child collections and child objects cannot handle their own persistence without any modification to the CSLA base classes.&nbsp; The implementation in Rocky's book is just a sample and can be modified to meet your needs.&nbsp; I have done similar in past and it can work with no problems.</P>
<P>There is also no reason why this can't happen all in the same transaction, particularly with .Net 2.0 transaction support.&nbsp; Just make sure your are not opening needless connections to the same database.&nbsp; Prior to .Net 2.0 you would have to manually pass the transaction around to all the child objects.</P>
<P>You should be cognizant of the fact that you will take a performance hit for making more calls to the database.&nbsp; One call that passes a large amount of data will perform better than many calls that each produce a subset.&nbsp; However if your object hierarchies and transaction volume&nbsp;are reasonably sized you should be able to get away with it without the user noticing.</P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I'm glad that my suggestion was helpful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I think&nbsp;a bit of qualification is required due to the amount of responses you have received.<BR>I work with Windows Clients exclusivley, so if your application is web-based there may be some better suggestions or additions that are more in line with what you are trying to do.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>It would be good if you could document the procedures that you are using for the root and child object, then we all could see what you are up against.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>xal&nbsp;had a great idea - make sure you establish what data you need before grabbing everything from your db. There is no need to grab a root object and 500 child objects if the user is only going to pick one child object from&nbsp;the list of 500. Lazy loading is definately a consideration in this situation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Remember to think of your user when building your apps - there the ones who have to use it. One thing I do my best to avoid is having the user wait ages for the data to be retrieved from the db (that pisses me right off, and I've seen heaps of professional in-house programs that load <EM>thousands</EM> of objects into a treeview - after about 30 seconds or more I get to see the treeview).</FONT></P>
