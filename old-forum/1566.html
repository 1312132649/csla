I remember a few months back when .net 2.0 was still in beta there was someone on Kathleen's forums who had a link to these. Since then her website has undergone some redesign and her forums are currently down (for a few weeks now).</P>
<P>Has anyone here created these templates with the current version of CSLA?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>&lt;Edit&gt;I am looking specificaly for C# templates but I can easily convert from VB.NET if available.&lt;/Edit&gt;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>wjcomeaux replied on Tuesday, October 24, 2006</h2>Guess not. I ordered the 2005 version of the book last night and should get it today. I'll see if I can concoct the templates myself. I'll post my results for scrutiny and use when I get somewhere with them. Shouldn't take more than a couple of days.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bayu replied on Tuesday, October 24, 2006</h2>Hello,<br><br>I closely monitored your thread hoping someone would help you out. I am in the middle of reading Kathleens book and like you I intend to bring her ideas to life for CSLA 2.x. At the same time you started this thread I asked Q Johnson for some information, since he mentioned some custom templates earlier on this forum, but he has not replied yet. <br><br>I guess there is much to gain by writing these templates yourself. I guess the experience is much needed when it comes to debugging/maintaining them. <br><br>I would be very interested in getting Kathleen's harness to work for CSLA 2.0 and intended to implement it myself sooner or later. Maybe we can stay in close contact and perhaps even work on it together when this might come in handy and share some of the effort? I am not sure if this really is a multi-person project, but at least I would be more than willing to help you out with any tough detail that comes up. I have a fair amount of XML/XSLT experience which might be of benefit.<br><br>Let me know what you think?<br><br>Bayu<br><br>
<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>wjcomeaux replied on Tuesday, October 24, 2006</h2><P>As for the harness itself, it's easy to port into the 2.0 environment. I've got it working quite nicely. It is just the templates for the new framework. I have have my 2.0 version of the generator work on any templete. The problem is getting a template that generated 2.0 code. I am certain that there are templates for this out there as I had looked at them at one time. They incorporated generics and such in the CSLA framework. I'd be surprised if the project was just dumped. The problem is, there is no way to search through Kathleen's forums (or even view them) to find out who was working on it. It's been months since I last worked with this and new we are ready to push forward with CSLA 2.0 and the code generator.</P>
<P>I don't imagine it will be that difficult to come up with templates for the new framework, but I'll need the book for reference. It should arrive today. I'll post my templates as I work on them. I'm actually working on them right now.</P>

The templates are for CSLA 1.4 and according to the accompanying notes they contain several (yet documented) bugs.<br><br>There seem to be some improvements in the templates for the stored procs, which may be of interest.

<P>Send them to both <A href="mailto:will_comeaux@stuller.com">will_comeaux@stuller.com</A> and <A href="mailto:websitewill@cox.net">websitewill@cox.net</A> as I am not sure where I will be the next time I work on this (probably at work on Monday morning).</P>
<P>How much different is 1.4 from the 2.x verison?</P>
<P>I've got my port nearly complete (first run) and will make them available sometime next week if anyone here wants a look. I am still working out a few things in the generator. Things like Kathleen somewhere has a SmartDate replacement that is using "CSLA" which works fine in VB but C# requires it to be "Csla". Once I find that change I should have compilable code being generated.</P>
<P>After that I plan to step back and examine the bigger picture as well as see about making sure I have all changes applied to the templates as I am currently generating them straight from the book but I'm sure there have been improvements to the framework since the book was published.</P>
<P>Cheers,</P>
