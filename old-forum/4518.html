This place has served as a fantastic resource for me as I've been getting started with Rocky's awesome framework.</P>
<P>Background:<BR>I've been messing with the framework for a little while now and I'm still having a really hard time wrapping my head around this situation. In my object model I have a "Job" Editable BO. It's responsible for persisting a valid Job. This object is rather large and getting hard to deal with (# of properties are high).&nbsp;Job can logically be composed of some sub objects (i.e. a <SPAN class=goog-spellcheck-word>jobLocation</SPAN> object - responsible for saving a&nbsp; valid job location). These objects would not have their own identity's and would have a 1:1 relationship with the root job <SPAN class=goog-spellcheck-word>bo</SPAN>. Currently, the root is responsible for validating and saving these "would be" sub objects.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Question:<BR>Should I make these logical groupings Editable Children and implement validation, authorization, data access in them? Or should I make these groupings value objects and do all the business logic in the parent job class? Or should I just leave them "as is" in the root and find some other way to deal with the size?</P>
<P>The editable children approach seems best to me from a design perspective, but from an implementation perspective I worry it might be more difficult in the area's of <SPAN class=goog-spellcheck-word>databinding</SPAN> and data access. I haven't really seen any examples where children are 1:1 with their roots. Any advice from the trenches would be greatly appreciated.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pillesoft replied on Wednesday, March 19, 2008</h2>i have some similar problem ...<br>please check post http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/22100.aspx<br>in my case there is also 1:1 relation<br>but unfortunately still no time to check the examples in detail, so i will watch your answers too, and if you find sg usefull let me kno. i'll do the same.<br><br>Ivan<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, March 19, 2008</h2>One option would be to have child objects which are used behind the scenes.&nbsp; The root becomes a facade object, but you can split your implementation to different classes.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dmo145 replied on Wednesday, March 19, 2008</h2><P>pillesoft,</P>
<P>I'll let you know what I&nbsp;end up doing.&nbsp;</P>
<P>ajj3085,</P>
<P>Ah, I see. Thats not a bad option. Though I was trying to avoid having a root with a flattened hierarchy (I hate having properties like prefixes like&nbsp;LocationState, LocationCity, etc) that option would definitely help simplify management of my auth and val rules.</P>
<P>What about data access? Good db design results in me having 1 table for all these objects. But I think I would like each object to be responsible for its own data. When distributing this responsibility it always results in&nbsp;many&nbsp;hits to the&nbsp;same table. While its probably a tradeoff for the logical simplicity, I could just be using a poor design. Anyways, any suggestions on how to handle the da? Should I build/save these objects in the root, or, from you're experience, would I be better off distributing this intelligence so that each child can save load itself?</P>
<P>Again thanks for the help, any other suggestions are great!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
