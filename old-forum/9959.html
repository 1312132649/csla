<p>Are there any updated examples for newer versions of CSLA?&nbsp; I&#39;m using 4.0.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Ryan</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 19, 2011</h2><p>There&#39;s a difference between the way you write the DataPortal_XYZ methods in .NET and SL.</p>
<p>In .NET the DataPortal_XYZ create/fetch/delete methods take whatever parameter type you want to pass - as long as the type is serializable. The insert/update/deleteself methods don&#39;t accept any parameters and are virtual. The create method is also virtual, but only if you use the default implementation with no parameters.</p>
<p>In SL the DataPortal_XYZ methods all require a callback parameter, because the assumption is that most of these methods will be invoking remote services. Those invocations must be asynchronous, therefore the DataPortal_XYZ methods must be asynchronous, therefore they must accept a callback.</p>
<p>In SL the DataPortal_XYZ create/fetch/delete methods take whatever additional parameter type you want to pass - as long as the type is serializable. The insert/update/deleteself methods don&#39;t accept additional parameters and are virtual. The create method is also virtual, but only if you use the default implementation with only the callback parameter.</p>
<p>This is all covered in a lot of detail in the upcoming <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Access</em> ebook, part of the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;ProductID=22">Using CSLA 4 ebook series</a>.</p>
<p>All the samples in the CSLA 4 version 4.1 Samples download should be current and should work, so please check them out.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ryan M replied on Wednesday, January 19, 2011</h2><p>OK, thanks.&nbsp; That makes sense.&nbsp; I want to use the same model in WPF and SL applications, so I had added the class files as links in visual studio.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#39;ll request that we get the ebooks.&nbsp; In the mean time I&#39;m assuming the best way to use essentially the same model for&nbsp;both environments&nbsp;is to create the data access on the non-SL side and access those methods asynchronously via the equivalent SL methods.&nbsp; Or is there a better way?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ryan</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ryan M replied on Wednesday, January 19, 2011</h2><p>...or just always put the model in a silverlight project...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 19, 2011</h2><p>I generally use file links and compiler directives. The code in the <em>Creating Business Objects</em> and <em>Data Access</em> ebooks shows how to use compiler directives as appropriate.</p>
<p>Also the \Net\cs\SimpleNTier sample app demonstrates how to make a business model that is shared between .NET, SL and WP7.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
