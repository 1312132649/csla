<P>So my question is, "Is it in-appropriate to post code on the forums for a given solution?"</P>
<P>In this case, a title of "How to mix AD and custom authentication".</P>
<P>Followed by a description of my solution.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 15, 2006</h2>As long as the code doesn't break violate copyright or licenses that's great. Given the nature of this problem, I assume you created your own custom principal? You can post that, no problem - probably as an attachment would work best, but use your own judgement.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeHaynes replied on Friday, September 15, 2006</h2><P>Thanks very much.</P>
<P>I appologize for my ignorance, but how do you add an attachment to a post?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Friday, September 15, 2006</h2>It is on the Options tab when you post your message.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeHaynes replied on Friday, September 15, 2006</h2><P>Thanks again.&nbsp; I looked before but didn't see it.</P>
