<P>1. CSLA Framework</P>
<P>2. Business Layer</P>
<P>3. BusinessService Interface</P>
<P>#2 references #1 and # 3 references # 2. But i cant compile this as I need to reference both 1 and 2 in 3 since 2 depends on 1. Though things will compile but is this the right thing to do? means letting yr service interface know about the BL framework too?</P>
<P>Also, one more thing: if i use a web service UI instead of service interface, i dont need to reference the framework as Web compilation model works different than class libraries and it copies and references #1 automatically.</P>
<P>And there is a post which says this is a bug in C# compiler:<BR><A href="http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/56/284237.aspx">http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/56/284237.aspx</A></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 26, 2006</h2><P>I don't see the problem. If your 3 was any type of UI, you'd just have it reference 1 and 2. Of course 2 references 1 as well.</P>
<P>The only reason 3 needs to reference 1 is because the JIT compiler needs you to do that in order to successfully load types from 2. It is the way the .NET type loader and JIT compiler work.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
