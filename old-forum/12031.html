<p>I have recently re-read the excellent ebook
&laquo;&nbsp;using Csla4-04-Dataportal&nbsp;&raquo; focusing on Windows Authentication.
Actually, I&#39;m trying to implement a 3 tiers wpf application authentication
relying on Active Directory identity.</p>
<p>In my case, the user and client workstation are
not on the AD domain, so I&#39;m looking for a way where the user can specify a
windows account AD (by example typing: domain,&nbsp;username and password)
which will be next checked on the server part.</p>
<p>In the samples provide with the ebooks, the
&quot;windows authentication solution&quot; seems good but is it possible to create our
own WindowsPrincipal :</p>
<p>I mean to do something like that</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetPrincipalPolicy(</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New
MyOwnWindowsPrincipal(&quot;domain&quot;, &quot;UserName&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;));</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>instead</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetPrincipalPolicy(</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.Security.Principal.PrincipalPolicy.WindowsPrincipal);</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or should I use Custom Authentication and base my development on the
&quot;Custom authentication solution&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the book I show how to do this with Silverlight, but the same technique works on WPF or any smart client scenario. You need to have your DataPortal_Fetch method for the identity object run on the server (in the domain) and load itself with the user&#39;s domain groups. The object that returns to the client is a custom principal, but at least it has the user&#39;s domain username and groups.</p>
<p>If you want to implement _impersonation_ on the server, that&#39;s harder. To do that you&#39;ll need the user to provide you with their domain password. Then on the server you can make a pretty simple call to a method on WindowsPrincipal (or WindowsIdentity?) to impersonate the user based on their username/password.</p>
<p>Obviously if you are ferrying the user&#39;s password around you&#39;ll want to encrypt it.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cconte replied on Monday, June 24, 2013</h2><p>Thanks a lot Rocky for your enlightenment.</p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;</span><span>take your advice and&nbsp;</span>I&#39;m starting to look at the windows authentifcation using silverlight technique.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
