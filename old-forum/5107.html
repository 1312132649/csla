However, I have a question.. its probably more design related but here goes :P<br><br>Here are my classes<br>User - Simply class to represent the application User<br>UserScorecards - List of UserScorecard Objects, User contains a reference to this object<br>UserScorecard - Used to represent a User Scorecard<br>Scorecard - Object used to represent a scorecard<br><br>Ok so each User has a list of scorecards (they can have more than 1)<br>The UserScorecard contains the ID (FK) of the Scorecard it represents. <br><br>What I am doing is binding the UserScorecards list to a GridView. However, I want to translate the ScorecardID to the Description of the scorecard instead of displaying the ID(foreign key). I do not anticipate changing the value so I do not want to use a DropDown box. <br><br>So right now the UserScorecard does not contain a reference to the scorecard is that the problem? Should I include a reference to the Scorecard object represented or is there an easy way (using maybe name/value pair) to translate the FK to the description? The reason I did not include the Scorecard object is because a Scorecard is not only used as a child of a UserScorecard (is that a switchable object then??)<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, July 16, 2008</h2><P>I am not sure why you have a 4th class. Normally all you need are the first three.</P>
<P>When you Fetch the UserScorecard it has the ID but not the Description, right?</P>
<P>Well then add the Description to the class as a "borrowed field" and populate it as part of your object when you fetch the data. Two ways to do that - 1. JOIN 2 DB tables in a query.&nbsp; 2. Use the one DB table to populate as normal, close the dr and then hit the DB once more using the ID to fetch the Description.</P>
<P>HTH</P>
