We purposefully structured the job description to focus on a &quot;web developer&quot; so we didn&#39;t limit ourselves to one technology - I thought it could be useful to expand the boundaries of knowledge/experience of my department.</p>
<p>So, if I actually hire this person, we will have some interesting challenges regarding sending data back and forth to our new web-based LOB apps, and I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any ideas and/or resources for accomplishing this.&nbsp; Do I start reading up on SOA architectures?&nbsp; Our apps aren&#39;t necessarily crossing &quot;trust boundaries&quot;, so I&#39;m not sure (after 20 minutes of Google) that this is the correct path to start down. But I&#39;ve been so locked into my little Microsoft world that I really don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there for me.</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>In a more general sense, if they build sites largely outside of the Microsoft stack, then you probably don&#39;t have a lot of choice - a service-oriented solution is about all you&#39;ve got.&nbsp; You may not be crossing a &quot;trust boundary&quot;, but environmental differences are another kind of boundary.&nbsp; If they&#39;re different enough, integrating CSLA directly into their solution may not be possible.&nbsp; Obviously there have been attempts to get CSLA working in non-MS environments, but from what I can tell they have had limited success (largely dependent on the level of compatibility the particular environments have built into their porting of the .NET framework).</p>
<p>You may also have issues if they choose the &quot;Web 2.0&quot; route - i.e. a very JavaScript/AJAX-heavy environment.&nbsp; Depending on how you&#39;ve built your CSLA objects, they may not play as well in that kind of asynchronous environment without some modifications.&nbsp; I believe that will also pretty much require a service layer, since you couldn&#39;t get the DataPortal to play well with JSON.&nbsp; To be honest, sites built in this methodology are a whole different architectural beast - they generally are much more service-oriented, and there is (at least to me) a somewhat distressing level of business logic contained within Javascript and whatever server-side platform is used (the very duplication that CSLA&nbsp;helps you to&nbsp;to avoid).&nbsp; But you have similar&nbsp;issues with &quot;straight&quot; ASP.NET/MVC sites as well...</p>
