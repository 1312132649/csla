<P>I just notice that we can't have validation rules on a ReadOnly Object (Hoped I'm not missing anything)</P>
<P>in my scenario&nbsp;I'm using Warning &amp; Info severity a lot and sometimes I need have to add a new error validation where we've actually have it's broken in our database.</P>
<P>and the problem is I need to implment those rules on my readonly object so users can see the informations and for the error rules they will do some fixes. </P>
<P>currently I forced to use editable object event though I'm not using them for editing.</P>
<P>FYI, I usually using ReadOnlyCollection for may data broser and then use EditableRoot for the Insert/Edit </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Regards</P>
