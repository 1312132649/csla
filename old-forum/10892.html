<p>I have a need to change a few behaviours of core Csla so I override the odd method here and there. My problems is there are several methods that are private or not virtual so I need to actually make changes to the Csla code. Obviously I&#39;d really like to avoid that.</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can achieve this without changing the core Csla code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: just to clarify: the changes I make in the Clsa code are to tag methods, etc. as virtual or protected. I don&#39;t actually plumb any logic changes in those methods.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
