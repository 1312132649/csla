<P>DataPortal.Fetch failed (Index was outside the bounds of the array.)</P>
<P>I've been stepping through the code and I can see that we're hitting the BeginFetch and FetchCompleted code but I can also see that we never hit the server code for the BO.</P>
<P>I've triple checked everything in the project but I must still be missing something.</P>
<P>Any ideas?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CampbellCM replied on Tuesday, April 07, 2009</h2><P>Never mind.&nbsp; I checked again and I had defined the wrong Fetch methods in the ROLB.&nbsp; I had Child_Fetch instead of DataPortal_Fetch.</P>
