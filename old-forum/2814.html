I hope it will be usefull for all of us. Maybe you could point out some situations and gotchas you had that are not book example, where some tricks should be used or that can't be done with NHibernate. For example mapping one class on multiple tables.</P>
<P>Anyway, tnx a lot for your effort</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
