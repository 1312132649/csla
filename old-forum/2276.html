<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>I am looking for an experienced programmer willing to cooperate in a medical software project. I am a Dutch pediatric intensivist with a keen interest in software development for medical purposes. I did not receive any formal IT training but managed to create a functional multi-tier application with help from the excellent books published by Rockford Lhotka. Of course the CSLA framework is the basis of this application. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>However, as I am limited in programming knowledge and experience and most of all time, it is difficult for me to further expand this application. There are several commercial products available that claim to offer the same functionality as I try to achieve with my own application. Unfortunately, medical practice is very difficult to translate to IT solutions. Furthermore, these solutions apply to a limited market and are therefore very expensive and commercially not that attractive. Also, they cannot fulfill the requirements needed for use in complex ICU environments.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Another approach would be the ‘Linux idea’: To develop these kinds of medical solutions as GNU projects. That does not mean that I am looking for volunteers, however, they are more than welcome. I probably also can manage funding for payment for a programmer for about a half a year.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>So, this is kind of a job advertisement but I can not give the specific details yet. I first would like to know if there are programmers, preferably Dutch who would be interested. Preferably Dutch because the hospital I work at, is the University Medical Center in Utrecht, the Netherlands</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The project would be to create a CPOE, a Computerized Physician Order Entry application for use in adult, pediatric and neonatal intensive care units. This should be a CSLA based application using a SQL-server as database and both a Windows and a Web interface.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>I am eager to see any response...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>simon_may replied on Monday, February 05, 2007</h2><P>Hi cwb. An interesting project. I have been working with CSLA.Net for about two years. Much of that time has been devoted to building a set of tools to improve system development productivity. The key objective is to enable low cost development of proof of concept/prototypes that can be easily developed on to fully fledged commercial applications. I am particularly interested to work with domain experts that can help me undersatand how they need to relate to the technical design from their domain requirements. </P>
<P>Should this approach be of interest pleas contact me</P>
<P>Regards </P>
