<p>My choice seems to be between one of two strategies:</p>
<p>Get a &quot;real&quot; notebook computer that has the horsepower to run VS and Sql Server at a pace I can deal with</p>
<p>Get a netbook and just use a remote connection to my desktop when I need to use the VS and Sql Server environment.</p>
<p>Of course, if there are netbooks in the 3 or 4 pound range that can run a development environment, that would be great.&nbsp; And I&#39;m only <strong>guessing</strong> that this is not the case.&nbsp; So I ask you .... have you tried running VS 2008 or 2010 on one of the popular netbook offerings (ASUS, Acer, Dell mini, etc?).&nbsp; Was it abysmal as I suspect, or can you work with it for a few hours and not lose your mind (assuming I have access to a real monitor for that work).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, November 08, 2010</h2><p>I have an Acer Aspire 1420P. It is a small, lightweight dual core Celeron running Win7 Ultimate x64. It has 4 gigs of memory (8 was too spendy, but would be better).</p>
<p>For low-end dev work it is OK, but I&#39;m use to full-blown 4 or 8 core machines with 8+ gigs of RAM, so I must say the Acer always feels quite sluggish. </p>
<p>Still, it is my go-to-meetings and travel machine because it is so lightweight (and it does multi-touch, which is really nice on a plane) and the battery lasts around 5 hours. Sluggish or not, if I&#39;m not doing heavy dev work or demos at a conference it is workable.</p>
<p>I find RDP to be a little iffy when working with modern development. XAML and HTML5 are too animation-heavy to do well via RDP in most cases - but then again, perhaps that&#39;s because I&#39;m usually connecting from a hotel where the bandwidth is saturated and unreliable...</p>
<p>You mention a monitor - and that&#39;s a big deal. The Acer is only 720 vertical, which is way too small. My new desktop monitor is 1024 vertical, and that&#39;s not enough either. This fascination with &quot;HD compliant&#39; computer monitors is really dumb, and I hope the industry moves past this quickly - apparently only Dell still sells real monitors with decent vertical resolution (I want at least 1200)&nbsp;:(</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Monday, November 08, 2010</h2><p>Same situation for me. My desktop is quadcore and 8GB of RAM. So I know I&#39;m going to be stepping down significantly in a portable machine.</p>
<p>I agree on the monitor size issue, too.&nbsp; In my office, I always work with two.&nbsp; So just being limited to one on the road is a relative hardship.&nbsp; So that ONE has to offer decent performance.</p>
<p>Thanks for this input!</p>

<p>Lets not&nbsp;forget&nbsp;Glossy screens. I personally hate those things with all my hart, If you what a laptop with a matte screen then you need to get a &quot;business&quot; laptop, I don&#39;t get it.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, November 08, 2010</h2><p>Yeah, the glossy screen thing isn&#39;t great. But touch screens are glossy, so mine is glossy - it is a tradeoff.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m with you - I&#39;d pay extra to get a business laptop to get a matte screen unless I was after touch (and I must say that multi-touch is really nice).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Monday, November 08, 2010</h2><p>I have an LG Flatron monitor with 1920 x 1200 resolution&nbsp;attached to my dell studio-xps,&nbsp; I just walked into best buy and picked up the monitor.&nbsp; I think it was in $300-380 range. I am pretty happy with it.</p>
