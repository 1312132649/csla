<p>Anything special I need to do ?</p>
<p>Once I get it loaded, do I just build it and run the resulting install app to get the templates?</p>

<p>Once you have the vsix installer you run it to install into VS2010.</p>
<p>The original intent was to publish these templates (vsix installer) on Visual studio Gallery. <br />NuGet deployment has also been discussed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>comp1mp replied on Sunday, November 20, 2011</h2><p>Do you still plan on releasing to Visual Studio Gallery?</p>
<p>I noticed the Nuget link on the Csla source download page and downloaded the Nuget Package Manager in VS Extension Manager. I installed Csla for Windows Forms. Pretty slick! Its like the app store for Visual Studio.</p>
<p>One Question. Should the Nuget installer have created a Csla components section in my Toolbox with the ReadWriteAuth component etc.?</p>
