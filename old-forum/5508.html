<P>I have Microsoft Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2008 SP1 installed. I tried to create a Sliverlight project, by default it created page.xaml.

<p>I have Microsoft Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2008 SP1 installed. I
tried to create a Sliverlight project, by default it created page.xaml. I was
trying to put a button (From Silverlight XAML Controls), but I cannot. Do I
must use Expression Blend to do that? Or did I do something wrongly?<o:p></o:p></p>
