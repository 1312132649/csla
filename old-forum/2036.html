<P>Just wondering if anyone had a good solution for the tendency of the system to add duplicate objects to my collections upon page refresh.&nbsp;&nbsp; This happens if an 'Add' button is used to create a child object that is placed into a collection.&nbsp; If the 'Refresh' button is hit the entire 'Add' routine fires again.</P>
<P>I can come up with a couple of haxxor ways around it, just wondering if there is something elegant out there.</P>
<P>For example, under no circumstances should any of my objects be identical so I could create a 'compare' based on all the properties - seems kind of haxxor to me though.&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone got something better?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, December 28, 2006</h2><P>I use the RefreshTrapper HttpModule from Dino Esposito.</P>
<P>He wrote an article on it a while back. I am sure Google can find it.</P>
<P>The basic idea is to detect when a Refresh occurs and treat it differently than a postback.</P>
<P>Should solve the problem you are seeing.</P>
