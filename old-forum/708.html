<P>I'm working in Win right now to just do quick test-harnesses for my BOs which will eventually be used in an ASP.Net app. I'm sure this is pretty straightforward but I can't seem to figure out what I need to drag where :).</P>
<P>Thanks. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Monday, July 24, 2006</h2><P>I think you do mean data sources. Click on Data | Show Data Sources to show your data sources. You can create a new one from there, choosing your business object. Make sure you have a form open in design view, then you can drag your data source properties onto the form.</P>
<P>If you click the drop down arrow on the&nbsp;right of the data source, you can change the control it will use.</P>
