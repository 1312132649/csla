<p>Does anybody have any examples of using CSLA with MVVMLight?&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to figure out how to hook up the WCF and DataPortal calls.&nbsp; I see the BeginRefresh in samples using CSLA but that is using the ViewModel from the CSLA foundation that is build with Generics.&nbsp; Does anybody have any suggestions or resources I might could use?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have looked into Caliburn.Micro and my recommendation is to &quot;merge&quot; most of the Csla.Xaml.ViewModel into the ViewModel base class in your selected UI framework.This is available for Csliburn.Micro in http://cslacontrib.codeplex.com (goto Source tab and download latest source)</p>
<p>I&#39;d be interested in publishing similar code for MvvmLight on Codeplex if you can share the code with the community!!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dblwizard replied on Wednesday, May 16, 2012</h2><p>I&#39;ll be glad to when I get it working.&nbsp; Are there any examples out there that don&#39;t use the &quot;ViewModel&quot; object to do the delegate and data transfer?&nbsp; Seems all the samples I find use the ViewModel inheritance to implement that.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, May 17, 2012</h2><p>I think that all the samples do use the base class because it simplifies coding.</p>
<p>But you can look at the ViewModelBase code itself to see what is done. The code in that class could be written directly in your code-behind, or in your own viewmodel base class, or your own viewmodel. It isn&#39;t that terribly complicated, but it isn&#39;t the sort of code I want to write in every viewmodel, and that is why I put it in a base class.</p>
