I'd like to trigger a recomputation in the parent based on changes to an object in the list.</P>
<P>If a property of a child&nbsp;object in the BLB is changed, then OnChildChanged is called with listArgs only, and propertyArgs is null. </P>
<P>Is this what I should be expecting? </P>
<P>There are some other bugs that may have subsequently been addressed that this behavior changes after the object has been deserialized (e.g. deserializing causes an event to be explicitly hooked that then causes OnChildChanged to be invoked with propertyArgs provided). </P>
<P>I've looked at the 2008 book but it doesn't clarify this particular idiosyncrasy.</P>
