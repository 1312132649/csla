The form controls are just bound to the BindingSource.<br /><br />Thanks for any advice.<br /><br />-Jason</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Saturday, March 26, 2011</h2><p>Hi Jason, </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on csla.mono and had the same experience. </p>
<p>BindingSource in Mono does not work properly with objects and I have no workaround to offer. <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-42.gif" alt="Confused" /></p>
<p>One possibility might be to reimplement BindingSource or contribute updates to BindingSource in Mono but this is fairly complex code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW: Look out for Csla 4.2 - read more here <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Roadmap.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Roadmap.aspx</a></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TygreWolf replied on Sunday, March 27, 2011</h2><p>Hey Jonny!<br /><br />First off, thanks for all the hard work in getting this ported over to Mono.&nbsp; Unfortunately for my current project I don&#39;t have the time to take on such a daunting task as rewriting BindingSource in Mono (thought it sounds like a cool side-project).&nbsp; Looks like spaghetti code is what I&#39;ll be using for this task.<br /><br />As far as CSLA is concerned, though, everything seems to be working great so far with the code I have.&nbsp; We&#39;ll just have to wait and see what the future of Mono holds as far as the support for System.Windows.Forms goes.&nbsp; I know that BindingSource isn&#39;t the only thing they&#39;re having difficulties with (SplitContainer currently crashes Mono, even).&nbsp; Too bad GTK# doesn&#39;t support databinding at all.&nbsp; That may have been a good approach, as well.<br /><br />Thanks again!<br /><br />-Jason</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kathlencal replied on Monday, March 28, 2011</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>JonnyBee<br></b></p>
