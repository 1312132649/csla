I've searched the forum archives and have found some sophisticated discussions on the issue, but I'd sure like to see a version of PTWeb that uses the ASP.Net 2.0 Membership framework.</P>
<P>Does anyone have any ( prefereably C# ) code to share that illustrates how this works in a basic scenario ?</P>
<P>(Remote data portal issues are interesting, but I want to get the basics down first ).</P>
