<P>I've done a single-selection drop down list before by binding to an Integer property on my object.....no problem.</P>
<P>But now I've got a multi-select list box on the UI and I need to create a new property on the object to bind to.&nbsp; What is the best way to create a property to handle this multiple selection?</P>

<P dir=ltr>I had 2 initial ideas, but I don't think they're a good solution:</P>
<P>1.) Try to use a string property and somehow store/bind the selections as a comma separated string.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure this will NOT work.<BR></P>
<P>2.) Create a property that contains a collection of "Option" objects.&nbsp; The "Option" object would&nbsp;have 3 properties: Id (Integer), Description (String), Selected (Boolean).&nbsp; I think I could get this to work but I have doubts about whether this is a good solution.</P>
<P>Multi-select list boxes are a commonly used control.....so surely someone else has run into this.&nbsp; Can anybody make some suggestions or give examples of how you've handled this?&nbsp; </P>

<P>Make the BO property of type YourEnum, and since it's a flagged enum, you can use a mask to check which one is active/inactive. Then it becomes a matter of making the UI control display those properly.</P>
<P>If you need to map some more data to each enum, like a description etc, then a dictionnary&lt;MyEnum, MyEnumInfo&gt; could be used, where MyEnumInfo would hold all thge necessary data associated with each option.</P>
<P>How does that sound ?</P>
<P>Regards</P>

<P>But I'm struggling with the Selected (Boolean).</P>
<P>How did you bind the boolean "Selected" property on your busines object to the "Selected" property on the ListItem?</P>
