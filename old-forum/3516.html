I have business case where I need to ensure a child record exists before a parent record is saved. How should I accomplish this? Can the parent see the childList's count property in a broken rule? <BR></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, September 11, 2007</h2><P>I'd probably place the validation rule on the parent object, attach it to the property name equal to that of the collection's property name - and then attach an event handler to the collection's listchanged event - at which point I would raise PropertyHasChanged for the property name (on the parent) -- the validation rule attached would simply look at the count of the collection and determine it's broken status. </P>
<P>i.e. your broken rule doesn't exist on the collection persay - it's a broken rule for parent of the collection. Collections don't have the capacity for having broken rules themselves. </P>

<P>The BO that contains the collection should have the rule.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
