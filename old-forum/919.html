I have searched all over to no avail so hopefully someone can help me out. I had a good start on this, I though, however his code is in VB and mine C#</P>
<P>This is what his constructor looks like in VB</P><PRE>Public MustInherit Class ActiveBusinessBase(Of T As BusinessBase(Of T))
  Inherits BusinessBase(Of T)
  Implements IActiveBusinessBase
  Implements ISafeSubscriber
</PRE>
<P>This is what my constructor Looks like:</P><PRE>public abstract class SCBusinessBase : Csla.Core.BusinessBase where T : SCBusinessBase, ISubscriber</PRE>
<P>With this constructor I get the following error on compilation in my derived class: <BR>"The type MyDerivedClass must be convertible to Observer.ISubscriber in order to use it as a parameter T in the generic type or method SCBusinessBase. </P>
<P>So I make MyDerivedClass implement the same interface (ISubscriber). Then I get errors such as: <BR><BR>"Cannot Convert from SCBusinessBase to Observer.ISubscriber" </P>
<P>I have also tried this: </P><PRE>public abstractclass SCBusinessBase : BusinessBase where T: SCBusinessBase</PRE>
<P>And several other possibilities. So my question is, how can I extend BusinessBase with my own base class and not have to recode what is already in BusinssBase in the framework?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Wednesday, August 16, 2006</h2>T (or whatever you name your type parameters) are defined in class definitions or static member definitions.<br><br>public abstract class SCBusinessBase&lt;T&gt; : Csla.BusinessBase&lt;T&gt;, ISubscriber<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where T : SCBusinessBase&lt;T&gt;<br>{<br>}<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rkelley replied on Wednesday, August 16, 2006</h2><P>Brian, </P>
