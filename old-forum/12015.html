I have a large process going through a list of objects and it may take some time, so it would be good if the UI could see the state of the process.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>That is not possible by the DataPortal as-is.</p>
<p>You may create your own WCF Dual Channel or use SignalR to send messages but that would have to be in addition to the CSLA DataPortal.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pegesaka replied on Tuesday, June 11, 2013</h2><p>Thanks for the quick reply Jonny. Changed my design anyway to do it all in the UI, where progress can be monitored.</p>
<p>I would image though that a data intensive, slow process done on the app server would require some sort of feed back to the UI regarding progress. Are there any plans to implement anything?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, June 11, 2013</h2><p>No, there is no plan to implement this in the DataPortal.</p>
<p>The DataPortal must support a number of protocols/implementations and we have (to my knowledge) no plans to implement a duplex channel.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
