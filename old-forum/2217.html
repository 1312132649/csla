<P>My first experience with a UML tool was with Rational Rose when employed at Coca-Cola in Atlanta.&nbsp; Due to my experience with Rational, I looked at both it and Sparx before finally opting to go with EA.&nbsp; All told, I've been quite pleased with my selection of EA.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pelinville replied on Monday, January 29, 2007</h2><DIV>Love the Enterprise Architect.&nbsp; And for that price I don't think their is&nbsp;anything that come close.</DIV>
