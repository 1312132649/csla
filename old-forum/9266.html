<p>FYI, I downloaded the CSLA 4 RTM, and I get a compilation error when compiling the csla.silverlight.test project.&nbsp; The compilation error is in PropertyGetSetTests.cs.&nbsp; The 2 classes at the bottom of the file (Command and ReadOnly) have the Serializable attribute, but the compiler couldn&#39;t resolve it.&nbsp; I got it working by adding a&nbsp;using Csla.Serialization.&nbsp; Looks like these classes were added between RC1 and RTM?</p>
<p>Just thought I would let you know.</p>
<p>Thanks everybody for all the hard work on CSLA 4!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 23, 2010</h2><p>Ouch - egg on my face. Especially since I keep nagging people to run the unit tests before checking stuff in, and here I failed to do exactly that <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-10.gif" alt="Embarrassed" /></p>
<p>Yes, those classes were added to test a fix to LoadProperty - but I only ran them on the .NET side (as you can probably tell...)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
