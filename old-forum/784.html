That tab automatically displays any top-level posts (first post in a thread) from the CSLA .NET Contrib forum. </P>
<P>One good use for this, is by contributors to CSLAcontrib. As you add or update content in the project, you can put a top-level post in the forum to let people know what you've done and how they can use your new content.</P>
<P>Unfortunately comments to posts don't appear in the news tab, but there is a link beneath each news item so people can easily navigate here to see the full thread.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
