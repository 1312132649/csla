<p>To fully utilize the OO Model, A skeleton object model using an object manager can guarantee&nbsp; that each record in a table is read only one time per execution.</p>
<p>possibility, pro&#39;s and con&#39;s?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, December 10, 2012</h2><p>I have never even considered it and do not intend to use it either. </p>
<p>My apps are running on several nodes/server and the synchronization point is the transactional database. Just my thoughts... </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, December 10, 2012</h2><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen such a requirement; typically each client would read the most recent data from the database.&nbsp; If needed within a single client, this isn&#39;t too hard to manage, usually by seeing if the application already knows the object is being edited and just focusing the window containing the object.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re concerned about data collisions, I&#39;d implement optimistic concurrency.&nbsp; Add a timestamp column to the &quot;main&quot; record and compare it before you update; if they are different abort the transaction.&nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Aboubkr90 replied on Wednesday, December 12, 2012</h2><p>I&#39;m not concerned about collision but network traffic.</p>
<p>I&#39;m faced with an application that is supposed to run a database over the internet, And with the currently available resources a local (the LAN side) data access| business logic server with a skeleton objects will help a lot.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
