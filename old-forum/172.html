<br>
I don't think you shound change the machine.config, I' think you
problem is just a special case. I don't use development instance, just
use Http://localhost/..., I make post build event&nbsp; copy all the BO
to the destionation web folder, and remoting always works. Some error
occured&nbsp; I use remoting like forget [Serialiable()] attribute on
BO, DTC Security configuration is eazy to solve.<br>
<br>
And I also use vmware install a virtual pc, try use clickonce
publishing on the virtual pc, also use remoting access on the virtual
pc, it's work's fine. So my suggestion is if you have vmvare, try to
install a "clean" server, a "clean" client, "clean" means no other
application installed, test it, otherwise install a real clean one,
test it.<br>

Development Instance works just fine. The problem is in my real instance (http://localhost/...).<br>The problem is that it will not connect to a sql server in another machine (i'm logging in with sql security with sa user) (and jic: no, i'm not planning on keeping sa, just doing this for testing).<br><br>So, I'm developing on PC1 and i'm using remoting on IIS on PC1.<br>The web.config has a connection string pointing to PC2. It is not using windows security and it's trying to log in with sa as username. This same connection string works just fine in development instance and also if i don't use remoting (local dataportal).<br><br>From what I've been able to gather this is an issue related with the security policy of user ASPNET and the restrictions it applies on aspnet_wp.exe.<br>I will attempt to gather more info (probably not this week) on this subject and if I get something valuable I'll post it. In the meantime if anybody knows anything about this, please let me know.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h2>One thing you might try for debugging is to add an aspx page to your virtual root and have that page try to talk to the database. Though it is easy to think of the virtual root as only a Remoting endpoint, the fact is that the virtual root is technically an ASP.NET application, and so it can run aspx pages. That may make debugging easier - in that at least you can easily output information about the environment, etc.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Dawn replied on Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h2>Hi Andrés.<br>
<br>
I test exact like you setting. First time exception occurs, like this<br>
<br>
"Principal must be of type BusinessPrincipal, not System.Security.Principal.GenericPrincipa"<br>
<br>
And I check my code, i fetch something from the dataportal before I do
login in, beacuse i want do a little more stuff in the application
start up stage. so, in the main function, i add a line
MyCustomerPrincipal.Logout() which create a BusinessPrincipal, it's
work expact my firewall ask if let the asp_wp.exe go out.<br>
<br>
Hope this help.<br>

You MUST have a valid (though unauthenticated) business principal set up before you ever try to call the data portal.
