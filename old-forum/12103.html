<p>I have been using the friendly name in the property info to provide proper business rule messages. My problem now is that I need to have my application run in more the one locale. I saw this post http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/6888.aspx where JonnyBee says to put the friendly name into a resource file and then use that to easily translate the friendly names.</p>
<p>My problem is I tried this, I have two resource files in my application. Resources.resx and Resources.fr-CA.resx. The friendly name seems to successfully pull from Resources.resx at application start but when I switch languages the friendly name doesn&#39;t pull from the correct file and just shows from the default Resources.resx.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas of what I&#39;m missing?</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Saturday, August 03, 2013</h2><p>Which type of application (web, SL, WPF, WinForms) do you have? </p>
<p>
You would typically not  change language after startup in a rich client. </p>
<p>
My first solution was to load from resource when application start up (the users Culture).
</p>
<p>
For a web application is more complex -  as this requires your own IPropertyInfo that reads from resource file on each read of FriendlyName.</p>
<p>RegisterProperty is only called once per property (as it is static) so&nbsp;</p>
<p><ol>
<li>You may create your own PropertyInfoFactory to set the friendly name from resource file (but only one selected/active language in a &quot;rich&quot; client)</li>
<li>You may subclass PropertyInfo and change FriendlyName to read from resource file. Then your custom PropertyInfoFactory must create the new subclassed PropertyInfo. This will work for a web application / application server as well.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>I only needed 1 for &quot;rich&quot; client in edge application.&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
