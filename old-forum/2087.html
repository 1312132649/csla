<P>I am <EM><U>considering</U></EM> upgrading my PC to Vista but I have a number of questions and I wonder if anyone out there has any experience of using it and could give me answers?</P>
<P>A) I currently have a Windows XP SP2 PC with a dual core processor and 2 Gb of Ram so I think it's high enough spec.&nbsp; It has my development environment installed on it and working.&nbsp; If I ran a VISTA upgrade into my box to go from XP SP2 --&gt; Vista would the current VS2005 and SQL Server 2005 installs be damaged in any way?</P>
<P>B) Is VS 2005 fully tested with Vista?&nbsp; Is anything that works on SP2 now likely to stop working if I were to upgrade?</P>
<P>C) What version of Vista does a developer using VS 2005 need?&nbsp; Do we have to go all the way to Ultimate or is one of the Business editions good enough?</P>
<P>D) Are there any other nasty problems that I would need to know about before embarking on this upgrade?</P>
<P>E) Most importantly of all; does Vista have any snagging issues that will stop CSLA.net from working?</P>
<P>Thanks very much for bothering to read this; I know that Vista isn't out properly yet , and so folk may not be able to answer this but any feedback would be very gratefully received.</P>
<P>Cheers</P>

<P>This does make me feel a little unsure of whether an upgrade is the best way to go though.</P>
<P>Any feedback on the questions above gratefully received :)</P>

<P>If I were you I'd use some app like Ghost or Drive Image to create a backup so you could fall back from Vista to your current XP SP2 installation. <BR>Best of luck, let us know how you progress with running VS2005 on Windows Vista</P>

<P>I coudn't agree more :)&nbsp; I doubt i'll be rushing into this but i have to admit I'm a bit intrigued to see Vista as I haven't really seen it in action yet.</P>
<P>This isn't really a high priority for me as my current box works really well and i'm sadly not getting any work that would use CSLA or even .NET at the moment... what a waste :(</P>
<P>Cheers</P>

<P>I am very much under the impression that VS does not work well with Vista yet. I would definitely wait until "VS 2005 SP1 For Vista" comes out in a month or 2. MS released VS2005 SP1 for older platforms already because the alternative would be to make everyone else wait just for the Vista upgrade bits which most people don't want yet anyway.</P>

Not sure for this new release.<br><br>- Izhido<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Thunderstruck replied on Monday, January 08, 2007</h2>I have a co-worker who has been messing with Vista for quite some time, and VS2005 will definately not work with it.&nbsp; As JoeFallon1 said, there is a patch coming out that fixes this issue.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Tuesday, January 09, 2007</h2><P>Not work?&nbsp; I have been running VS2005 and CSLA&nbsp;on Vista for about a month now and haven't had any issues once I was able to get it running in the first place.&nbsp; First off, make sure you install SP1.&nbsp; There is also a Vista SP1 beta for VS2005, but I haven't seen any difference to using that or not at all.&nbsp; The real trick is that you need to run VS2005 in admin mode.&nbsp; This can be done by either right clicking and Run as Administrator, or for a more permanent solution, go to the properties of devenv.exe, click the compatibility tab and click the "Run this program as an administrator"</P>
<P>I don't use every bit of VS2005, so I can't verify that EVERYTHING works.&nbsp; Just everything I have tried which is quite a bit.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cmellon replied on Wednesday, January 10, 2007</h2><P>Hi,</P>
<P>I too have Vista 64 Bit installed and VS2005 runs ok, not had any issues as yet.</P>
<P>I'll let you know if I encounter any, only been using for last couple of weeks and haven;t done much development on it as of yet apart from fired up a couple of projects to make sure they still worked.</P>
<P>(I did read somewhere about some issues with IIS thats build into Vista.&nbsp; Can;t remember where the post was, might be worth doing a search on the forum for Vista see what comes up if you have't already done so)</P>
<P>Regards</P>

<P>Also, IIS 7.0 has had steeper learning curve then I would have expected, but that's completely unrelated.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
