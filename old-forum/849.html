(esp on the subject of content management app).<br>Do anyone would like to share their advice and experience is very much appreciated.&nbsp; Thx in advance.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jules_ce replied on Wednesday, August 09, 2006</h2>I too am interested in this CRC topic, but have also run into problems trying to find really practical examples, especially related to where they fit into whichever methodology one is using.<br><br>So here's a little *bump* for this topic - if anyone can share some thoughts?<br><br>Thanks!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>yipchunyu replied on Thursday, August 10, 2006</h2>jules_ce,<br>do u have any advice in designing a content management system to share?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, August 10, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>jules_ce:</strong></div><div>I too am interested in this CRC topic, but have also run into problems trying to find really practical examples, especially related to where they fit into whichever methodology one is using.<br></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>The book "Object Thinking" by David West has some good content around CRC based design, and he has some examples in the book.<br><br>I think that you can use CRC as part of almost any methodology, just as you might use JAD or any other analysis/design technique. CRC isn't a methodology, it is just a technique. So at the point in your methodology where design is required, you can just use CRC instead of (or along side) other design techniques.<br><br>In West's book he focuses specifically on using CRC as part of an Agile methodology - and the two do work well together. But I've used CRC in more structured engagements. (When working as a consultant, the lack of documentation in Agile can be fatal. Like it or not, CYA is a requirement in many engagements, and that means documentation...)&nbsp; In that case, CRC is great for the design work, and then we translate the design into UML (class diagrams at least) for documentation purposes.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
