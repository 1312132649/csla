<P><STRONG>Problem Statement:</STRONG> We are having problem in finding the best way for handling and communicating&nbsp;Business Errors. The business errors can occur on client as well as on server. We need a uniform way of handling business errors. </P>
<P>We can not use BrokenRules collections because of Legacy systems complex validation processes which are out side of the entity and they are SET based. </P>
<P>Can we add business errors to GlobalContext&nbsp;so that&nbsp;other calling server side and client side methods can check the GlobalContext for the error key and take action.</P>
<P>Is this Thread safe? If I run 2 instances of my application on the same machine then will both the instances be able to get their own error message without stepping on each other.</P>
<P>The FACT that we have a WPF application, Does that makes a difference of how we access global context?</P>
<P>Please suggest appropriate way of handling such scenario.</P>

So while it is _safe_ in a threaded scenario, it probably won't do what you want - which would be to share values across threads.</P>
<P>WPF, btw, is not intrinsically multi-threaded. The UI elements of WPF are not threadsafe at all, and can only be manipulated by the main UI thread.</P>
<P>If you want to create some global repository for a list of broken rules in a WPF client you might consider hanging the values off the AppDomain. If I remember right, AppDomain has a "Tag" like construct (I don't remember what it is called) where you can put global values.</P>
<P>Obviously you'll have to create some threadsafe container object to manage all your broken rules in a way where they can be accessed and manipulated across multiple threads - no small task, especially if performance matters.</P>
<P>Good luck!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
