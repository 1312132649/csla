I have the following object structure:</P>
<P>Account (root) --&gt; Contacts (child collection) --&gt; Contact (child object) --&gt; Mailings (grandchild collection) --&gt; Mailing (grandchild object)</P>
<P>The problem I had in the 1.5 framework was that if I made a change in the Mailing grandchild object, there was no way in the default framework for the Account root object to be notified of the change.&nbsp; I ended up using ActiveObjects to get it work okay.</P>
<P>My question is whether or not this functionality has been added to the 2.0 framework, and if anyone has run into this issue, are there any "gotchas" that I need to look out for?&nbsp; In other words, do I still need to use ActiveObjects to get this functionality to work, or is it native to the new framework?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
