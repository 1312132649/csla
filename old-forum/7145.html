<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am the sole developer at my company (translated to I am the dba, .NET Architect, lead C# developer, and everything else that can be in the development world) and am trying to pick my architecture for the applications.&nbsp; Here is where I am leaning so far, Csla for the architecture (why would I pick anything else!)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The DB is SQL 2005 as I cannot convince our parent company to go to 2008 - any help in persuading them to go to 2008 would be greatly appreciated or why I should not go to 2008 would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Will be utilizng SQL Server Reporting Services for the reporting also.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The applications are to be web based either internat or intranet, leaning toward internet more.</P>
<P>1) for the small applications: <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) utilize the EF for the data modeling,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) utilize Silverlight 2 for the front end</P>
<P>&nbsp;2) for the large applications:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) would love to use EF, however I am wondering if it makes sense or would it make sense to just stick with ADO.NET.&nbsp; Linq to SQL is pretty much on it's way out but with so many tables, I am envisioning the Entity Data Model (EDM) to be a monster.&nbsp; Has anyone created a large application with EF and were you happy you did, or do you wish you hadn't?&nbsp; Your experience will be most appreciated.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) utilize Silverlight 2 for the front end</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I am working for a company that doesn't particularly like to spend $ on IT.&nbsp; Yes, I know, we are essential, and people get upset when things don't work and want it fixed, but, they think IT is overhead.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any perspective would be greatly appreciated and if Rocky or Sergey respond that would be awesome because their expertise and experience are golden in my book!</P>

<P>Use of an ORM gives you some degree of independence from the whims of Microsoft. You often have the source code, aren't tied to a particular technology that gets killed a few months after being the latest and greatest thing, and they support multiple back-end&nbsp;databases as well.&nbsp;Usually there are code generation tools to help. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, June 23, 2009</h2>I just started using SQL Server Reporting Services. I had wanted to do this a few years ago but it was severely lacking in functionality. As per the MS standard version 1.0 sucked and 2005 is quite a bit better with 2008 being very good. Their 3rd version of product is usally a world class piece of software. <br /><br />At any rate the one thing I learned is that the web service interface is identical for 2005 and 2008. I was able to use the proxy class to do everything in code that can be done in the UI. (Deploy models, data sources and reports.) The 2008 report builder is a huge improvement over 2005 for the end user .<br /><br />If you use Codesmith and design your ADO.Net code correctly for CSLA then I do not see why you should switch to a black box like Entity Framework. Especially if there are no other developers to assist you with the pain points of a new framework. Since it isn't version 3 yet I think you should wait one more cycle before committing to it. <br /><br />Just my $.02.<br />Joe</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
