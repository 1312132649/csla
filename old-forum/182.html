Otherwise it is a lot of code to write by hand, and the odds of making a mistake are very high.</P>
<P>This is basically the scheme I used in the old VB6 version of CSLA, and it worked just fine - but I was sure happy to move to .NET so it wasn't necessary to write the methods to get/set the state of your object <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />. While this sounds very helpful, it feels like a serious step back in time...</P>
<P>Again, if you are using code-gen then who cares really - because the template just contains the definition and you don't have to write the code.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
