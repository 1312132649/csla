<P>Why is the Provider() (which is a CslaQueryProvider) only in BusinessListBase and not in ReadOnlyListBase?</P>
<P>Does it mean that Linq expressions cannot be done on ReadOnlyListBase subclasses/implementations (such as filtering/grouping, etc)?&nbsp; I am still in the middle of doing upgrades so I haven't played with the new version yet.</P>
<P>I guess I can't wait for the new book which will explain all of this.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, April 10, 2008</h2><P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>BLB implements a custom query provider in order to modify how projections work, specifically to enable binding on results from Linq to objects queries over BLB.&nbsp; On the other hand, the nature of ROLB is that, since it is read only, binding from a projection (typically in a read only manner, such as a dropdown) does not require the original collection, hence, no need for a custom query provider.</FONT></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
