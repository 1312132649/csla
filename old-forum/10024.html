<p>I was helping a buddy with getting PTracker (win forms)&nbsp;running for csla.net 4.1.x.&nbsp; We kept getting an error on login ... something about &quot;dataportal_fetch ... access denied&quot;.&nbsp; Upon investigation I noticed that there was no dataportal_fetch in the PTIdentity.&nbsp; Also, there wasn&#39;t any dataportal_xxx anywhere to be found.&nbsp; Did something radical change in 4.1.x?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Look at the SimpleNTier and SimpleApp samples, they are much better at the moment.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>crussi replied on Thursday, February 03, 2011</h2><p>Thank you kindly Rocky!&nbsp; I haven&#39;t worked with Win Forms for some time, so, I hadn&#39;t noticed.&nbsp; I was doing this to help my buddy do some debugging.</p>
<p>Thank you for an incredible framework for developing distributed apps!&nbsp; I&#39;m sure you hear that a lot, but, my hope is that you haven&#39;t grown tired of hearing it.</p>
