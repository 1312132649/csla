Resource inside ResourceCollection contains&nbsp; ProjectCollection.<br>
<b>Every Resource the same time contains a collection TypesofWorkCollection.</b><br><br>Probably, it could be more variations.<br><br>The scenario 2 questions:<br>But, how to implement it using CSLA objects?<br>Lazy Loading all collections as they would be created at a different point of time?<br>Create all collection and later just AddChild as Child created?<br>How to assign TypesofWorkCollection and<b> </b>ProjectCollection to Resource as I see here many-to-many relationship.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 13, 2010</h2><P>Project &lt;-&gt; Resource is actually a M:M relationship, so ProjectTracker already demonstrates how to implement M:M, as well as 1:M.</P>
<P>I have yet to see a case where, in an OO design, there's a real argument for M:M like there is in the relational world. Since objects don't reflect just data, the nature of the relationships comes into play, and the relationships in a data-oriented M:M concept are (in my experience) never symmetric, and so the objects are never the same.</P>
<P>As I've said many times in the past, ProjectTracker is the demo app for the <EM>Expert Business Objects</EM> book. Therefore it has to meet certain requirements, not least of which is that I have to be able to describe the app (design and implementation) in just a couple chapters. That severely limits its size/complexity.</P>
<P>If I followed a different model, such as creating a more complex sample app that comes with the purchase of an ebook or video series focused on that app, that would break me out of the limitations of a paper book.</P>
<P>Or I could just create a large and complex sample app and give it away - but at the end of the day, like you, I need to generate income :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Pavel replied on Wednesday, January 13, 2010</h2>Thanks for a quick reply,<br><br>No, I do not want you to create ProjectTracker more complicated as I described it above.<br>I just wanted to see how some people deal with such a scenario, as I can see here lots of different approaches.<br>My problem is to figure out what is the right one regarding CSLA philosophy.<br><br>Pavel<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
