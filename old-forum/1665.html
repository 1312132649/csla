<P>I have used the csla framework to develop my windows app. I now want to develop a web app with the same business objects. My problem is that I am pretty new to building websites in 2005</P>
<P>In My Windows App my Business object were stored in a different project all in one solution and I had no problem referencing them</P>
<P>Now when i try to bring them into a new folder in the WebSite I am having trouble with referencing them.&nbsp;I do not want to change the objects to work on the website as then i would have 2 different sets of object which goes against our philosophy with csla... I am thinking its pretty simple and is not working due to my lack of experience. Could&nbsp;someone could help me with how to do this..</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, November 02, 2006</h2>You should just be able to use Add Reference to the binary.&nbsp; Is that not working for you?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jphegarty replied on Thursday, November 02, 2006</h2>I just added the new website to the&nbsp;existing solution instead of creating a whole new project and trying to add the existing business objects to that..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, November 02, 2006</h2>Oh ok.. did you try adding the business object project as a project reference?&nbsp; That should work as well.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
