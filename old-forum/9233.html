<p>Is it possible to improve the forum search experience here, or it totally just relying on some canned code?&nbsp; I find it only marginally useful, even though I know the wealth of data in these forums is immense.&nbsp; My wish list would be:</p>
<p>- Only one search result entry per entire&nbsp;thread</p>
<p>- sorted by most recent first (2006 discussions aren&#39;t very relevant)</p>
<p>I&#39;d settle for either one, but combined the power of the information contained here would be amazing.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 20, 2010</h2><p>The search on the forum is part of Community Server so it is what it is.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/search.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/search.aspx</a>, which uses google (or bing?) as a search engine across all lhotka.net content - it is often more useful.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
