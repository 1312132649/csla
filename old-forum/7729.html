Generally speaking, if a method opens a connection, that method should close it. Do you have methods that aren't closing your connections?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mjrod replied on Monday, October 05, 2009</h2>First thing, I'm new to CSLA, and the application I'm using isn't something I built.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am assuming that CSLA opens the connection reading from the app.config file as I see there are connection strings in there for the database.&nbsp; However, are you saying that you can create a connection and pass that as a reference to CSLA?<br><br>Forgive me, I'm just trying to understand and know what to look for.<br><br>Thanks for the help.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mjrod replied on Monday, October 05, 2009</h2>Rocky<br><br>You gave me the clue I needed and as I've gone through, I've discovered how it's implemented and the issue.<br><br>Thanks.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, October 05, 2009</h2>






 





<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>No, CSLA calls one of your methods (probably called
DataPortal_Fetch, DataPortal_Insert, etc &#8211; it will start with &#8220;DataPortal_&#8221;)
and in that method your code opens the database connection, uses it and
(should) close it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
