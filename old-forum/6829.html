<P>How should/could this sort of field-value security be implemented?</P>
<P>Ideally, any required data filtering would be done as part of the fetch's SQL so it doesn't return too much, only to be quickly discarded.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, April 21, 2009</h2>Well I think you answered your question.. filter the rows during your sql fetch.  You could store the location of the user in a custom principal, or some other location such as the ApplicationContext.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bpd replied on Wednesday, April 22, 2009</h2><P>Yes, but as I said, that was a <EM>simple</EM> example.&nbsp; A more representative example would be:</P>
<P>( (division = 1) and ( (location = 3) or (sales-rep = RK) ) )</P>
<P>The specific criteria would/could be different for each&nbsp;logical process of&nbsp;each role.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
