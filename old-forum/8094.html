<P>One important change is that I've switched from using nunit to using mstest. You should still be able (with a little work) to use nunit if you really need to, but I won't be using or testing with nunit.</P>
<P>This is primarily driven by the fact that I'm building on .NET 4 and I don't want to wait for nunit to catch up and stabilize. Mstest is already there and works, and is available in everything except VS Express.</P>
<P>This has no impact on YOUR TESTS - you can keep using nunit in your code all you want - this only impacts my framework tests.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
