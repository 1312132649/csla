<P>Is it possible to keep a "running total"? In other words, if the parent object were notified each time a specific child's specific property was changed, could it do an incremental adjustment?</P>
<P>Presumably this would require knowing the previous value too - but it may be worth coming up with a way to provide that. The previous post does that with a callback to the parent - which is totally workable. </P>
<P>Another Suppose the child had a Friend/internal PreviousWeight property?</P>
<P>public class Child : ...<BR>{<BR>&nbsp; private int _weight;<BR>&nbsp; private int _lastWeight;<BR>&nbsp; public int Weight <BR>&nbsp; { <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get { return _weight; }<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set { _lastWeight = _weight; _weight = value; PropertyHasChanged("Weight"); }<BR>&nbsp; }<BR>&nbsp; internal int LastWeight<BR>&nbsp; { get { return _lastWeight; } }<BR>}</P>
<P>Then your collection could update the TotalWeight value by backing out the LastWeight and adding in the new Weight each time it handles PropertyChanged for Weight. That'd be a lot faster than trying to recalc from scratch every time.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
