<P>I was curious as to how you organize your web projects.&nbsp; Right now I've attempted having a solution that contains a web project and a BO library project with the library referencing the CSLA frameworld .dlls.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if this is the best way to do it or not - any thoughts on organization?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Monday, August 14, 2006</h2><P>My web app also references CSLA, because I want to use SmartDate on occasion.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Wednesday, August 16, 2006</h2><P>The concept that MS is trying to force down our throats with VS 2k5 is that the web portion of the application should be separate from the underlying business objects, data, etc. (form vs. function).&nbsp; So, having your BOs in a separate library referenced from the web app is the right way to go.&nbsp; Add whatever other references you need to your web app depending on your needs, but try as hard as you can to not introduce any objects directly into the web app.</P>
<P>BTW - this separation fits right in line with CSLA and mobile business objects and you are encouraged (I guess forced was a bit harsh) to separate your code along logical boundaries naturally by VS.</P>
