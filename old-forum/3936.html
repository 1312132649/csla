I have all of Mr. Lhotka's books since VB6 Business Objects but have always been prevented from doing a full CSLA project.</P>
<P>My question is related to List objects. The objectInfo classes used in the BO books seem to be their own CSLA template, and are not editable child or read-only child objects. Is this correct?</P>
<P>What I want to accomplish is a very simple UI.</P>
<P>A output control (datagrid) is bound to a read only collection of objects. When a user selects edit, an editable root object is loaded.</P>
<P>In this case I believe I need one editable-root object, one readonly-list object, and what else?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>McManus replied on Monday, November 26, 2007</h2><P>Alfred,</P>
<P>Typically, you use&nbsp;a read-only child object in a read-only list. However, this is not a requirement. You can also use a "normal" class or even a struct.</P>

But you can use Other type of objects or structs also&nbsp;in ReadonlyList but is not recommended .</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Plowking replied on Tuesday, November 27, 2007</h2>Yep:<br><br>for your readonly list inherit ReadOnlyListBase<br>for your list items, inherit: ReadOnlyBase<br>for your editable root object, inherit: Business Base<br><br>The Project Tracker sample application has good examples of implementation, as does the class skeletons project.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
