For example, I use CodeSmith to generate a EditableRoot partial class "User" and then add another partial class "User". VS 2005 would not let me add another class named "User" in the class library, saying "a class named 'User' already exists." I have gotten around this by adding the custom partial class below the generated partial class in the same codefile. Is it possible to have a separate code files for partial classes with the same name? How would you do that? Thanks. <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Skafa replied on Saturday, October 07, 2006</h2>just name the files differently, like .Generated.cs and .User.cs (or place them in seperate folders) and use this syntax:<br><br>public partial class MyClass { }<br><br>note the use of the keyword 'partial' <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>David replied on Sunday, October 08, 2006</h2><P>I discovered (by chance) that if you add .Designer to the name, visual studio associates the two classes and hides the generated class in the same way it does with the generated code created for a windows form.</P>
<P>So if you have a Person class, add the <EM>user</EM> file first and call it Person.vb. Then add the <EM>generated</EM> class as Person.Designer.vb.</P>
<P>Obviously you will need to click the <EM>Show All Files</EM> button if you need to see the generated class.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>smark replied on Tuesday, October 10, 2006</h2>David, that's great information, thank you very much! I will try that out. It just seemed so un-intuitive to have two separate code files with names such as "PermissionCategoryGenerated.cs" and "PermissionCategoryCustom.cs" when all they contained were the public partial class "PermissionCategory".<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>smark replied on Tuesday, October 10, 2006</h2>Okay, it works. I first created a partial class "PermissionCategory.cs" and then generated the partial class "PermissionCategory.cs" and saved it as PermissionCategory.Designer.cs. Thanks.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
