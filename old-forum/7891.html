In a business object I have a managed csla property with the type of int. The property is bound to a textbox. ValidationRules are defined that specifies that the int must be lower than x, if violated an error message is displayed in a PropertyStatus control. But If the user enters non numerical characters in the textbox, I have no way of giving an appropriate error message in the PropertyStatus control. <br /><br />Unsatisfying solutions:<br /><br />I can use a converter that creates a popup message that displays an error message, stating that the entered text must be numerical. <br /><br />Mask the textbox input, but theres no out of the box way of doing this in wpf..<br /><br />Any ideas?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Wednesday, October 28, 2009</h2><P>Faced with the same issue here but thankfully I persuaded my client to purchase some WPF controls from Infragistics which has a MaskedEditBox control that does the job.&nbsp; I wanted then for the WPF grid and charting controls mostly.</P>
<P>I'd seriously look at some of the third party controls out there if possible.&nbsp; They save a load of time.</P>
