<P>It gave an example of a simple implementation of a TransactionScope style method for passing data around.&nbsp; This is kind of similar to our authorization and changed events in which they perform stack walks to determine what property is calling the CanRead or PropertyChanged methods.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I wanted to use something similar to pass parent information or root object stack information to child objects in their insert / update methods, they can just look at what parent is available in the scope of the call. In addition to parent / root information,&nbsp;I had needed to pass some audit information around as well, so if this works properly, it would alleviate the need for me to modify these methods.</P>
<P>Assuming no multi threading in my data methods, does anyone see any issues with passing data like this instead of explicitly passing it to the Insert / Update methods?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
