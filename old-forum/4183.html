If i am using field level security, if a given role cannot read a particular property, if i am using a stored procedure which is expecting all fields and when i read the afore mentioned property and it return an empty string it would update the field with an empty string, which is not correct. So what do people do who are using field based security and stored procs.<BR>Thanks <BR>Anthony</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Skafa replied on Thursday, January 17, 2008</h2>Normally you would use the accompying field for the property.<br>So when you have a property "Name" wich is stored in the field "_name". You would use the _name field in your DataPortal functions.<br><br>Using the new 3.5 GetProperty syntax is a different story: http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/20461.aspx<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vdhant replied on Thursday, January 17, 2008</h2><P>Ya i should have put that i was meaning 3.5. This makes sence and there is a fix for what i was after.<BR><A HREF="/forums/20503/ShowThread.aspx#20503">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/20503/ShowThread.aspx#20503</A><BR></P>
