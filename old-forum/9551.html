<p>for example: EditableRootList and ReadOnlyList</p>
<p>i &#39;m a newbie of Csla.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Saturday, September 18, 2010</h2><p>Each business type is designed to handle certain situations, the best places to get yourself up to speed are:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The CSLA book available in both physical and e-book form</li>
<li>The CSLA videos (non-silverlight)&nbsp;</li>
<li>The sample applications.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Basically the objects are broken into several categories:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>BusinessBase - Used for objects which are editable, have business (validation) rules and authorization</li>
<li>BusinessListBase - Used to have a single list of BusinessBase objects and allow bulk saving of the list all at once.&nbsp;</li>
<li>ReadOnlyBase &amp; ReadOnlyListBase - Used to have read-only objects (i.e. grids, combo-boxes, etc), no business rules apply.&nbsp;</li>
<li>NameValueList - A list that contains only two properties (key &amp; value), can be useful for combo-boxes, etc.<br /></li>
<li>DynamicList or EditableListBase - Used only for very specific situations where you want immediate saves of objects while working within a grid, should be avoided where possible.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>CSLA is an excellent framework, but is expected to used in a very&nbsp;different&nbsp;way that many programmers are used to; cannot recommend the book or videos enough if you are seriously looking at using it.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ddredstar replied on Sunday, September 19, 2010</h2><p>BusinessListBase allow bulk saving. So, if don&#39;t have to bulk saving, ReadOnlyListBase is enough, right?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Sunday, September 19, 2010</h2><p>Use ReadOnlyListBase&nbsp;only when&nbsp;you don&#39;t want to change and save the list items.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a price list.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Sales Manager use case, he can change the prices, add new products, remove (or mark obsolete) some other products. In that use case, a BLB should be used.</li>
<li>In the sales person use case, he just needs to get the product code, name, and price per unit. He can&#39;t change any of those. In this use case, a ReadOnlyListBase&nbsp;should be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can have several objects referring to the same piece of data (products and prices). What matters is how you are going to use the objects. You can/should have as many objects as your use cases dictate.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ddredstar replied on Sunday, September 19, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>tiago<br></b>In the Sales Manager use case, he can change the prices, add new products, remove (or mark obsolete) some other products.

<p>if i add or update or delete one product each time, use ReadOnlyListBase to fill grid is enough, right? my reason is that i can use BusinessBase to process single product each time, am right?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>tiago replied on Sunday, September 19, 2010</h2><p>Please refer to</p>
