<p>Thank you very much</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 25, 2012</h2><p>This isn&#39;t enough information for us to help you. At the very least we need to know the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>When does the exception occur?</li>
<li>What is the stack trace for the exception?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>roberto replied on Wednesday, January 25, 2012</h2><p>I developed a new sample app (wpf app),&nbsp; in order to reproduce same error as production code,<br />but everything works fine in this app, EF and CSLA as well. :(</p>
<p>This sample app is simpler than production code, where few &quot;improvements&quot; (ie: datasources managed programmatically) have been implemented.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have a look again at &quot;Option #1: Using Subreports&quot; sample app (available here http://www.gotreportviewer.com/masterdetail/index.html), because of some &quot;improvements&quot; are partially based&nbsp; on that sampe app.<br /><br />I&#39;ll be back with a new sample app, reproducing the error ... or fixing production code. :)<br /><br />Thak you very much.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
