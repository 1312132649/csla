<P>We have to restart the IIS Admin and WWW Publishing services to get the DataPortal responding again to client requests.</P>
<P>Now, while&nbsp;we are checking we've got exception handling everywhere within our code that might get executed on the portal side, has anyone else come across this problem at all?&nbsp; Could it be something else causing the problem?</P>
<P>We are IIS6, W2K3, CSLA 1.5x</P>
<P>In terms of clues, we did have one client trying an operation where a known bug was occurring - the ado connection was closed and then an attempt to close it again was causing an exception to be thrown and caught in our exception handling block.&nbsp; Maybe the IIS and/or DataPortal just freaked out as they repeatedly generated errors here?&nbsp;&nbsp; We've had this twice now over a period of 2 months so it's a rare but "stops everyone" kind of bug.</P>
<P>Thanks for any hints or advice.</P>
