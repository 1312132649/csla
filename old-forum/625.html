Just put the sqlconnection string in your web.config and communicate directly to the db.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Friday, July 14, 2006</h2>The serialization code does two major things.&nbsp; It handles remoting and enables the undo functionality.&nbsp; However, like much of Csla, it does not cost you if you do not use it.&nbsp; In your scenario, the calls will be made straight to the database without involving serialization.&nbsp; You probably should leave it in while you are learning the framework.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
