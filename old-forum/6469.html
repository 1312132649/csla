I know codeplex has a discussion place, but maybe there is some internal discussion possible.<br /><br />Who of the following people is still active?<br />link: http://www.codeplex.com/CSLAcontrib/People/ProjectPeople.aspx<br /><br />Allann<br />BrianCriswell<br />chrislw77<br />DaveRicker<br />DavidDilworth<br />davidwendelken<br />jtwebman<br />kdubious<br />KKoteles<br />Mobile5Guy<br />mtavares<br />pwelter34<br />rfcdejong<br />RichMark<br />RickySupit<br />TomCooley<br />Vinodonly<br />wcm777<br />xal1983<br /><br /><br />I also noticed the following projects:<br /><br />CodeGenTemplates<br />Csla2Extensions<br />CslaContrib<br />CslaVSTemplates<br />ErrorTreeView<br />Example.Utility<br />ProjectTrackerNHibernate<br /><br />I was thinking about creating an CslaContrib 3.6 version. Maybe i shouldn't do it all alone, but together with some other developers. I'll start wth the Smartxxx classes.<br /><br />Currently i'm able to connect with codeplex using Team Foundation Server Explorer and that works fine. Even the workitems are available for me :)<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Tuesday, February 24, 2009</h2><P>Just&nbsp;3 questions</P>
