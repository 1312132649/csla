What is the syntax to do this please?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 22, 2009</h2><P>So you are in WPF or Silverlight, and you want to invoke a method on an abitrary object (either the data provider or your business object) in response to a Click event?</P>
<P>Handle the event in code-behind, get the data provider from the Resources dictionary and invoke its Refresh() method. Several of the WPF/Silverlight sample apps get the data provider from Resources and interact with it in code-behind - just check through the sample apps.</P>
<P>Or search the web for the MVVM pattern. Even if you don't buy into the MVVM pattern itself, the first thing every MVVM framework/toolkit solves is the problem of invoking arbitrary methods in response to UI events (such as Click).</P>
<P>CSLA .NET for Silverlight has the InvokeMethod component that does this. In 3.6/3.7 there are limitations on what it can do. </P>
<P>In 3.8 the limitations are mostly removed, so InvokeMethod can handle any event (as far as I can tell) and can invoke methods on arbitrary objects (as long as they are bindable from XAML).</P>
<P>Also in 3.8 there's a new trigger action named Execute. The Execute action does much of what InvokeMethod does, but within the Blend 3 trigger framework model (which imposes certain limits).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Fele replied on Thursday, January 21, 2010</h2>Can somebody provide code example of calling MobileFactory object from (MVVM) model class?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, January 21, 2010</h2><P>var dp = new DataPortal&lt;Customer&gt;();<BR>dp.FetchCompleted += (o, e) =&gt;</P>
