But I'm full-time with a client most of this week and don't have time to check it (nor do I have a 2.1.4 dev environment anymore - I'm well into 3.0...).</P>
<P>Obviously there's either a bug in the test or in CSLA, and that's bad.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jason@Draftech replied on Wednesday, April 18, 2007</h2>Well, I admit to having very little experience with this framework so far.  Once familiar, I'll do my best to investigate the issue and post my findings.<br /><br />3.0... is there another book in the works as well?<br /><br />Regards ~ Jason</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, April 18, 2007</h2><P>I don't know for sure what I'm going to do for .NET 3.0/3.5.</P>
<P>Certainly I'm working on CSLA .NET 3.0 now, with an eye toward having it available this summer.</P>
<P>But .NET 3.5 and perhaps more importantly Visual Studio codename "Orcas" is due out this fall, and that includes real designer support for&nbsp;.NET 3.0.</P>
<P>So it is quite realistic to consider writing a "real" book (probably through Apress) - something like "Expert C#/VB ___ Business Objects", where "____" is whatever Microsoft officially calls the new Visual Studio (2007? 2008? something else?).</P>
<P>On the other hand, the <EM>CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</EM> has been reasonably successful in terms of selling enough to make it worth my time and effort. So writing a 3.0 Handbook is also a possibility.</P>
<P>I am in discussions with Apress about the one option, and am considering the other. But it will be some time before I make a final decision one way or the other.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
