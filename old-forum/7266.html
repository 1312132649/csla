I'm struggling with how to go about determining what properties were changed in my object after it has been saved. I really like the idea of having an "ifProjectClosed" check in my WF workflow but how would you implement such a check? In my case, I have an object that contains a "CoverageTerminated" date, but this object could have had a Term date set before it was saved...</P>
<P>My current plan is to have an extra&nbsp;"Coverage Terminated" date stored in the database--separate&nbsp;from the "Term" date visible in the UI--&nbsp;that only my workflow would use for the "If" check. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dlambert replied on Monday, July 13, 2009</h2>Have you looked at the INotifyPropertyChanged events?  This might help you determine which properties have changed.<br /><br />Reaction #2, though, is to step back and look at the scenario you're describing -- I'm sort of wondering if there shouldn't be an explicit "TerminateCoverage" command on your object that can focus the stuff you're talking about into a business method.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pondosinat replied on Monday, July 13, 2009</h2><P>Thanks, I did create a "TerminateCoverage"&nbsp;command&nbsp;initially but am thinking about other scenarios where employing If Else checks in a workflow as it&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;a powerful concept for handling complex workflow scenarious.</P>
<P>I discovered that I can leverage our db&nbsp;audit tables that are wired up to "update" triggers in order to grab&nbsp;whatever recently changed info we might need. For now, thought, more focused command objects&nbsp;as&nbsp;you&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;seem to be&nbsp;the right&nbsp;fit for this.</P>
<P>Thanks again.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
