I have to wonder is there a mirror object to ObjectAdapter? One that converts from the dataset to BO properties. I found SafeRowReader and it works great but&nbsp;you still have to load&nbsp;the properties yourself. Am I missing something obvious?</P>
<P>Also, is there a way for ObjectAdapter to not create columns for&nbsp;certain properties of the business object or better yet only copy the properties of the BO&nbsp;that have matching columns in the dataset?</P>
<P>I am a newbie to CSLA and am just starting to get a grasp of it, so forgive me if these seam like silly questions.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 29, 2007</h2><P>CSLA doesn't include anything to copy data from a DataTable into an object, no. I <EM>might</EM> do that in version 3.5, though my primary focus will be on providing richer copying from object-to-object for LINQ/EF support.</P>
<P>It has been a long time since I've done any work on the OA. However, if I remember correctly it will copy data into a pre-defined DataTable, and in that case will only copy the properties that correspond to the pre-defined columns.</P>
<P>Please remember that OA was created very specifically to enable a reporting scenario where the data from an object must be in a DataSet so it can be bound to something like a Crystal Report. Any other usage is beyond its purpose.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
