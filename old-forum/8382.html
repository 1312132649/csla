My name is Peer (jan Peter) van der Nagel (47) and since 2 months exploring the CSLA framework. I have quite a problem because I'm new to .Net, C# and CSLA.  The learning curve is still quite flat and all of this is quite a chalange for me.  My Goal is to make  buisiness applications (Silverlight) as I used to do with Visual Foxpro since 1990. This next months I'll be working on a test-learning project to get (hopefully) the skills to develop a full business application (redesign old VFP apps).<br /><br />I would realy appriciate some support (tips and tricks, step over pittfalls)  from a felow-developer in my lliving-area (Netherlands) <br /><br />Last november I downloaded the framework 3.8.0 (beta) and the video's (Silverlight) and started learning. Today I'v downloaded the 3.8.0 final release but when compilng the framework, Errors and warnings occured...<br /><br />1: the System.Web.Mvc assembly could not be found on my develop machine, so I checked MSDN  and found the MVCToolkit which I downloaded and copied in the dependencies folder. Now I could recreate a reference to MVcToolkit.dll and the reference problem was resolved. (I Think...)<br /><br />2: Errors->Error	14	The type or namespace name 'DefaultModelBinder' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)	G:\CSLA\Source\cslacs\Csla\Web\Mvc\CslaModelBinder.cs	12	34	Csla<br /><br /><br />3: 18 warnings popped up in the list-><br />Warning	2	#warning: 'We could send bag events here easily using a CircularQueue of (should?)'	G:\CSLA\Source\cslacs\Csla\C5\Hashing\HashBag.cs	389	10	Csla<br /><br />Questions<br />1: Is this the right way to install this version<br />2: should I install this version or should I wait until newer CSLA versions are ready or the VS2010 is available for me?<br /><br />Peer</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>am_fusion replied on Wednesday, January 20, 2010</h2><P>I am sure someone with more experience using MVC will probably pop in on this, but I believe the problem you are experiencing is that you do not have ASP.net MVC installed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The dependancy on the MVC install was removed in v 3.8.1 I believe:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>so you may want to just use that version.&nbsp; Though if this is a learning excersise I would go ahead and use the latest for whatever IDE\.net ver you are targeting (3.8.2 beta for .net 3.5 and vs2008.&nbsp; 4.0 for .net 4.0 and vs2010)</P>
<P>EDIT: as far as the warnings, Rocky or someone from his team would be able to speak to this more then me, but I believe these are internal warnings to aid in their development.&nbsp; We can safely ignore them.</P>
<P>FYI, here is the change log for 3.8.2 beta:</P>

I  read the changelog and will install the 3.8.1. to get rid of the dependecy to the MVC library.<br /><br />Is this a appropiate way/ forum the find some support, ask some questions ?   <br /><br />Peer</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>am_fusion replied on Thursday, January 21, 2010</h2><P>This forum is probably one of the better forums to ask these (and other) kinds of questions.&nbsp; The signal to noise ratio is very good and the people are very knowledgeable (beyond just CSLA implementation), friendly, and helpful (really a great community).<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>&nbsp;You may want to spend some time to check the FAQ:<o:p></o:p></P>
<P><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/</A><o:p></o:p></P>
<P>&nbsp;and do some forum searches before posting however.&nbsp; I find that many times someone else has already encountered the same problem I have and information already exists about it somewhere.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I have actually gotten in the habit of checking recent posts at least once a week which tends to keep me up on potential pit falls and&nbsp;gotchyas&nbsp;other people are having.&nbsp; Also, if you haven't already, Rocky's books and videos are great resources.<o:p></o:p></P>

(or can not be found ?) Anyway, there are so many things to keep in mind, adjust and search for problems. Its all in the game  and I'm determined to get in control of this.<br /><br />Peer</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
