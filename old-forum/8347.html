However, already on Demo001-project I run into problems.<br /><br />First, the projects have to be converted to VS2010. No problem, in general, but the service reference will not generate.<br /><br />This is how I fixed it: <br /><br />1. After reading some posts, I decided to change the service name. Appearently, there are some issuses with service names with with a dot (.). I change the namespace and name on service from "web.demoservice" to "webDemoservice". Rebuild the webproject.<br /><br />2. Delete the existing webservice reference and and a new - with a name you haven't tried before! AND..<br /><br />3. Make sure to uncheck "Reuse types in referenced asseblies"<br /><br />4. Change code to reflect the new proxy.<br /><br />..and it works!<br /><br /><br />Question: Why do I have to uncheck the "reuse types.." in service ref? In VS2008, with the same demo project, I don't need to do this!<br /><br /><br />t.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 13, 2010</h2><P>I've noticed this too. I think this has to do with some of the upcoming WCF RIA Services features, which do some assembly sharing between client and server. I also think that functionality is not complete in Beta 2 :)</P>
<P>But clearly Msft is doing some work in this space, and so the behavior of WCF references from SL to .NET has changed in VS10.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
