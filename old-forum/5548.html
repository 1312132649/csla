If so, you may want to implement that in your BO.&nbsp; If not... I'm not sure, it's never come up.&nbsp; <br><br>If you set it via the BO, you might need a BindingSourceRefersh component, otherwise your UI may not display the new value, due to how databinding works.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
