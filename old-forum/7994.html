<P>Time to get serious about this ... how about an update from you Rocky ??</P>
<P>Anyone else have their toes in the water ??</P>

<P>But given the shift in focus of what was "Oslo" toward being a SQL Server focused tool, and away from being a general purpose DSL/model generation tool, it is arguably less valuable or relevant to CSLA .NET than it was before.</P>
<P>In the original vision it was potentially very compelling because it was about creating languages that compiled metadata into a repository so you could build a dynamic runtime to execute the repository metadata. <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog">See my blog </A>for posts about MCsla and my research in that area.</P>
<P>That is all still possible with the latest CTP bits, and MCsla works with the latest stuff. It is a prototype or proof of concept, but it is interesting stuff.</P>
<P>However, if the SQL-focused direction means there's less focus on MGrammar and the concept of supporting dynamic runtimes (and that seems quite possible), then things like MCsla don't seem like such a nice fit any longer.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mondoh replied on Sunday, November 15, 2009</h2><P>Seems like the "re positioning" has more to do with:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Focusing the "product" on what MSFT strategists view as the "ripest" , broadest, audience for delivering something that can have a meaningful impact (a very agile step&nbsp;)<BR></LI>
<LI>Giving an established product group responsibility as the delivery channel ( square peg in round hole ???)&nbsp;</LI></UL>
<P>The following ... from the e-week story seems to indicate that there is MUCH more to come.</P>
<P>Moreover, Gall [the Gartner Analyst] said Microsoft has taken all of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and written transformation rules in the "M" grammar. "So now they can map any UML document into a SQL Server database. And you can do all sorts of <A class=iAs href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Microsofts-Oslo-Becomes-SQL-Server-Modeling-117207/?kc=EWKNLDAT11122009STR1#" target=_blank>analytics</A> on that," he said.</P>
<P>For his part, Gall said that in addition to Microsoft technologies such as SharePoint and others leveraging the Oslo, or SQL Server Modeling, technology, he sees opportunities for using the Oslo technology with the Microsoft ADO.NET Data Services technology, which was known by the&nbsp;code name "Astoria."</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mondoh replied on Thursday, December 10, 2009</h2><P>I ran into an application that uses the 12/05 version of the "DSL Toolkit" ..... is that worth looking into ??<BR><BR>I'm planning to take a deeper dive into OSLO and M to develop my DSL&nbsp;.... but am wondering if there is value in looking at "the toolkit"</P>

ANTLR creates lexers and parsers based on a grammar spec for many languages, including C#.  It also has a nice integration with a powerful template engine if you choose to use it.  You can pipe metadata from your AST directly into templates based on a tree grammar.  This is great for generating code.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
