<p>I added the ProjectTracker.Library.Wp to the solution&nbsp;but it won&#39;t compile.</p>
<p>Error: The type or namespace name &#39;Tasks&#39; does not exist in the namespace &#39;System.Threading&#39; (are you missing an assembly reference?)&nbsp;C:\Projects\NetProjects4.5\Framework\CSLA .NET\4.5.501\Samples\NET\cs\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Library\Security\PTIdentity.cs&nbsp;8&nbsp;24&nbsp;ProjectTracker.Library.Wp</p>
<p>and:&nbsp;The type or namespace name &#39;RunLocalAttribute&#39; could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)&nbsp;C:\Projects\NetProjects4.5\Framework\CSLA .NET\4.5.501\Samples\NET\cs\ProjectTracker\ProjectTracker.Library\ResourceEdit.cs&nbsp;174&nbsp;6&nbsp;ProjectTracker.Library.Wp</p>
<p>The csla reference is in the project. </p>
<p>The WP projects where not initialy in the solution when I opened up ProjectTracker. I am using Windows 8 with Visual Studio 2012. I have also installed the Windows Phone 8 SDK. Can&#39;t figure out what is missing.</p>

<p>See:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bcl.Async/">http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bcl.Async/</a>&nbsp;</p>

That helped the System.Threading problem.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>eloew replied on Thursday, February 20, 2014</h2><p>I notice that the wp sample included with Version 4.5.501 is os 7. Is there a WP8 sample for project tracker?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, February 25, 2014</h2><p>Sadly you are the first person to ask about Windows Phone development in (perhaps) forever. As a result, updating the WP samples has been near the bottom of our priorities, because nobody seemed to care much.</p>
<p>So thank you for being interested in WP development, that&#39;s encouraging!! In the next round of sample updates we&#39;ll probably make the WP samples a higher priority.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MackPoone replied on Wednesday, February 26, 2014</h2><p>Thanks.&nbsp; I too would like to see a Windows Phone 8 example.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>eloew replied on Wednesday, February 26, 2014</h2><p>Sounds great.

<p>Don&#39;t give up on WP!&nbsp; I have one (Lumia 920) and love it.&nbsp; I was thinking of doing a project in my own time and id start with web WP and Win8 store.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
