LoadProperty() doesn't mark the object dirty or raise the PropertyChanged event. So calling OnPropertyChanged() will notify data binding of the change to refresh the UI.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, September 24, 2008</h2>Great, thanks!&nbsp; Just wanted to know this was the proper way to go.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
