Those are IsChild and EditLevel property checks in particular.</p>
<p>It seems that the object could report that it&#39;s savable even though&nbsp;invoking Save on it will fail.</p>
<p>As far as IsChild goes, this can be pretty fine behavior if IsSavable&nbsp;indicates whether the object is savable directly or through its parent.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not quite sure that I see any benefits by omitting EditLevel check from IsSavable.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be nice to have centralized polimorphic property that indicates whether Save method can be invoked on the particular object.</p>
<p>Any background on this topic?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
