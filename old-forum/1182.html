<P>I am building a windows&nbsp;application use C#2.0 and CSLA.NET 2.0. The GUI contains a Treeview which denotes a "parents-&gt;children-&gt;grand children" relation. User can click tree node to open the corresponding editor to edit the child business object.&nbsp; In current design, when user switches to another tree node, the editor for the previous node only hides itself&nbsp;in the background.&nbsp;Opened child editors will not be closed until the main program exits.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>As my understanding, after calling the Save() method of root business object, I have to rebind all the opened child editors to the right children&nbsp;of returned root business object.&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>My question is:<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I can not think of a neat solution to track all the opened child editors and finding the right child object of returned root business object to do the rebinding for each opened child editor.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>What I can think of is that adding root business object as a property of child editor. But I donâ€™t think it is a good design for component reusing.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Would you guys give me some ideas? Thanks.<o:p></o:p></P>
