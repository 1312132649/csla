For instance, a fax number field <span style="text-decoration:underline;">isn&#39;t</span> required, but if it is populated it must have a minimum length of 10. But as it stands currently, the MinLength rule fails if it isn&#39;t populated. Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, March 22, 2013</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>A couple of possibilities:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>You could subclass the MinLength rule and add an extra condition befor calling base.Execute.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You could crete a Gateway rule to check for has value and then call the inner rule. This would work with any (sync) rule.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>For #2 look at the RuleTutorial sample for other gateway rules like CanWrite (only validate field if user is allowed to edit field).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
