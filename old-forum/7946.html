What did it set out to solve that the regular SL navigator didn't? If I understand correctly, it helps with bookmarks while maintaining the "State" that the objects are in for a given "page". </P>
<P>Does the Csla Navigator contain navigation for pages like the SL navigator does? (Like providing back button support)</P>
<P>Sorry to ask such a general question, but it's just been a little difficult to find a basic documentation on this.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 04, 2009</h2><P>I think you have the order of events backward :)</P>
<P>The CSLA Navigator component exists because Silverlight 2 didn't have anything at all.</P>
<P>Now that Silverlight 3 has a solution to the problem, you may very well choose to use the official solution.</P>
<P>But yes, the CSLA Navigator does back button integration and URL rewriting to support shortcuts - we solved the same problem in much the same way, but needed something several months before SL3 came out.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
