But i noticed that developers in my company are calling other business factory methods when they are at the server side (easy to know because we use the objectfactory's, in other words they call the factory methods from within a objectfactory)<br /><br />Since we only use the local dataportal proxy this works fine, but i'm wondering if this will work with remoting, enterprise services, wcf, etc..<br /><br />Even if this will work, is it correct to call other business factory methods?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 11, 2009</h2>Yes, it is fine to call the static factory methods while on the server - that's within the design parameters of the data portal and is an intended usage scenario.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Saturday, September 12, 2009</h2>Thanks for the good news.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Friday, September 11, 2009</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>rfcdejong:</strong></div><div>...Since we only use the local dataportal proxy this works fine, but i'm wondering if this will work with remoting, enterprise services, wct, etc..<br /><br />Even if this will work, is it correct to call other business factory methods?</div></BLOCKQUOTE><br /><br />I'll just wade in to offer that in every situation that we have used a remote or non-local data portal (mainly the web service portal, since it's especially debugger friendly), only the client side has used the remote portal. <br /><br />The "server side" is configured to use the local data portal anyway. (I suppose it might be possible to have an advanced configuration that might chain from one remote portal to another, but that makes my head hurt to think about)<br /><br />You incur a little more overhead going through the local portal server-side versus directly access to the object methods, but in general we've found all the CSLA calls that you would typically make client-side (e.g. Save(), __Fetch(), etc.) also work just fine server side.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
