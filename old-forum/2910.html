<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Hope everyone is well :)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Due to me changing jobs in the coming month I am unfortunately going to have next to no time to do anymore work in the wonderful world of CSLA.net.&nbsp; This is a very sad thing for me to realise but things are constantly changing and my new job isn't going to be as technical as my old one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In addition to my job change I have just had an obscenely large bill for the hosting of One Little Victory from my current host and so I am moving the website to a new URL.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It will be available at </FONT><A href="http://www.csladesktopref.com"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://www.csladesktopref.com</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma> from now on.&nbsp; The URL </FONT><A href="http://www.onelittlevictory.com"><FONT face=Tahoma>http://www.onelittlevictory.com</FONT></A><FONT face=Tahoma> will no longer work after I have cancelled my account with the "hosting thieves" LOL!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>I just wanted everyone to know that it had moved so that it can still be found.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>In closing I would expect this to be one of the last times that you all hear from me due to my new job and I'd just like to say what a pleasure it has been to meet you all and work with CSLA.net for the short period of time that I used it.&nbsp; The list of folk that have been supportive of my efforts is too long to list but you know who you are.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Good Luck to Rocky and all of you whatever you may do :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>It's been fun while it lasted.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Cheers</FONT></P>

<P>Thanks</P>

<P>I wish you the best in your new position!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ChrisD replied on Monday, May 21, 2007</h2><P>Thanks Rocky,</P>
<P>If I have time i'll certainly still be "fiddling" with CSLA.net as a hobby so you all may not have heard the last from me but it's looking as if my working hours will be filled with the wonderful world of Oracle e-Business Suite.</P>
<P>Take care</P>
<P>Chris</P>

<P>I've certainly enjoyed our work together, too.&nbsp; I hope the new job brings you all the rewards you're hoping for.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I'll bet we run into one another in a while... this darned industry moves pretty quickly, eh?</P>
<P>Thanks again,</P>
