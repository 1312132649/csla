I can only assume you are not receiving emails from <a href="mailto:cslastore@lhotka.net">cslastore@lhotka.net</a> for some reason? Have you checked your spam folders?</p>
<p>Your order was processed within one business day, and you should have recieved a series of emails related to the purchase, and then one later with your login credentials for download.lhotka.net (<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/StoreFaq.ashx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/StoreFaq.ashx</a>&nbsp;has useful information).</p>
<p>We did also manually reset your password and it was sent to you - I think that&#39;s been done twice now.</p>
<p>If you have none of those emails, please check your spam folders. If that fails, please send me an email directly at rocky at lhotka dot net and I&#39;ll forward the information to you from my email address - maybe that&#39;ll get through.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>j0552 replied on Tuesday, July 05, 2011</h2><p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you kindly. I have received your email with login details and downloaded the ebooks and samples. No sign of the original email in any spam folder but&nbsp;I&#39;ve got the books now&nbsp;and&nbsp;I&#39;m looking forward to a good read!</p>
<p>Thanks again<br />Andrew</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BigPines2 replied on Friday, July 06, 2012</h2><p>Rocky, I am having a very similar problem as the original poster. I ordered the CSLA 4 eBook package on 7/3 around 1:00 PM PST. I recieved a receipt from PayPal but nothing from your store. I was patient and waited until 7/5 to contact you at <a href="mailto:cslastore@lhotka.net">cslastore@lhotka.net</a>. It has now been an additional 24 hours +&nbsp;and I have not received a reply to that e-mail either. Perhaps your e-mail server is blacklisted? Unfortunately, I am in a corporate environment and I don&#39;t get to sort through my spam folder.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have a deadline creeping up on me to decide whether to use CSLA or not. I was supposed to put together a demo of CSLA 4 but I am finding that difficult without appropriate documentation. I have used older versions of CSLA and was excited to look at v4 but to be honest, this has been a very frustrating e-commerce experience and I am beginning to wonder if it is worth it.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me get the documentation I purchased.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Mike</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 06, 2012</h2><p>I apologize, we have had some email issues over the holiday weekend. You should have the download credentials now.</p>

<p>I got the e-mails and I am downloading the eBooks now. I look forward to exploring the new features.</p>
