<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, January 09, 2009</h2><P>We had to stop caching the proxy to allow for the async data portal behaviors. And this was wise anyway, I think, because I know some people were already using their own BackgroundWorker or other techniques to make multiple overlapping data portal calls, and that was just plain dangerous.</P>
<P>I don't think there's a real perf issue. If you look at nearly all service code out there (for WCF, asmx, Remoting, etc) you'll see that people create/release proxy objects all the time. No one thinks about caching these objects. It was a <EM>very</EM> minor optimization that now has a pretty significant downside because it blocks safe async implementations.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
