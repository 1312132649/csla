I feel this framework would be useful to a project I'm working but since I'm so new, I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction. Firstly, I'd like to know if I need IIS in order to use the remote storage options. Secondly, is there a quick example that I can check out to play with remote storage or client/server options?  Pardon my ignorance if I'm using the improper terminology. Thanks!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 08, 2009</h2><P>You can deploy your app in 1-, 2-, 3- and (with Silverlight) 4-tier physical configurations.</P>
<P>In a 2-tier model, the data is remote because the client uses the database communication model to talk to the database server.</P>
<P>In a 3-tier model, the client uses some network protocol/technology to talk to an application server. Usually this is WCF, but it can be Remoting, asmx web services or Enterprise Services (DCOM), or a custom channel.</P>
<P>Obviously in the 3-tier model <EM>something</EM> has to host the code on the app server. This is often IIS, but can be WAS or a custom Windows service.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
