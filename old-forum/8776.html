<p>I&#39;m having an issue with the PropertyStatus control in csla 3.8. The &#39;Property&#39; property is set to point to a property of my BO which is of type Nullable&lt;int&gt;. I have a validation rule that states that this property must not be null. The propertystatus doesn&#39;t display the error message, even though the property is null. In the BO&#39;s Dataportal_Create i execute&nbsp;ValidationRules.CheckRules() and I&#39;m able to breakpoint into the rule in question. If I change the rule to check for 1 instead of null, and load the property in DataPortal_Create with 1, the PropertyStatus works fine. So there seems to be an issue with a property set to null when created and the control not being updated.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
