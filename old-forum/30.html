<P>Ok, the good news is that I have added a link to the messages on my site that links back to the original MSN messages.</P>

<DIV>Bad news is, I have been getting my head around the 2.0 membership provider model.&nbsp; Early today I added an "applicationName" tag to the MembershipProvider section of the web.config file.&nbsp; Everyone who created accounts before I did this was associcated with the "default application".&nbsp; All those accounts were disassociated with the SearchCSLA site.&nbsp; I have since updated the records in the aspnet_membeship and aspnet_users for everyone and associated them with the SearchCSLA application.&nbsp; So you should be able to login with out any trouble.&nbsp; If not, please just create another account and you should be fine.&nbsp; Stephen this explains the trouble you had this morning.</DIV>

<DIV>Thanks.</DIV>
