When you double-click on an item within the editable grid, it opens a physician edit form which has an editable grid of credentials. I do this because there are certain fields of the physician that I want to be editable on the provider form, and certain fields I want to be editable individually by the physician edit form.</div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>That almost sounds like two different use cases to me.&nbsp; One use case allows quick editing of certain properties over a group of providers, the other allows full editing of a provider.&nbsp; Also, it would seem (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you would only be editing the credentials on the full edit screen.&nbsp; So your grid's BO doesn't need that collection at all.<br><br>I'd create another BO to handle the full edit case.&nbsp; When that form is saved, it could raise an event giving it the newly saved BO so that the BO linked to the grid can update itself.<br><br>Just my two cents.<br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
