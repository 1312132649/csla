<p>My Scenario:<br />a WPF MVVM Master/Detail App with two ViewModels, one for a ReadOnlyList To select an Item and one for a EditableRoot BO of the selected Item.<br />My Problem is, i want to get the Saved Event of the EditableRoot to Reload the ReadOnlyList in my Main ViewModel after Saving the EditableRoot.</p>
<p>I&#39;m Using CSLA 4.5. Thank you for an answer !</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t explicitly added INotifyPropertyChanged to your read-only class hierarchy you&#39;ll need to do that&nbsp;(I think we manually added it in our base classes as I think CSLA didn&#39;t - I could be wrong).</p>
<p>In your read-only child, just load the properties from the saved business object as you need to and invoke OnPropertyChanged so they refresh in the UI.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is probably what I would do... then you don&#39;t have to hit the server to get the changes you already have in memory from the saved editable root.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
