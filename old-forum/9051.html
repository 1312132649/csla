With my first few attempts, I have been&nbsp;&nbsp;changing the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig by mdifying from <a href="http://localhost/MyLocalSite/">http://localhost/MyLocalSite/</a> to the web address in four projects -&nbsp;(In addition to the Silverlight project I have three business libraries).&nbsp; After compiling, I copy all&nbsp;the contents of the local website, except for the connectionStrings.config file, to the server website.&nbsp; I saw a dns setting in the Web.config file, so I also change that.</p>
<p>The Silverlight app does load without any errors but none of the content from my three business libraries is showing up.&nbsp; In other words nothing that is used for Binding comes up.&nbsp; I know the connection strings and database connections&nbsp;are okay because, one I have to log in; and two, before loading the Silverlight module there is an Asp.Net&nbsp;page with a list of subjects that come from the DB&nbsp;ant that is displayed in a&nbsp;DataGrid&nbsp;just fine.</p>
<p>Staging Web Server&nbsp;is Server 2008.&nbsp; Has no FrontPage extensions. ( I would rather do without them since they have become an orphan child already).&nbsp; I wonder if we could have a one, two, three of instructions about what to do for this.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Additional Information:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like while from&nbsp;the Login page and Default.aspx, two different databases are accessed properly, the third database that is used exclusively by the Silverlight App is not being touched.&nbsp; The connection strings for all three databases have the same exact format except for the name of the DB, of course.&nbsp; On the development machine, there has never been a problem.</p>
<p>The trouble is, I don&#39;t know how I can go about debugging this issue.&nbsp; I would appreciate some suggestions.&nbsp; </p>
