<p>The Using CSLA 4.x objects ebook lumps together Editable Root and Child lists (in the title of the section on page 58) but in that section goes on to completely ignore editable <b>child </b>lists and provides no further info about the practical matter of coding them, instead it discusses in fairly good detail how to code an editable root collection that is directly persisted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#39;ll appreciate that later when I get to my editable root collections but for now I&#39;m in limbo.</p>
<p>I have a number of editable Root objects that contain a collection of child objects that I need to port over from csla 1.x and so far I&#39;m stumped as to best practices for this.</p>
<p>Are there any examples of how to do this?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 23, 2011</h2><p>The <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Access</em> ebook has a section in Chapter 5 titled &quot;Editable Object Graph Persistence&quot;. This is a walkthrough of a parent-childlist-child-grandchildlist-grandchild object graph.</p>
<p>That provides pretty detailed coverage of&nbsp;the editable child list stereotype.</p>
<p>Outside of persistence, there&#39;s no difference between a root or child editable list, and so the <em>Using CSLA 4: Creating Business Objects</em> ebook doesn&#39;t spend much time trying to differentiate. I left that to the <em>Data Access</em> ebook, where the differences are very real.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Wednesday, March 23, 2011</h2><p>Ok, thanks, I&#39;ll look at that again.&nbsp; I guess I&#39;m too literal, I think to myself there are these stereotypes and I look for a section on them and then expect an example of how to use each one.</p>
<p>Cheers and thanks again.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 23, 2011</h2><p>I tried to cover each stereotype.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s literally no difference between an editable root list and an editable child list outside the persistence code. I must confess that I thought about copy-pasting some of the content, but that really seemed inappropriate somehow :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
