<P>My employer is a specialist consultancy based in North West England&nbsp;and we are currently looking for a new developer to join our .Net team on a project building a Windows Forms application.</P>
<P>The project 'stack' is Oracle, Microsoft Enterprise Library, CSLA, Microsoft Composite Application Block/Smart Client Software Factory and the development is in C#, with MbUnit testing under CruiseControl.</P>
<P>Experience in CSLA and windows desktop development is essential, ideally you would have some experience in some of the other areas too, but we understand it's not a common setup so any mix is OK.</P>
<P>This is a small team so soft skills such as a willingness to learn, good communication skills and a flexible approach are as important as technical ones. </P>
<P>This company is part of a global organisation, but retains its autonomy and so can offer good career opportunities in a relaxed working environment with an excellent benefits package. </P>
<P>Couple of other points:</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can only accept candidates who already have permission to work in the United Kingdom.</LI>
<LI>This is a permanent, full-time position based at our office.</LI>
<LI>No agencies, please. </LI></UL>
<P>If you are interested in this position please send me a private message via this forum with details of your experience and availability.</P>
<P>Ta (as we say in this neck of the woods)</P>
<P>Richard</P>
