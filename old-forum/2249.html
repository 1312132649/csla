I added it to my base classes derived from RuleArgs and it makes writing "1 line rule args" a lot simpler. This is instead of creating the RuleArgs instance, and setting the severity and then using that in your rule.</P>
<P>Andy and I mentioned this enhancement Oct. 20, 2006. Wish it could have made it into 2.1.2 since it so easy to implement with no backward compatibility issues.</P>
