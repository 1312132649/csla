<P>Is there a trick to get the error provider to show when a child has a broken rule?</P>
<P>I have an editable root which contains an editable child, so there's only one binding source. I put an ErrorProvider on the form and set the DataSource to the same DataSource as the editable root.</P>
<P>The icon and tooltip work fine for any broken rules for the editable root, but none show up for the child.</P>
<P>Any info appreciated,</P>

Rocky has the example in the book on how to check both from the parent</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Thursday, June 22, 2006</h2><P>No, I haven't done that. I can't seem to find what you're talking about in the book, either. Do you mind letting me know where that is in the book?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
