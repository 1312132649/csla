It just seemed a little untidy because a series of ... if else ... statements always feels out of place in the OO world.<br><br>I can't seem to find it now but I think there was some discussion earlier about whether PropertyInfo should have its own PropertyChanged event. Rocky must have decided against it.<br><br>Ross<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, August 28, 2008</h2><P>I think I was in that discussion you're mentioning - even if PropertyInfo was passed instead of string, though, we'd still need the if/then statements... not sure how one might get around that one unless perhaps you used string constants when registering your properties - then you could use a case on the various constants. </P>
<P>6 on one, half a dozen.... </P>
