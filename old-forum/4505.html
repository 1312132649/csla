<P>Can you please tell me that status of CSLA .NET 3.5 and how soon you expect it to be out of beta?</P>
<P>Also, can you suggest a path for getting started with 3.5? Should we start with the Doing BO book from Apress and then supplement it with 2.1 and 3.0 eBooks?</P>
<P>I really want to get cranking on a new app using 3.5.</P>
<P>Thank you for your learned response and on-going contributions to the .NET developer community.</P>
<P>Respectully,</P>

So in 2-4 weeks basically. Several people/organizations on this forum are using Beta 2 and are providing some awesome feedback (thank you guys!!!), and I want to allow enough time for them (or you, if you'd like) to find any major issues so I can address them.</P>
<P>In terms of getting started, the "Expert 2008 Business Objects" book is scheduled for a September release - which is a ways out... But it takes a lot of time to write what I expect will be at least an 800 page book, maybe much bigger.</P>
<P>In the meantime this is the sequence:</P>
