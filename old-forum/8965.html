<p>I was under the impression that for CSLA.NET 4 a Criteria class was no longer needed. Re-reading &quot;CSLA 4 data portal changes&quot; on your blog you say &quot;It is now possible to use any serializable object as a criteria.&quot;</p>
<p>[pedantic mode on]</p>
<p>When you say &quot;a criteria&quot; it looks like you mean &quot;one criteria&quot;. But then again &quot;criteria&quot; is&nbsp;plural so one should say &quot;one criterion&quot; or &quot;a criterion&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[pedantic mode off]</p>
<p>Entering the no jokes mode, the point is: when do we need to use a Criteria class?</p>
<p>a) when we need to pass a non primitive type?</p>
<p>b) when we need to pass more than one type?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, May 22, 2010</h2><p>That is correct, you need a criteria class when</p>
<ol>
<li>you need to pass a non-primitive and otherwise non-serializable type</li>
<li>you need to pass more than one value</li>
</ol>
<p>I thought about extending the data portal calls to accept params arrays, like I do with the child data portal. But there are problems with using params that many people have encountered with the child data portal, and I don&#39;t know how to solve them. The problems are edge cases, but they do occur, and I decided I didn&#39;t want to introduce that issue to the top-level data portal without a solution.</p>
<p>So you can pass any one serializable or primitive value as criteria in CSLA 4. Of course your serializable value can be a custom criteria (or any other business type), so the flexibility is very high.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pecen replied on Friday, December 28, 2012</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Picking up on this thread and hope you could clarify one thing. </p>
<p>You say that you need a criteria class when: &quot;1. You need to pass a non-primitive type&quot;. Is that true for strings as well, since strings are not a primitive type. </p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p><i><b>&quot;you need to pass a non-primitive and otherwise non-serializable type&quot;</b></i></p>
<p>For CSLA 4.x you should regard SingleCriteria as obsolete - you normally only need a criteria object when </p>
<ul>
<li>there is more than one value or</li>
<li>the value/criteria is not serializable by the MobileFormatter </li>
</ul></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
