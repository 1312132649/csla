<p>E.g. in ProjectTracker there is the BO ResourceAssignment.&nbsp; It has a Role property.&nbsp; If a ResourceAssignment record is created with Role=0, then the BO for Role should not be able to delete Role=0 since it is in use.</p>
<p>How do you guys handle this?&nbsp; Do you try and delete and then catch the&nbsp;database error that will occur and then display a message?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
