It appears that they show up in your Inbox (link to this is near login info). Shouldn't there be some setting that would allow auto subscription to these sort of messages? Otherwise, how would people know to go look for them?<br><br>Tom<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 11, 2006</h2><P>I don't know. I do know that I get emails any time someone sends me a private message. Exactly why, I'm not sure - it must be something with how I've enabled email support through my profile.</P>
<P>What I don't like is that the person's contact info isn't in the email - so the only way I can reply is to physically visit the forum site and reply though the forum software. Which is fine I guess, but isn't as easy as just hitting reply in email...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Friday, July 14, 2006</h2><P>I have also received email notification of private messages.&nbsp; I don't remember setting up anything special to get this functionality, so it must be the default way it works.</P>
<P>I agree, it is a pain to have to visit your "private message" inbox on the forum in order to answer the query.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
