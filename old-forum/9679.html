<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, October 26, 2010</h2><p>The way you are <i>supposed </i>to do 
this is to bind the UI control&#39;s SelectedItem property to a 
property of the viewmodel. Which is fine for a lot of controls, but some
 controls don&#39;t have a SelectedItem property you can bind to the 
viewmodel...</p>
<p>That is exactly why MethodParameter exists - as a workaround for poorly designed UI controls (at least from an MVVM perspective).</p>
<p>Moreover, because some controls have &quot;stubborn&quot; properties (like the Silverlight ListBox.SelectedItems) that don&#39;t bind correctly, You can tell TriggerAction to rebind MethodParameter <i>immediately before invoking the method</i>, so you can actually bind to those properties. Usually that&#39;s not necessary, but it does happen...</p>

Your previous&nbsp;post on the subject&nbsp;lead me to wonder if&nbsp;I&#39;d&nbsp;missed something significant for such situations.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
