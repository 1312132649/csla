That'd mean maintaining two more versions of the framework, probably along with two more reference apps. I'm not sure there are enough mobile developers to buy enough books to make it worth that effort (though I could be wrong on that assumption).</P>
<P>I say two versions, because of VB/C# - but also because the CF environment is different enough from real .NET that there'd be substantial differences. At least in terms of what's not there. Things like the data portal have no meaning in a CF world, and n-level undo requiring serialization becomes impossible - at least in a way comparable to CSLA today.</P>
<P>The real driver though, is whether there are enough book-buying mobile developers for it to make sense. Unless I change my approach, that's the only way I recoup anything for the time and effort I put into CSLA - and book sales are not all that great for regular .NET books. (I think the Internet is slowly killing the printed page, at least for tech content)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, January 12, 2007</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/basicblue/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>book sales are not all that great for regular .NET books.
