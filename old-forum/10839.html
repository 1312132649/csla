Bascially I&#39;d like one VM that refers to another to know when the latter is ready.</p>
<p>I have a PropertyChanged and ErrorOccurred event but no specific &quot;I&#39;m ready&quot; type event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jh72i replied on Thursday, November 03, 2011</h2><p>I&#39;m thinking PropertyChanged wouldn&#39;t be a good idea generally because, for example, the VM in question could be <em>busy</em> for any number of reasons. What I&#39;ll likely do is inherit VMBase and implement my ow set of methods and events that I find useful for my apps. It&#39;ll likely closely mirror what I already do in base presentation classes in winforms<em>.</em></p>
<p>Just curious to know if I&#39;m not missing something about the mvvm pattern that I&#39;ll only <em>get</em> when it&#39;s too late.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, November 07, 2011</h2><p>You can certainly add your own even when you create your viewmodel base class that inherits from ViewModelBase.</p>
<p>The reason there isn&#39;t an event like that is because the most common usage scenario is the sort of thing you are talking about, and if one is not extremely careful you&#39;ll end up with circular references and memory leaks. Remember that handling an event means the event source now has a reference to the object containing the event handler method.</p>
<p>What&#39;s really needed to solve this sort of issue is a pub/sub technology that uses weak references. The major MVVM UI frameworks have event/message routers built into them for this purpose.</p>
<p>The ViewModelBase class intentionally limits the number of public members, with the assumption that you will create a viewmodel base class of your own (by subclassing ViewModelBase) that fits smoothly into the UI framework you adopt.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jh72i replied on Wednesday, November 09, 2011</h2><p>Thank you for this reply. It is extremely useful to me in terms of injecting caution where i hadn&#39;t considered there to be a problem. Once its spelt out it, of course, makes perfect sense.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
