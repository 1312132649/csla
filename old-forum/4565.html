<P>Rocky... If you read this, are you familiar with this group?&nbsp; If not, do you have&nbsp; recommendation for someone to get some training?</P>
<P>P.S - I know the book is a great resource... I've read through it... I was just looking for more resources.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2><P><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/ct.ashx?id=1bb477b0-0c48-46db-b0de-611af33a262c&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dunntraining.com%2ftraining%2fschedule.htm">Dunn Training</A> is the official traning company for CSLA. They licensed the rights to do the training from me, and I think they do a very good job.</P>
<P>The current class is three days of mostly hands-on work, assuming no knowledge of CSLA and walking through all the main concepts and coding practices.</P>
<P>They are putting together a more advanced five day "master class" that'll be offered later this year (just twice a year I think). That class will have more lecture, but still some hands-on lab time, and it'll be pretty intense because they plan to cover CSLA, all the data options and all the interface options (Windows, web, WPF, WF, WCF, etc).</P>
<P>While I think the book and ebooks&nbsp;are great resources, training is very valuable as well.</P>
<P>And for longer term mentoring, as well as architecture, design and development assistance I obviously strongly recommend <A href="http://www.magenic.com">Magenic</A>. Magenic effectively sponsors CSLA .NET by employing me and giving me the time to do what I do. And working at Magenic means I get to work with a lot of very smart and enthusiastic people - and I love that!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MGervais replied on Tuesday, April 01, 2008</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Rocky,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>We will have 4 developers taking part in the Toronto CSLA Class, provided it runs, but I am thinking that having a CSLA Consultant come on board for a period to assist us in getting the ball rolling so to speak would be largely beneficial.</FONT></P>

<P>Just FYI... I'm trying to get approved to go to the Toronto Dunn Training course so hopefully that will help make sure they have it.</P>
<P>I should find out by next week. :)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
