<p class="MsoNormal">Hello,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just out of curiosity, I was wondering if anyone could let
me know the reason why there is no formal CSLA way to enforce authorization
rules when adding, replacing or removing items from a collection.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I really wish the CSLA had a built in way (well know way) to
be able to enforce such actions. Note that I am not just taking about simple &quot;is in role&quot;&nbsp;authorization&nbsp;rules but more sophisticated rules that includes authorization based on a value on a parent object
for example or some other criteria.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In essence, I wish we could attach a rule to an add,
replace, remove collection action (just like we do for properties) and have the
CSLA take it from there. As of now, I only know of workarounds that requires us
to manually enforce such rules on our business objects.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you.</p>
