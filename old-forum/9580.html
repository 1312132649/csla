<p>I have seen a couple of posts on getting CSLA to work on WP7 and how one could modify CSLA Light to get it to work. Just wanted to know if there is a version out there (even an early drop) or any news on the progress.</p>
<p>Cheers</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, September 27, 2010</h2><p>For the most part, yes. The 4.0.1 release has some early bits that mostly work, and there is some slightly later code in svn of course.</p>
<p>The roadblock I ran into was with some bugs in the beta tooling that made it impossible to run all the unit tests without crashing VS. Then I went to Germany (just got back about an hour ago), so the last couple weeks have been really hectic&nbsp;and I didn&#39;t dare install new software on my computer right before a trip like that - so I haven&#39;t been able to see if the RTW tools help solve the problem.</p>
<p>In any case, the vast majority of unit tests pass,and I&#39;ve built some sample apps to test things out - all is well.</p>
<p>What is not done at all, is a Csla.Xaml.dll for WP7. Well, I think I have ViewModel&lt;T&gt; in there, but no controls. I am not sure what, if any, controls actually make sense. Busy status doesn&#39;t - there&#39;s already something in the phone for that. PropertyStatus doesn&#39;t translate directly - though I do think <em>something</em> is necessary along that line.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, September 29, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;m firming up plans around WP7, and thought this was a good place to relate them.</p>
<p>The next release of CSLA 4 will be version 4.1. This release will primarily focus on providing WP7 support, though there are various other enhancements/bug fixes as well.</p>
<p>I hope to start the beta of 4.1 in mid-October. There are two primary issues I&#39;m working on first:</p>
<ol>
<li>There&#39;s a unit test that crashes the VS debugger (and all of VS) entirely - which we think is a bug in VS - but we&#39;re working with Microsoft to try and identify the issue</li>
<li>I need to figure out a &quot;PropertyStatus equivalent&quot; for WP7 - the existing PropertyStatus doesn&#39;t fit into the UI metaphor for WP7, but the concept is absolutely critical</li>
</ol>

<p>I have not done any Silverlight development so am struggling a bit with the concept of setting up a project. I tried to get the Inventory sample libraries (Invlib.Client) to be referenced from a WP test project. Adding a direct reference will not work (since it is a SL project) so I have crated a copy in a WP Class Library. </p>
<p>At the moment I have difficulties hitting the end point specified in ServiceReferences.ClientConfig (nothing actually happens and the DP methods are never hit). Is the setup still the same like in SL or will it have to be different? Im confused as I&#39;m not sure how it will be possible to setup an &quot;internal&quot; endpoint within WP (ok in dev mode but how will that be deployed?).</p>
