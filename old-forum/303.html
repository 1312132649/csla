<P>That doesn't seem to model the business correctly.&nbsp; Suppose I have a ShoppingCartItem class with Quantity field.&nbsp; Quantity should be an int when used by the system.&nbsp; </P>
<P>How is this typically done w/ CSLA?</P>

<P>Nullable&lt;int&gt; is good for missing data.&nbsp; But, what if the user types letters in a field that is to be numeric.&nbsp; It would have to be stored as a string in the object, if I understand correctly and the object holds all the data.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Am I correct in thinking that the object always holds a copy of the data in the form?</P>
<P>I guess I should clarify we're only doing webforms right now.</P>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>You could create
a textbox that accepts only integers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You could also use an adapter to wrap your object.<span>&nbsp; </span>The adapter would contain all string properties
for the object that it wraps.</span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>chrisb replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2><P>Ok, the adapter sounds good.</P>
<P>Thanks for the help.</P>
