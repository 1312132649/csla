<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Can anyone tell me how to set up the PTWcfClient and PTWcfService. I've done the following</P>
<P>1. I've downloaded CSLA 3.0.4 and unzipped the files. </P>
<P>2. I then added PTWcfClient and PTWcfService to the ProjectTracker solution. </P>
<P>3. Rebuilt the solution&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>If I try and update the reference (PTWcfService) under the references section of PTWcfClient I keep getting error messages saying "unable to connect to remote server. Metadata contains a refernce that cannnot be resolved." etc.</P>
<P>I've also tried adding the folder www\PTWcfService to my c:\inetpub\wwwroot which&nbsp;then appears&nbsp;in IIS. Should&nbsp;I be able to browse to the .SVC file.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm lost, does anybody know what&nbsp;steps I need to take to run the ProjectTracter Wcf sample (I'm not interested in the WcfPortal just the&nbsp;WCF client and service example). </P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
<P>Simon</P>

<P>That demo is potentially quite complex. If you read the WCF chapter in the <EM>Using CSLA .NET 3.0</EM> ebook you'll see that this app can be configured to use no security all the way through passing an encrypted username/password pair over the network for authentication. The simple model is pretty easy, but the encrypted authentication gets really complicated very rapidly.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
