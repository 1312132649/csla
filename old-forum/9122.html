<p>I have been developing an app using CSLA 3.6.2 for SL. Im now trying to improve the user interface and planning to use a third party suite for that purpose.</p>
<p>If possible, i will appeciate any feedback of people using any of them, say component one, telerik or any other.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t intend here to be this a commercial focused post, just feedback of practical experience with any third party suite.</p>
<p>One of my interests is the datagrid (mainly for the filters and exporting), would like to know if they work well with the framework and because i haven&#39;t migrated to CSLA 4 i also dont know if validation in cells of them will be compatible with the new csla validation model.</p>
<p>Any feedback will be appreciated :)</p>
