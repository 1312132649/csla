<p>Despite the difficulty, I&#39;m already in love with the technology.&nbsp; The ability to deliver rich applications over the internet while avoiding the morass that is HTML is a big win for this developer.&nbsp; I hate HTML with the heat of a thousand suns.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought a new age had dawned with XHTML but that standard was abandoned before it got off the ground.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think HTML 5 will fix any of the issues we&#39;ve been complaining about for years (compatibility between browsers) because too many cooks ruin the soup.&nbsp; New controls?&nbsp; Richer Internet? Sure thing - but with all of the same headaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s be honest, serious attempts at constructing a standard don&#39;t take until 2020 to finalize.&nbsp; Learn to recognize committees composed of navel gazers overcome with their own superiority and move on already.&nbsp; If people were serious about compatibility between browsers we would have had the problem licked 10 years ago.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I do get some blowback at my place of employment over the idea of downloading the Silverlight plugin.&nbsp; I don&#39;t say much about it but I do laugh inside.&nbsp; It&#39;s from Microsoft haters that think nothing about writing applications that require the JVM, Flash, PDF Reader, or a host of other plugins.&nbsp; Given the choice between constant page postbacks and single 2 min install I&#39;d take the 2 min install any day of the week.&nbsp; Too many people forget that Silverlight can replace a desktop application which would have to be distributed in some form or another.&nbsp; At the very least a web based application requires a browser - who uses the web without some custom installations?&nbsp; Seriously.</p>
<p>The ASP/AJAX paradigm has always struck me as a really big hack.&nbsp; I appreciate the fact that you can create a beautiful website with this approach but I&#39;d hate to have to maintain it through browser versions, HMTL changes, and Javascript evolution.&nbsp; It&#39;s okay if you love it - it&#39;s always looked like bailing wire/chewing gum/duct tape approach to me.</p>
<p>Anyways&nbsp;back to the topic at hand:&nbsp;The BXF isn&#39;t going to save me time if I don&#39;t understand what it accomplishes for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will give me a good start on a new project&nbsp;but as soon as something is required which requires a quick detour off the beaten path I&#39;ll be totally lost.&nbsp; Worse, without understanding what is going on behind the scenes I&#39;m likely to architect a hack that will only make things very ugly.&nbsp; I&#39;ve done this before in Windows Forms code and as I look back over the messes I&#39;ve created it makes me die a little bit inside.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frameworks are no substitute for understanding.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve said all of that to get to my question.</p>
<p>I&#39;m working on understanding Silverlight in relation to CSLA/BXF/MVVM.&nbsp; What I&#39;m doing is attempting to write small test applications without using MVVM/BXF so that I can get an idea as to what problems these technologies solve.&nbsp; For example, I&#39;m spending a couple of days playing around with Commands by first writing a Command from scratch, then writing a base class from which all my Commands may be derived and then examining it in the BXF Framework.&nbsp; I&#39;ve done similar things with Dependency Properties and Binding.</p>
<p>In regard to Silverlight, what other &#39;raw knowledge&#39; would you suggest before moving onto understanding a MVVM framework such as BXF?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Recommendation: I&#39;m finding Silverlight 4 In Action by Pete Brown to be a fantastic resource.&nbsp; I&#39;d recommend it to any Silverlight 4 noobs. :D</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jaans replied on Sunday, December 19, 2010</h2><p>I agree, the whole new WPF/Silverlight paradigm was a big shift but one I&#39;m now with hind sight, happy to have worked through. It is just soo much better!!</p>
<p>I have found Adam Nathan&#39;s book &quot;WPF Unleashed&quot; (Sams Publishing) exceedingly valuable. Admittedly it&#39;s a bit dated and not focussed on Silverlight, but I give me an under-the-hood understanding of XAML (which is more important to &quot;Get it&quot; than the technology to which it&#39;s applied). I see it as a fundamentals book. <br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Presentation-Foundation-Unleashed-WPF/dp/0672328917">http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Presentation-Foundation-Unleashed-WPF/dp/0672328917</a></p>
<p>It explains soo much of what happens magically without people knowing about it, and it essential when things go wrong.</p>
<p>I think you are right to get WPF/Silverlight and it&#39;s associated technologies under the belt, before looking at UI Frameworks/Design patterns like MVVM, but that&#39;s me. </p>
<p>Good luck and hang in there,<br />Jaans</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mehgerbil replied on Tuesday, December 21, 2010</h2><p>I have the book you recommend.&nbsp; It has one of the better explanations of dependency properties I&#39;ve read.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jaans replied on Wednesday, December 22, 2010</h2><p>This recent blog post summarising free WPF learning resources might also be very helpful!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been wanting some material that explains the why behind some of the decisions.&nbsp; It&#39;s much easier to understand code when I know the why beind some of the decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
