<P>This would be ok, except we are restricted from access to the C:\ drive on our deployment servers.&nbsp; The actual assemblies reside on D:\.&nbsp; We would prefer to store the config file with the assemblies.&nbsp; We have not been able to figure out the name or location to accomplish this.&nbsp; We tried putting a config file named &lt;assemblyname&gt;.dll.config in the same directory as the assembly, but it was not recognized.</P>
<P>Is there any way to do this without modifying the CSLA code?&nbsp; We have ASP.NET clients accessing the components as well.</P>
