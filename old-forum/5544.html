When a value type property (like SmartDate or int) is replaced by another value, SetProperty and LoadProperty should carry any metadata from the previous value forward. That should include the FormatString. Is this not what you are seeing?</P>
<P>2. Yes, you can create a custom business rule (a "validation" rule that always returns true) to modify the property value.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dagware replied on Wednesday, October 15, 2008</h2>Sorry I didn't respond sooner.
