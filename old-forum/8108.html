What&nbsp;I need is a validation rule that informs the user that&nbsp;3b is not a part of 2a. &nbsp;I know it isn't an ideal solution to use xl as user input but can I do this in CSLA?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2><P>Probably what i would do is have some BO classes which represent the heirarchy.&nbsp; The root instance would be created using the xls file as input (which ends up going through the normal DP_C).&nbsp; The the validation rules could check everything is ok or not.&nbsp; What you do with the graph at that point depends on your use case.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
