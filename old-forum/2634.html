<P>I justed to see what the consensus was for creating flowcharts&nbsp;of my code. The application is becoming more complex and I need to create flowcharts to keep track of things. So I was wondering how people have handled this in the past. Also if there's some good books I can use as reference to get consistancy. (its been a while since I've looked </P>
<P>Thanks for any suggestions made.</P>
