<P>Also, putting the BO Library source code in the same solution can cause difficulties.&nbsp; It has to do with some truly bizarre practices by the VS 2005 web team and shadow directories.&nbsp; You might notice the problem when you add classes to the BO Library after you've already compiled and run the web site.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are various threads touching on how to get around this when it happens.&nbsp; I usually am just really careful to build all the objects that I'm going to need first. :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Diz replied on Wednesday, December 13, 2006</h2>Thanks for your input David.&nbsp; <br><br>I've narrowed this down to the fact that the files are sitting on a network share.&nbsp; We use Clear Case here, and it's all in a Dynamic View.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I copy the solution to a local drive and fire it up, it runs fine.&nbsp; Same code on a network share fails.&nbsp; <br><br>.net has been configured for full trust on the intranet zone.&nbsp; <br><br>So it's not a CSLA thing, anyway, it seems. <br>Thanks again!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Sunday, December 24, 2006</h2><P>Have you tired&nbsp;signing your assemblies?</P>
<P>Programs that run on the CLR use something called code access security (CAS). CAS is different from traditional security systems in that it assigns trust to code rather than users. To do this, the security system gathers a set of evidence about every assembly it loads. This evidence is then compared against the security policy, and a permission grant is generated.<BR><BR>One of the pieces of evidence that the security system gathers is the security zone that the code is running from. When you run the code from your local machine, this will be the MyComputer zone, but when you run it off of a server, or even a network share mapped to a drive on your machine, it will be the LocalIntranet zone.<BR><BR>By default any code that is run from the MyComputer zone will get a permission set of FullTrust (unrestricted permission to do anything it pleases). However, by default, there is a more restrictive permission set given to LocalIntranet assemblies.<BR><BR>The way to make an application that works from the MyComputer zone work from the LocalIntranet zone is to give the assemblies in your application a strong name, and modify the security policy to trust this strong name. Hence the need for a key.<BR><BR>Hope this helps</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jspurlin replied on Sunday, December 24, 2006</h2>Do you have this in your web config?<br><br>&lt;pages pageBaseType="BasePage"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;controls&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&lt;add tagPrefix="csla" namespace="Csla.Web" assembly="Csla"/&gt;</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/controls&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;namespaces&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;clear/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;add namespace="System"/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;add namespace="YourAssembly.Namespaces"<br><br>It is a great way to tell ASP.NET to look for controls and import namespaces at the page level.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jurjen replied on Sunday, December 24, 2006</h2><P>Hi Diz,</P>

<P>I reference my assemblies over a network share, I've done this in various projects and it has always worked well for me. Can't say why it doesn't work now (I've added a Csla tab to the toolbox and added the DataSource control to it and now I can add it. But adding it by type &lt;csla:data... doesn't get recognized.</P>
