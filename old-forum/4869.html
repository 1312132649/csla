I implemented the update method as internal for this child colletion which in turn calls&nbsp;internal methods for&nbsp;insert, delete or update of its editable child depending upon the flag values. Now my question is do i have to call MarkClean() or MarkOld() method explicitly in update method for this editable child?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Lalit replied on Tuesday, May 20, 2008</h2>The version i am using is CSLA.net 3.0</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, May 20, 2008</h2>It depends on the operation.&nbsp; For insert or update, MarkOld should be called.&nbsp; The that will mark the object as both clean and old.. old meaning it exists in the database.<br><br>For delete, MarkNew should be called.&nbsp; It sets the instance as dirty and new, or not existing in the database.&nbsp; Since clean tells you if the object has changed since it was loaded from the db and the instance doesn't exist in the db, it's by definition dirty.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
