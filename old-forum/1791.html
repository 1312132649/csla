<P>I am looking for developers with experience in CSLA for a position in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands (just south of Cuba and west of Jamaica).&nbsp; We also have offices in Toronto Canada and remote working is a possibility, though at least a temporary relocation to Grand Cayman would be preferable.</P>
<P>We have some current hedge fund software and are looking to undertake a fairly major new piece of functionality (portfolio managemnt system) and are looking for additional developers skilled in CSLA to help with this project.&nbsp; We are looking for both junior and senior positions potentially.</P>
<P>We currently use CSLA, VS 2005 (C#), Windows forms, SQL 2005, Infragistics controls, SQL Reporting Services, and Sharepoint Services.</P>
<P>If you may be interested, please post here or contact me at <A href="mailto:tony.campney@NOSPAMharmonic.ky">tony.campney@NOSPAMharmonic.ky</A>&nbsp;(without the NOSPAM part).</P>
<P>Cheers!</P>
