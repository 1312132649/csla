<p>I want edit childs is this way:</p>
<p>1) if I have seleced a single child, it is display in a &nbsp;details mask for editing the properties.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;if I selected more than a child I wan&#39;t to edit all childs, in the same mask edit (like a property grid that combine same properties for assign objects).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Which is the better solution? I wan&#39;t to see anything changes in list until &nbsp;modified childs is saved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must use a Read only list and a Editable root at same time?</p>
<p>Any suggestions is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

In other words, your existing business object model doesn&#39;t need to be altered. What you need is a viewmodel that manages the interaction between the one UI control (your textbox) and the set of selected items in the collection.

I&#39;ve done this for a client or two over the years, and it is not a terribly hard problem to solve as long as you recognize the need for a UI-specific viewmodel object that handles this particular type of interaction.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>caste replied on Tuesday, January 15, 2013</h2><p>Hi Rocky, you are right, this is a presentation level issue. I have implemented a VM, that manages the list of business objects.</p>
<p>Thanks for your replay.</p>
