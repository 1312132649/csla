<P>Is there a way to use CSLA rules with the new validations controls?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, April 16, 2009</h2><P>It is my understanding that their current strategy is exception-based. Which is really sad and limiting.</P>
<P>The "solution" is for SetProperty() to throw an exception if a rule is broken. But of course you can't provide very much meaningful data through an exception, so it is unlikely that more than one broken rule could be displayed, even if several are broken. And the concept of severities wouldn't work.</P>
<P>This is not to say that we won't provide a config switch so you can put CSLA into "dumbed-down exception mode" if you want to use the built-in stuff - but personally I suspect I'll keep using PropertyStatus because it is so much more powerful.</P>
<P>The reality is that even in WPF, which has a far more powerful model, I <EM>still</EM> use PropertyStatus because it is so much more powerful...</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
