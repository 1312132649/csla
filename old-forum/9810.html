<p>I have a project that requires me to integrate data from three&nbsp;separate databases. Two&nbsp;are SQL Server while the third is DB2.&nbsp; The DB2 database is closed to changes as it houses the company&#39;s financial data from their ERP system.&nbsp; I cannot add tables, views, etc. - I have to use it as-is.&nbsp; One of the SQL Server databases contains metadata that is used to help work with the data in the DB2 database.&nbsp; The other hold application-specific data used by the client app.</p>
<p>I am using LINQ-to-SQL to access the SQL Server databases and standard ADO.NET for DB2.&nbsp; There is no LINQ-to-DB2 that I know of and the company (despite my urging) is not willing to use Entity Framework because they have several outdated developers who can&#39;t support the app if we jump into EF. (I know!)</p>
<p>Oh, and we are following an SOA approach with an ASP.NET web-client front-end running on a web server, a WCF service application running on an app server behind the firewall and the databases running on their own servers internally.&nbsp; The WCF service app is a standalone application and not the data portal as we envision having multiple clients using the service in the future and the company doesn&#39;t want to lock the service interface into CSLA.</p>
<p>The problem at-hand is a call from the web application into the service application that requires data from more than one database.&nbsp; In the service application, I need to query a table in the SQL Server metadata database then use that information to query records in the DB2 database.</p>
<p>Long story short, I have a set of rules that determine what fiscal periods may be edited based on today&#39;s date.&nbsp; The list of rules for each fiscal period is contained in a SQL Server database.&nbsp; I&nbsp;apply those&nbsp;rules&nbsp;as part of the filter criteria when I query the DB2 database for financial information.&nbsp; The work is currently done by my service class by creating a new FiscalPeriodRuleList business object which hits the appropriate SQL Server database and&nbsp;retrieves the business rules.&nbsp; Once I have this, I&#39;m kinda stumped as the best approach to obtain the final result which is a list of financial statements from the DB2 database.&nbsp; Right now I have another business object, Financials, that I am passing the FiscalPeriodRuleList to in the factory method and it generates the necessary query code.</p>
<p>I can provide more details as needed but any insights or suggestions are appreciated.</p>
