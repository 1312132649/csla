endpoint address but they were quite old and didn't seem to quite
answer my question.<br><br>What I want to do is in the
Application_Startup method of a Browser hosted Silverlight app; configure the
endpoint address to match that of the hosting server's hostname.&nbsp; I was
wondering if this was directly possible through some properties in
CSLA?&nbsp; Creating a new proxy class seems like overkill for something
that has to be really common.&nbsp; I would think that most SL apps would
want to communicate back to the same server they are hosted on.<br><br>Thanks</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DancesWithBamboo replied on Wednesday, November 11, 2009</h2>Oh bother.&nbsp; I didn't realize that subclassing WCFProxy and setting DataPortalUrl in it would take all of 2 minutes.<br><br>Nevermind.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
