<P>That's my old site that you are referring to in your post.&nbsp; I haven't got around to doing a tutorial on ActiveObjects and unfortunately it will not be for some time if I do as I have the VB portion of my new site to put in place first.</P>
<P>Given time I may get there but don't expect it to be in the next month or so as I am on holiday for 2 weeks this month and i'll be writing the VB pages after that.</P>
<P>Maybe once that is done i'll get there.</P>
<P>The pages on my old site are actually inaccurate now but I can email you their content when I get home if that would help you?</P>
<P>Let me know</P>
<P>Cheers</P>

<P>Are there any Tutorials for ActiveObjects 2.0 Petar has nothing posted yet and it would be a great help. If nothing else will have to drudge thru it...</P>
<P>Regards,</P>
