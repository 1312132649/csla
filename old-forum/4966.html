<P>I am a firm believer in Rocky's CSLA methodology and would like something that can generate "pretty" web pages without me learning all the ASP.NET stuff and digging into AJAX, etc.&nbsp; I am going to check out CodeBreeze now and Code Complete as the CodeBreeze demo on the web had CSLA in their example, so I will have to see if it utilized the CSLA architecture for it's data access and business logic.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance for your help and recomendations.</P>
