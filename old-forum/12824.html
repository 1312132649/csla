I spent time add the missing references. The app didn&#39;t compile and I found out that it depends on version &nbsp;1.0 of Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework.dll. The User and Role classes were removed from version 2.1 which is the latest stable version as of now.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 11, 2015</h2><p>You can add this as an issue in GitHub, and if you have the time to resolve it you can submit a pull request - thank you!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
