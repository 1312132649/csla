This can be particularly tricky if you are using reference paths as tracking down which DLL the IDE is trying to use can be&nbsp;a chore. I recommend doing a Clean on your project. Alternatively, you can try deleting all files from the bin directory and rebuilding. Sometimes, a good old-fashioned reboot does the trick ;-)</P>
