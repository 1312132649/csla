I would be interested to hear from others.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Kevin Fairclough replied on Tuesday, December 09, 2008</h2>Another way to do this would be to map it as a component as shown <a href="http://colinjack.blogspot.com/2008/09/nhibernate-mapping-custom-collections.html">here</a>.&nbsp; This however requires access to a internal list.&nbsp; Does CSLA have such an internal list? or can I get at it via .NET, what I need is an IList that I can map to.<br><br>TIA<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
