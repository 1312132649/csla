<p>It takes nearly 900ms to post WcfPortal.svc when Silverlight app first time laoded, is that normal? or i did something not correct?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 09, 2011</h2><p>That is hard to answer, because there are many things that could be happening.</p>
<p>Is this the first time you have hit IIS on that server? ASP.NET or WCF on that server? This particular virtual root on that server? This WcfPortal.svc URL on this server?</p>
<p>Each of those has some &quot;warm up&quot; time. If the svc file is in a virtual root with web pages and other components, I&#39;ve seen the warm up time take seconds, not just milliseconds.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have seen DNS issues cause startup lag. The client has to resolve the server address to an IP address, and mis-configured DNS servers can make this very slow.</p>
<p>And, of course, there&#39;s general network topology to consider. If the DNS or domain server is in India, and the app server is in the US, and the client is in China, it could take a long time to resolve all the addresses, establish network connections, establish authentication, etc.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
