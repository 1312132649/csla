When importing, we convert each spreadsheet to a datatable and then run custom evaluation logic against each column in the table.<br><br>Currently we do this evaluation on the client machine but we would like to offload it to our application servers since the # of rows can be up to 65K in a worksheet (# of columns 255). CSLA's mobile objects seem to be an efficient alternative to using datatables to hold this data, especially when it comes to efficiently moving data to the application server. <br><br>My question is this: How would I define a databindable CSLA-Friendly class (say the SourceData class) that can hold this dynamic set of data and eliminate the need for a datatable? Or, is there a CSLA-friendly way to build a custom object that wraps this datatable and still moves efficiently between servers?<br><br>Thanks in advance for any advice you can give,<br>-Jason<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
