<P>To assist with this, I've written an extension assembly that plugs into Codesmith that reads a "database about our database". There is a companion GUI applications for this database that&nbsp;lists&nbsp;all of our tables, columns&nbsp;and relationships and lets me tag which ones I want to generate child lists/objects for, provide captions and or custom object names, &nbsp;which fields the user can modify, are browsable, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; This extension assembly is also written using CSLA, incidentally... :) </P>
<P>Anyway, to make a long story short. I have a serious sense that I'm reinventing the wheel here and that there are probably better tools already available, hopefully one that can interface with Codesmith. (And as long as the tool writes to a database, I can write the code to have Codesmith extract what it needs). </P>
<P>Can someone point me in the right direction?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
