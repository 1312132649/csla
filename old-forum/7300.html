It would be really nice if it only set the IsEnabled to false as a fallback if the IsReadOnly property couldn't be set.<br /><br />I don't see this as hard to achieve, but if I do, I need to modify the CSLA source for my project, or totally copy the PropertyStatus class and re-implement it (the HandleTarget method where this exists isn't virtual, otherwise I'd just subclass it.)<br /><br />Comments?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, July 19, 2009</h2>That is a bug, thank you for calling it to my attention.
