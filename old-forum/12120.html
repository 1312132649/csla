<p>Is there a structure in CSLA.NET 4 that would allow us to store table specific information for saving? &nbsp;The other piece to this is that we have a front-end that the user can filter and completely change the criteria so for the Retrieve I am dynamically creating the Select statement and the front-end is passing in the Where clause. &nbsp;However the where clause is going to have the property name and I&#39;ll need to translate that to table name and field name when it comes in. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked around online and have been searching for any info on this but haven&#39;t come up with much. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas on this? &nbsp;Thanks in advance! &nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, August 19, 2013</h2><p>No, there is no structure in CSLA .NET where you can store this type of information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen some project using NHibernate mappings by attributes but that would only work on the platforms that NHibernate support (and as such has nothing to do with CSLA .NET)</p>
<p>My preference is to use ObjectFactory or Repository pattern and keep the business objects as &quot;clean&quot; as possible. This means that the criteria representation that comes from the client must be processed on the DAL side to generate the actual where clause/select statement. This will work on ANY platform that CSLA .NET is available on.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bigphildogg86 replied on Wednesday, August 21, 2013</h2><p>Thanks! &nbsp;I figured it couldn&#39;t hurt to ask as I was starting to get the impression after looking around that this wasn&#39;t available. &nbsp;We&#39;ll be doing some mapping I think on the database side between object properties and their table and field names I think at this point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
