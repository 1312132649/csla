<p>One option is for an editable root object to update itself, and also query and update each of the other objects that need to be updated in turn due to the first update.&nbsp; All the logic would be contained in the BO, and only basic CRUD procs would be needed.&nbsp; <em>But this seems expensive</em>, because there would be so many calls and lots of data going across the wire.</p>
<p>The other option (which I&#39;m planning on at this point) is to move this logic into a proc, so the proc could do all the updates required - on the database and without any extra data going across the wire.</p>
<p>Or am I not thinking about the design correctly?&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>skagen00 replied on Saturday, September 15, 2012</h2><p>fwiw, I would likely&nbsp;do this kind of logic in the sproc myself.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, September 16, 2012</h2><p>I&#39;d do it by either a </p>
<ul>
<li>StoredProcedure </li>
<li>or a CommadObject (called from the BO DataPortal_XYZ metods)</li>
</ul>
<p>I would NOT put that logic into the BusinessObject itself. </p>
<p>The choice might vary depending on </p>
<ul>
<li>how many database types must your application support</li>
<li>the skills of your developers </li>
<li>how critical is performance (or how may this affect performance)</li>
