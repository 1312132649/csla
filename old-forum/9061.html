<p>What&#39;s weird is that this dll is in the GAC, I&#39;ve checked and re-checked that.&nbsp; I can&#39;t figure out why this won&#39;t work.&nbsp; Sorry I know it&#39;s an old version of csla, but does anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 10, 2010</h2>Is your business dll also in the GAC?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
