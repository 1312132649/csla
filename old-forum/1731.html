Or are these coded by hand? Seems like for the stored procedure would would include the left and right ID to join between and return all unfiltered columns(except the duplicated join column).</P>
<P>An update I guess would have to know the tables used in the generation and the key between them and the stored procedure would issue a separate update statement for each table involved in the join (possibly wrap these in a transaction).</P>
<P>Not sure if something like this is already written or if it is even worth the effort that would be involved.</P>

Not hard to implement. Just look at how MS Access lets users build queries visually and you get the gist.<br><br>Bayu<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
