<P>Outside of the advantages of being able to easily swap databases and to have strongly typed objects, is there any real point. The other advantage would be to comply with MS Patterns and Practices for Data Objects - does CSLA.Net provide similar efficiency??</P>
<P>In the past I have found the 1:1 mapping done by ORM was rather restrictive in an OO environment,</P>
<P>Any programming opinions on this - should I/shouldn't I? I have no need to shift database types but would be interested in other users experiences/opinions.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

Also can anyone recommend an ORM tool that fits well with CSLA?</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

It makes live so much easier.</P>
