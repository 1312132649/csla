<p>I&#39;ve created a new project in .Net Framework 4 and I&#39;ve referenced Csla v4.5.30. Initially the project worked well. All of a sudden my DAL layer giving the following error and not building the project at all. I&#39;ve tried all the ways (like checking the target frameworks for all the projects in my solution, etc...).</p>
<p>The visual studio displays the following error whenever I tried to build the project.</p>
<p><b>The type or namespace name &#39;Csla&#39; could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)</b></p>
<p>I cross checked the assembly references and everything were in place. And the problem exists in my system only. In my colleague system the project is working and building fine.</p>
<p>And also I&#39;m getting the following warning messages</p>
<p><b>The primary reference &quot;Csla&quot; could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the framework assembly &quot;System.Runtime, Version=2.5.19.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a&quot; which could not be resolved in the currently targeted framework. &quot;.NETFramework,Version=v4.0&quot;. To resolve this problem, either remove the reference &quot;Csla&quot; or retarget your application to a framework version which contains &quot;System.Runtime, Version=2.5.19.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a&quot;.</b></p>
<p>Any help in this regard appreciated.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, January 07, 2014</h2><p>Most likely a problem with reference to nuget package Microsoft.Bcl.Async. </p>
<p>Verify that you have the same nuget packages (and versions) and project references as your colleague has. </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
