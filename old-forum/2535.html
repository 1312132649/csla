I guess you can use reflection&nbsp;in the<FONT color=#000080> Update(object&nbsp;parent)</FONT> method&nbsp;in the collection,&nbsp;but that doesn't seem right eighter.&nbsp; Is there a clever way to support the update method in the collection without scoping the the internal methods in the objects as public?</P>
