<P>I've got fair experience with CSLA 2005 C# and .Net 2.0, but I'm not ready to jump to CSLA 3.7 yet &nbsp;... so I downloaded CSLA 3.0.5 ( to play with Workflow ) ... so now I am proud owner of C# 2005 Business objects, the 2.1 Handbook, and Using 3.0 ... and of course all the posts on this site ....</P>
<P>It's only been a day ... but I can only get Project Tracker Web to work without logging in ... I can't get past the Login screen ... otherwise I'm pulling data from the ProjectTracker DB just fine, but can't seem to configure either the Asp.Net Membership provider or the Local CSLA Security database to recognize passwords.</P>
<P>I'm running VS2008 with .Net Framework 3.5&nbsp; ... Is what I'm trying to do possible ??</P>
<P>Are there instructions / examples of how to get the Membership Provider to work ... an example of Web.Config ???</P>
<P>Thx,</P>

<P>The ProjectTracker sample doesn't use that anyway, it relies on a custom principal that talks to some SQL tables, which is how it has worked since 2001. That part of the application hasn't changed even through today.</P>
<P>If you can't view pages without logging in, then the web.config file must have been altered to disallow anonymous access. The way it is configured in the download is to allow anonymous access to the web site - I think you can get to every page in read-only mode. You just have to log in to edit data.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
