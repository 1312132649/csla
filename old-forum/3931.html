<P>I have a combobox bound to a namevaluelist(nvl). When I invalidateCache of the nvl, I would like to raise an event for the form with the bound nvl. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I am not that good with events to begin with, and when adding shared methods and the singleton pattern nvl pattern, where do I start. So far nothing I try raises the event on the form with the bound combobox.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So far all I can do is resort to a refresh button on the bound form.</P>

<P>Thanks</P>
