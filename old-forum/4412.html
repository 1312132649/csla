<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have requirement where in I need to create a BO for adding a row in one table ,simultaneously add&nbsp;a row in another table.The tables were denormalized due to the size of the single table and some other relationship among the fields.I was thinking of creating just one BO and handle the DB operations in the&nbsp;stored procedure using the ERROR&nbsp;rather than a Single Parent - Single Child BO. Aslo the second insert just adds some default values.Am I doing it right?Are there issues that I am not seeing at this moment?</P>
<P>Thanks In Advance,</P>
