<P>I am in the process of migrating an existing application in CSLA 1.5 to CSLA 2.0. The application also uses ActiveObjects, and FilterableCollectionBase.</P>
<P>Has anybody converted the FilterableCollectionBase to work with CSLA 2.0? Is there a C# version?<BR>Or is there a way to get similar functionallity in the new CSLA without using FilterableCollectionBase?</P>
<P>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR>Jojy</P>

I actually started building this, but got sidetracked and haven't had time to get back to it (it turns out to be harder than SortedBindingList...)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jojy replied on Monday, May 22, 2006</h2><P>Thanks Rocky. Since I am in the middle of migration to CSLA 2.0, I can't wait till somebody does it. I guess I will have to get started on this and see what I can do.</P>
<P>Just an FYI:&nbsp;The&nbsp;CSLA 2.0 migration part is going faily smooth. But a lot of change is being required with the new version of ActiveObjects and also all the Infragistic and Devexpress controls binding (grids, combos). Started off with 10000+ errors (not warnings) in the error list on compile. I've reduced it to a few hundreds now. </P>
