Occasionally Supervisor interaction would be required, so we would be switching context temporarily and then logging off setting the original&nbsp; operator context back. <br><br> I would like to add an event somewhere so if the IPrincipal in Csla.ApplicationContext.User changes it would be raised, I could then attach a handler to a base form of sorts and have it manage all sorts of things under the hood automatically. <br><br>With Csla.ApplicationContext being a static class, that gets ruled out. Anybody have any suggestions on where I can put/work this in? It sounds like a good idea to be able to communicate a user change across&nbsp; an application, maybe i'm wrong... any thoughts?<br><br>Thanks<br><br><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, October 25, 2006</h2>Sounds like a fine idea, although you might be able to tackle this another way.<br><br>In the new PTracker, the Logout changes the principal, then tells all its forms this happened.&nbsp; The business objects 'know' because they always look at ApplicationContext.user anyway.<br><br>What other kind of processing do you need?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bobo replied on Wednesday, October 25, 2006</h2>I saw the Logout in Ptracker but my thinking was that I didn't want a particular UI element, like a logout button, being in control of all the forms. If the IdentityChanged was implemented as an event then any form/UI element could implement its own handling of the event. <br><br>If I'm in a modal dialog of sorts, and i have to do a context change&nbsp; there, my paddle would be sitting next to the logout button somwhere "back&nbsp; there". I&nbsp; would not be able to use that mechanism to do the notification. If all sorts of UI and non-ui elements (maybe even one of those crazy nebulous singletons, that aren't&nbsp; bound to anything), implemented handlers for the IdentityChanged Event&nbsp; then that would seem like a pretty nice "decoupled" way of communicating a Security context switch.<br><br>That was my thinking, <img src="/emoticons/emotion-55.gif" alt="Idea [I]" /><br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
