<P>I am currently working on a CSLA 1.4 (or 5?) and am looking to upgrade it to CSLA 2.&nbsp; Has anyone taken an existing CSLA 1.x&nbsp;app and converted it to use CSLA 2?&nbsp; If so, what kind of issues did you run in to? How much effort was involved? Just trying to get an idea if it's even worth the cost to upgrade.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>

That thread has one post about a user mixing both CSLA 1.x and 2.x in the same project, which is an interesting idea, although I'm looking more for a primary list of the changes someone would have to make to get their code to compile against 2.x.&nbsp; Guess I'll just jump in and find out. :)</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

It was a lot of work, maybe 4 weeks. I am not a veteran CSLA user, been using the framework since around 2003. If you are a veteran you may get the work completed more quickly than ourselves. Make sure you have read the new book before you begin.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>maxmann replied on Tuesday, July 11, 2006</h2><P>Ouch!&nbsp; Not exactly what I wanted to hear. :)</P>
<P>I've worked quite a bit with CSLA 1.x, but just created my first CSLA 2.x class yesterday. The big difference to me seems to be the use of generics.&nbsp; Most other things seem to be consistent with 1.x.&nbsp; Thoughts/Opinions?</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>karl replied on Wednesday, July 12, 2006</h2><P>Yes, the use of generics (easy) . Also we has to rewrite the Data Access methods to use the new DoInsertUpdate pattern. The rules needed some work to implement AddBusinessRules. The NameValue lists have changed. The CanWriteProperty(True) and PropertyHasChanged calls need adding your Business Object Properties. </P>
<P>The above changes are not difficult, its just quite alot of work (we have many classes). &nbsp;</P>
<P>We also use&nbsp;Peter's Active Objects which further complicated things (this was probably the worst bit).</P>
<P>The Winforms UI developement has also changed, the databinding has been updated to allow buisiness objects to be dragged onto forms. &nbsp;</P>
