<p>So the goal is to introduce a 64-bit production server (initially out of the farm) with basically the same code base; however, we did need to make one small change and recompile... (GetHashCode for string&nbsp;differs between 32-bit and 64-bit implementations of .NET, and we errantly used the resulting value as something important which one is not supposed to do apparently!).</p>
<p>We are not changing the version numbers in Assembly Information for our business objects, etc.</p>
<p>Any idea if a Silverlight application garnered from one of the old machines (32-bit ones)&nbsp;would have problems communicating with the WCF endpoint of the new machine (64-bit one), fundamentally?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think serialization/deserialization of objects would be a problem as we&#39;re not changing versions on our business object assemblies, etc.&nbsp; We didn&#39;t add any new properties or anything to any business object... just basically replaced the invocation of GetHashCode to a &quot;GetHashCode32&quot; implementation in a couple of places so that the 64-bit machines would hash a couple of strings in 32-bit fashion where it was needed.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, September 29, 2014</h2><p>I agree, I don&#39;t _think_ serialization should be an issue. The assembly qualified type names aren&#39;t different between 32 and 64 bit platforms, which would be the most likely cause of problems.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
