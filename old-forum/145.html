<P>Designing an application that will be used by field engineers on their laptops in offline mode.&nbsp; Laptops will have CSLA 2.0 with SQL Server Express 2005 (later perhaps SQL Server Everywhere), and will synchronise when online with a central SQL Server through merge replication.&nbsp; I intend to use ClickOnce deployment to get the app deployed and updated.</P>
<P>As updates for this application will become available,&nbsp;inevitably&nbsp;there will be database-schema-changes from time to time.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Any best practices on how to&nbsp;manage&nbsp;database-schema changes&nbsp;and how to distributed them to all the clients, without losing existing data, keeping in mind that not all clients might update at the same time.&nbsp; Some engineers&nbsp;might continue to work with the old version for a couple of days before coming online and get updated, while others have already been updated.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

The merge replication isn't really seen by CSLA. Your business objects should always use the local database. Merge replication updates the database, but I don't think any CSLA-based objects would be involved while the subscription is being merged.<br><br>SQL Server Books Online has numerous in-depth articles regarding merge replication.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, June 01, 2007</h2>Sorry for bringing an old thread back to life..<br><br>I've been considering this question as well though.&nbsp; Its all well and good to say 'books online has articles,' but I'm not sure I've seen answers to some of my questions..<br><br>Like what happens when you have a one to many table, and then change it to a many to many relationship?&nbsp; What happens to new data in the laptop's database in said table?<br><br>If it can't handle such scenarios automatically, then it seems like managing schema updates on the laptops becomes a huge maintenance issue.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
