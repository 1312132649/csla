Does one exist? Seems like I should be able to add and remove from a list (or the underlying relational tables in the database) even though the elements in the list are read-only.</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, November 01, 2007</h2>If that is your goal, then use editable child objects that only have read-only properties. The child object is still editable - it can be added or removed, and thus is clearly being manipulated&nbsp;in more than a read-only manner. But such an object can still have only read-only properties so it is not possible to alter the object's property values.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
