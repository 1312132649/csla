This method intern eventually calls the Update method in the SimpleDataPortal. This Update method contains the logic that determines whether the DataPortal_Update should be called or the DataPortal_Insert or DataPortal_Execute, etc. It does this by looking at the various properties (and not necessarily object properties as in get/set but the type of the object etc)&nbsp;of the object being acted upon.<BR>Hope that helps <BR>Anthony</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, February 16, 2008</h2>If you look at the code in SimpleDataPortal (described in Chapter 4) you'll find that it routes Save() calls to DP_Insert/Update/DeleteSelf based on the state of the object - for objects that subclass BusinessBase. For all other objects (like BusinessListBase or anything else) only DP_Update is called. The other exception are subclasses of CommandBase, where DP_Execute is called.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
