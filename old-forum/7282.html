I guess my question is really<br />is that a one time use?<br /><br />public void DoSomething(arg1, asyncHandler,object>)<br />progressCallBack, DataPortalResult,object> dpCallback) can the<br />server make the call back to progressCallBack more than once?<br /><br />	DoSomething(arg1, (o,e) => updateStaus(e), (o2,e2) =><br />actionCompleted(o2,e2));<br /><br />Could I make a call like:<br /><br />void DoSomething(arg1, asyncHandler,object> progressCallBack1, <br />				asyncHandler,object><br />progressCallBack2,<br />				asyncHandler,object><br />progressCallBack3,<br />				asyncHandler,object><br />progressCallBack4,<br />				DataPortalResult dpCallback)<br /><br />DoSomething(arg1, (o,e)=>updateUI(e), <br />		     (o2,e2)=>updateUI(e),<br />		     (o3,e3)=>updateUI(e),  <br />		     (o4,e4)=>updateUI(e),  <br />		     (o5,e5)=>callbackFinal(o5,e5));<br /><br />I guess the question really boils down to:<br /><br />1) Can you have multiple callbacks and/or can you call one more than once?<br />I thought the callback was the connection back to the client.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />jack<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: ajj3085 [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: July-16-09 6:58 AM<br />To: jaddington@alexandergracie.com<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] Can you make an async callback to the same handler<br />multiple times?<br /><br />The problem with reporting progress back is that it would require the server<br />to open a connection to the client while the processing is occuring.
