I&#39;m now working on a native Win 8 app for my company, and our network/infrastructure folks aren&#39;t comfortable with me using Azure.</p>
<p>For authenticating the clients over the internet for access to back end services within our network, I&#39;m reading through the Using CSLA DataPortal e-book. Specifically, I&#39;m looking at the &quot;Custom Authentication with a Smart Client&quot; section, trying to determine if that is the right route to go. </p>
<p>Does this sound like the right path for native Win 8 clients out in the field to access data back on premises? (e.g. we&#39;d have a DP endpoint in the DMZ that acts as a relay to another DP endpoint on a behind-the-firewall application server, which would then communicate with Active Directory to authenticate and create the principal object.) Thoughts?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
