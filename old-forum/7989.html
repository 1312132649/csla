<P>The change logs are the only list of tactical changes, and the 2008 book is the higher level discussion of how/why 3.6+ works like it does.</P>
<P>Since you are already on 2.1 your job is easier, because the framework is mostly backward compatible to 2.1 - all the way through 3.8. Yes there are some breaking changes as listed in the change logs, but most of them don't impact everyone and several only impact edge cases or specialized advanced scenarios.</P>
<P>There are a small number of bigger changes I think.</P>

<LI>If you use Windows Forms, in 3.0 the framework started enforcing proper use of n-level undo by throwing exceptions if the calls get out of sync. This is a breaking change, in that it reveals bugs many people didn't know they had in their UI code, enabling you to fix them.</LI>
<LI>If you use Windows Forms, in 3.0.2&nbsp;n-level undo changed (when invoked by data binding) to mirror DataTable behaviors to fix issues with data binding; in many cases this has only positive impact, but is something to note</LI>
<LI>In 3.5 the AutoCloneOnUpdate was switched so it defaults to true, thereby fixing a host of save-related issues, but also breaking some UI code where Save() was called without using the return value. You can either set AutoCloneOnUpdate to the old behavior and live with it, or you can fix your UI code to be correct.</LI></OL>
