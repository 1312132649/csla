I would then set a few properties until all the validation rules have been satisfied. The other day I encountered an object, that also starts out as invalid, but the object must only become valid after a method has been executed.<br /><br />What is the recommended way to handle this. Usually validation rules apply to properties. Should I create a 'fake' property and then execute the PropertyHasChanged('fake') in the method ?<br /><br />Regards</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Wednesday, June 24, 2009</h2>One possibility is to have a "real" protected property that is set to true at the end of the method that must be executed. <br /><br />Then you add a simple validation rule that is broken if the property is false, and passes otherwise. <br /><br />No fakery required. </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
