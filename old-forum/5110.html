All other controls (if any) are inside one of these container controls.</P>
<P>So if you want to use an explicit DropDownList, you'd put it in a FormView. Or you can just use a GridView or DetailsView and set the column type to be a dropdown.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Thursday, July 17, 2008</h2><P>Okay.&nbsp; I got it.&nbsp; I just did a Bind on the SelectedItem of the DropDownList.&nbsp; The control was in a FormView.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ideas on how to add a null item (or rather a Guid.Empty) item?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
