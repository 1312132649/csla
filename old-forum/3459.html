I'm starting with an emty resources collection in project edit, then I add (without any apply in between). </P>
<P>Then the edit levels are like this:</P>
<P>_project.Editlevel 2</P>
<P>_project._resources.Items[0].Editlevel 2<BR>_project._resources.Items[1].Editlevel 1<BR>_project._resources.Items[2].Editlevel 1<BR>_project._resources.Items[3].Editlevel 1</P>
<P>Why does the first item get editlevel 2 but all the rest 1? I haven't really search the forum for this, but anyway..</P>

And you should make sure you are looking at the 3.0.2 version, as it is the only one that's reliable in this regard.</P>
<P>Data binding <EM>always</EM> has the "current" object at an elevated edit level. In ProjectEdit for example, the Project itself is "current", and one of the line items bound to the grid is "current". The currency is managed by the bindingsource objects. Each bindingsource has one "current" object, and that object will be at an elevated edit level.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>PederSvaleng replied on Monday, September 03, 2007</h2>Thank's for your reply!
