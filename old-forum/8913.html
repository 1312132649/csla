<p>Today, the problems are:</p>
<p>1) As soon as my cursor leaves focus from the UserName field, the form posts back, which does not allow me to type in a password.</p>
<p>2) If I put in the password first, the process still fails to log me in.</p>
<p>3) I was able to request a new password, but still could not log in with it.</p>
<p>4) As I&#39;ve done in the past, I created another new account so that I could post questions on the forums.</p>
<p>5) I chose the help option and filled out a support ticket with some agency called Telligent (I think), but based on the questions, I suspect they will not be able to &quot;help&quot; with the login problems.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
