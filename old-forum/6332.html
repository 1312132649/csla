<P>In the case of an update type operation, I don't&nbsp; call CheckRules() on an object loaded from the database, so the only rules associated with the changes are called. </P>
<P>It's possible to be very creative, though. You can associate rules with non-existent property names, so they are never automatically called. If you want to call them yourself, you can call CheckRules just for that "pseudo" property. Some people here have used this to do server-side specific processing if I recall correctly. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
