<P>Installing on VS 2008 Express/Vista and even after removing and re-adding references I get many errors for ProjectTracker.Library.&nbsp; When I look on my machine I can't even locate the projecttracker.library.dll? Is that the problem? If so where do I get it?</P>
<P>All help would be much appreciated as I really want to get going with this. I've tried both v2.0 and v.3.5 (using VB).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Joffies replied on Thursday, August 28, 2008</h2><P>You will have to re-add references to CSLA&nbsp;for all projects within the PT solution which uses it. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
