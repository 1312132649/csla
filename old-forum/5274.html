<br><br>Premise:<br><br>Best practices for CSLA use are to use the CSLA framework as-shipped.&nbsp; There are ample provisions for modifying behavior via overridden classes, methods, etc., so like most integrations, modification of the framework itself should be a last resort.<br>

<br>Modification of the framework itself is defined to be an &quot;experts only&quot; activity, and as such, we&#39;re more comfortable with the idea that these experts have to be fluent in both VB.Net and C# if they&#39;re in a VB.Net shop.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think this is too far-fetched.<br>
<br>I also think this opens the door to a discussion of documentation (including the books).&nbsp; Some subset of the users of CSLA just want to use CSLA - they&#39;re never going to tweak any code, and that&#39;s perfectly appropriate.&nbsp; For these users, they&#39;re far better served in understanding implementation best practices, including how best to upgrade-proof their applications, vs. understanding the inner implementation of the framework code itself.&nbsp; Maybe at that point, the &quot;how it&#39;s built&quot; stuff turns into an e-book or something for the hard-core guys who what to step through the framework.<br>
<br>To summarize, the framework becomes a DLL with source code available, rather than source code that you can compile into a DLL.<br><br>As is always the case with such comments, this is just my opinion, so flame away....<br>
