It was a bit painful, and I am not sure I would recommend this approach unless necessary.<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: ixman [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Friday, January 30, 2009 1:11 PM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: [CSLA .NET] Async Properties on BO<br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />Did anybody tried to asynchronously load properties on a business object?

<P>You may consider having different objects for each page of the UI - each step in the use case. Instead of trying to merge everything into a single object with complex properties, make your life simpler and have a set of different objects that work together to achieve the end goal.</P>
<P>You can have methods on your "first" object to start the async load of subsequent objects. That can help keep a good level of abstraction in the UI (so it doesn't have the logic to understand how to create the other objects). Or probably better, the factory methods of the subsequent objects can accept a reference to the "first" object as a parameter.</P>
<P>For example, suppose my first object is OrderDetail. So my first form loads an OrderDetail and binds it for the user. The user clicks something that takes them to another form, that requires loading a much more expensive object&nbsp;(like ProductDetail that includes a Picture property).</P>
<P>The ProductDetail factory method might have this signature:</P>
<P>public static GetProductDetail(OrderDetail order, int itemIndex, ... callback)</P>
<P>The UI can invoke this factory easily enough, but the method signature makes it very clear that this object can only be retrieved after you've got an OrderDetail object and someone has selected some item index.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
