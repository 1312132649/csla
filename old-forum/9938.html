I have a simple class that&#39;s an EditableRoot that has a few basic properties. I did not override the Save method, but I did override the DataPortal_Insert and DataPortal_Update methods. I was just running a set of tests on the object to make sure everything worked ok. Here&#39;s the code for it:</p>
<p>m_decal = Decal.NewDecal();<br />m_decal.DecalTypeCode = &#39;S&#39;;<br />m_decal.PrintInsertDate = null;<br />m_decal.PrintLabelDate = &quot;01/14/2011&quot;;<br />m_decal.Save();<br />m_decal.PrintInsertDate = &quot;01/14/2011&quot;;<br />m_decal.Save();<br />m_decal.Delete();<br />m_decal.Save();</p>
<p>I expected the second Save to run the DataPortal_Update(), but it ran the Insert again. I checked the IsDirty and IsNew properties after the first Save and saw that they were still set to true. I then put in MarkOld() at the end of my DataPortal_Insert() function to try and get different results, but with no success. I&#39;m using CSLA 4.0.1.0 if that helps.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone has any easy tips or tricks on how to make my posts look better without going into the html, I&#39;d appreciate that too.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Steve</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Thursday, January 13, 2011</h2><p>The &quot;Save&quot; method returns a new object, which you need to hook up to your reference.&nbsp; So your calls should look like this:</p>
<p>m_decal = m_decal.Save()</p>
<p>The returned object will have the updated IsDirty, IsNew, etc. values in it.</p>
<p>Can&#39;t help you with the post formatting - going into the HTML is the only way I&#39;ve found to get certain things done.</p>
<p>HTH</p>
