<P>We are currently developeing a smart client using the SCSF (Smart Client Software Factory)/CAB and using CSLA.NET 2.0 for our Business Layer. We have created our custom recipes for implementing CAB and other things using GAT - what we are looking at is maybe porting our My Generation CSLA templates to GAT so that everything is encompassed in the Visual Studio IDE for our developers. I just wanted to find out if anybody has done this, or if anyone else&nbsp;is interested in starting a project to accomplish this. Just a thought????</P>

All the CSLA classes are generated via recipes and we have customized the SCSF as well as added VS templates for a common smart part structure. So far so good. It was a pretty easy task to port my Generateion&nbsp; templates to GAT recipes. I havent found a way to share code between recipes for common CSLA methods yet, as in code smith. But I havent really had time to look into it either. <br>J<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Rooster replied on Wednesday, September 13, 2006</h2>Awesome Solutrian, I think it's some thing worth while to embark on seeing as you guys have got it to work. GAT is supposed to be Microsoft's answer to CodeSmith and it seems that the P &amp; P guys are investing some time in it, so it looks like it will be growing. <IMG alt="DansDreams is not online.

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; GAT is a tool to build wizards, "software factories" into Visual Studio
that can generate code like code smith or mygeneration the syntax is similar to
asp and doesnâ€™t imply any platform. The SCSF uses it to generate the basic
template code for a CAB app. Microsoft has other software factories that use gat

<P>Rob</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>justncase80 replied on Tuesday, September 26, 2006</h2><P>I believe that the GAT focuses more on generating setup projects and files. Its essentially a way for you to make custom project types and custom file types and editors. So in VS when you click "file-&gt;new-&gt;project" and a new project is created with a bunch of files and settings, the GAT is essentially giving you the power to do this. In addition when you right click on a project or file object you can see entries for "Add-&gt;New Web Form" and such, you can add your own custom file types to these menus. </P>
<P>As far as I know the GAT does not give you (beyond maybe some refactoring capabilities) the ability to "regenerate your code in a single click". You may be able to coerce it into doing this through some hard work but its not exactly what it was intended for (as far as I understand it at least).</P>
<P>However, you could build a code generator that uses the GAT to integrate itself into Visual Studio nicely and that code generator could do all your generating... but that is perhaps beyond the scope of just this thread.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Solutrian replied on Thursday, September 28, 2006</h2>As MS states: "<span>The Guidance Automation Toolkit

This is a really great idea and the GAT is really cool.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
