<P>It talks about the only known way to get this correct (which is in the 3.0.2 code).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dantes1 replied on Thursday, September 06, 2007</h2>rocky, i tried my idea... i created a counter for the editlevel. then on the save method i just created a loop until the counter decrements to zero... inside the loop is an ApplyEdit...<br><br>when i run&nbsp; it worked though... when i edited a certain item then go to another item and edit it. then click the cancel button... it works... but always when i already had many changes... when i click the cancel button... two items where restored at the same time...<br><br>i havent read thoroughly the link you gave me though...<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
