I have it working fine on my local server, but having trouble applying the context via the dataportal. I am probably missing something.&nbsp;How would I pass the authorization credentials to server side? Or would I have to?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, February 10, 2009</h2>If you have custom principal/identity objects that&nbsp;are Serializable, you just need to set the CslaAuthentication config setting to "Csla" (on client and server) and the data portal will do the work for you.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
