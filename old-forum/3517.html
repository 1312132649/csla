What objects would i need to build in order for this to happen. I can see how it is built using .net provider tiers through Telligent's Community Server, but i would like to convert that community server's architecture ( which is .net provider tiers)&nbsp;into csla.net 3.0. I've run into a few problems with inheritance and permissions,&nbsp;and i need some sort of workaround. Anyhelp would be extremely appreciative.</P>
