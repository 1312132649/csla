<P>How do you manage the database dependency in your projects.</P>
<P>For example, if you modify a database field, how do you find what clases are affected by this change?</P>
<P>If you use storeprecedures for any database access seems to be easy using a specific name convention or something similar but if you use embeded sql commands seems to be more dificult.</P>
<P>What are your best practices for this issue?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, February 06, 2008</h2><P>I use embedded SQL and it is not a real problem at all.</P>
<P>I have separate classes for each database table. Each class contains the SQL statements used for that table. I code generate the CRUD methods plus some other basic methods that prove useful. Then I inherit from that class and hand write any other SQL needed.</P>
<P>The point is that when I change a DB table by adding a field then I re-generate the CRUD class and then get compile errors on all the BOs that use it. I usually am able to just re-generate those BOs and the problem is solved. Sometimes I have to check the hand coded levels to ensure the new field does not affect them too.</P>
