The rule needs to consider a combination of a property in the item as well as another property in an object that contains the collection. For example:<br /><br />Class ParentRoot<br />  Property PropA As Boolean<br />  ReadOnly Property PropB As ChildCol<br /><br />Class Child<br />   Property Prop1<br /><br />If Prop1 is a certain value and PropA is a certain value, prevent the child instance from being removed from the collection.<br /><br />I don't see a way of writing a rule method in the parent because the child's removal wouldn't hit any parent property. I've tried throwing an exception from the RemovingItem event handler in ParentRoot, but I cannot figure out where to handle this exception in the UI's BindingSource or DataGridView.<br /><br />Any thoughts?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
