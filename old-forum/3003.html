<P>Decorate the properties that you want hidden with the Browsable(False) attribute.&nbsp; That is what works for me.</P>

<P>Jeff</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dshafer replied on Thursday, June 14, 2007</h2><P>Another solution would be to "build" your grids in code.&nbsp; I know this sounds like a pain, but I've had problems&nbsp;with&nbsp;grids that were setup using&nbsp;the UltraGrid designer bound to a bindingsource.&nbsp; Specifically, when you add a new property to the business object, it is automagically added to the grid, and if I remember correctly, the order of the columns in the grid is also jumbled.&nbsp; I created a base grid class that inherited from the ultra grid and added some "helper" methods that would make building the grids in code less of a struggle.&nbsp; Specifically I call a setup method with an ordered ArrayList of the columns/properties that I want to be visible in the grid, and all others have visible set to false.&nbsp; This base class&nbsp;is also a nice place to add helper methods for setting up columns that will be using the ultradropdown.</P>
