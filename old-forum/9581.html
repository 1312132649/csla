<p>I don&#39;t know whether you&#39;ll be able to get WP7 to work with pre-4 versions of CSLA, but I don&#39;t know you can&#39;t either.&nbsp; From Rocky&#39;s posts, it sounds like WP7 is a somewhat-modified version of Silverlight 3,&nbsp;with the main issues he&#39;s had seeming to fall under back-porting code constructs in 4 that don&#39;t work in WP7.&nbsp; So maybe you could get it working with potentially less work than what he&#39;s been going through.&nbsp; But it&#39;s been a while since I read the posts, so I may be remembering wrong.</p>
<p>If nothing else, you should be able to look on SVN and see if he&#39;s made anything available.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure any code that&#39;s out there is &quot;use at your own risk&quot;, but it would at least give you some idea of where he&#39;s going.</p>
