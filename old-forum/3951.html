"The maximum message size quota for incoming messages (65536) has been exceeded". I am using windows xp and I found some info on this problem but the solutions offered didn't seem to work. It is obvious I need to increase the size limit, but where should that change be made?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 28, 2007</h2><P>More web-savvy people than me can probably provide a better answer.</P>
<P>But there are several places this could happen. The most common is at the ASP.NET level itself - in web.config you can add an entry in &lt;system.web&gt; to control the max message size.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;httpRuntime executionTimeout="300" maxRequestLength="16384" /&gt;<BR></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Wednesday, November 28, 2007</h2><P>In your wcf binding on the server, and possibly on the client as well,&nbsp;put in the attribute maxReceivedMessageSize="165530" or whatever value you want.&nbsp; You can find an example at the bottom of this post, though, it has a lot of other crap in there that I don't think you would need. <A HREF="/forums/post/17629.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/post/17629.aspx</A></P>
