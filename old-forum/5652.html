Right now the PropertyInfoManager is scoped as internal, so there's not a way to get a list of registered properties for a type without having an instance of that type.</P>
<P>What is your scenario?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FrankM replied on Thursday, October 23, 2008</h2>I am building a general search window, idea is passing a BO, then
populate all the fields to let user choose and set search criteria. <br>
<br>
Seems creating instance is the only way, my work around is just warp "FieldManager.GetRegisteredProperties()" in another static method, so UI code just need to call "BO.PropertyList".<br><br>What's the concern to make FieldManager not public?<br>&nbsp;
