<p>How come the non-static DataPortal&lt;T&gt; does not provide Child_XYZ methods like BeginChildFetch?&nbsp; Am I missing something here?&nbsp; It seems like the async operations only work with root objects then I need to manually MarkAsChild().</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 11, 2010</h2><p>The child data portal never moves the calling context across the network. That is entirely outside of the scope of the child data portal.</p>
<p>Lazy loading is somewhat of a special case where you are loading a child, but you (very probably) need to move the calling context across the network. So you have to use the root data portal to do that.</p>
<p>The most <em>elegant</em> solution is to create a command object that runs to the server to create/retrieve the child. So the command object is responsible for going across the network, and the command it executes is a DataPortal.FetchChild() on the server.</p>
<p>Most people short-circuit this by doing what you are doing, which is to implement a DataPortal_Fetch() method in the child object and to explicitly call MarkAsChild() in that method.</p>
<p>But if you want to avoid that messiness, use the command object solution.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xetal replied on Friday, February 12, 2010</h2><p>Doh.&nbsp; Thanks!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Calin replied on Friday, February 19, 2010</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Nice ideea do you happen to have a example of this in your videos or the book ?</p>
