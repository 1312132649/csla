Actually, overall I'm just not really sure what to do!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, April 01, 2008</h2>You don't design objects based on the data they will hold; design them based on use cases. So you need to figure out all the different ways a user will interact with your application, and design an object or set of objects for each case.&nbsp; Finish, Thinkness and maybe FasciaDetail sound like they all describe a part of the product so it could be that they end up being properties of a product class.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, April 01, 2008</h2><P>It may help to consider each screen in your app as a Use Case.</P>
<P>So if you have 1 gigantic screen where the user can edit everything then you should probably have 1 gigantic BO.</P>
<P>But hopefully you break down the screens into smaller pieces. In that case you should have a series of smaller BOs to handle the requirements for each screen.</P>

Still having a hard time getting away from my database driven design philosophies of the past! .. and learning application development from start to finish on the way.<img src="/emoticons/emotion-10.gif" alt="Embarrassed [:$]" /><br><br>With the problem at hand, it is meant for one very large screen full of data, but I'm working on breaking it down into user controls that handle the data for each section. <br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
