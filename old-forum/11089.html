Our connection string has a timeout value in it which is not honored by the SqlCommand. I don&#39;t want to have to manually change every use of the SqlCommand object in order to increase my default timeout from 30 to 60.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Wednesday, January 25, 2012</h2><p>Although not a CSLA.NET question, the answer is &quot;No, you can&#39;t&quot;. The timeout in the connection string refers to the lenght of time to make the connection itself, not the length of time to execute queries or commands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a timeout property on the SqlCommand class.</p>
<p>var cmd = new SqlCommand();</p>
<p>cmd.CommandTimeout = 120; // this means 120 seconds</p>
<p>The default command timeout is 30 seconds.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Gort replied on Friday, January 27, 2012</h2><p>Yes, I understand this. I just didn&#39;t want to have to do this on ALL of my calls in order to increase it.&nbsp; I guess I may not have a choice.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
