There are sample template classes in the Support folder along with the snippets. They aren&#39;t Visual Studio Template items - just examples showing structure.</p>
<p>It turns out to be a lot of work to create actual VS templates and make them installable. (the installer part is the killer) In the last couple releases someone volunteered to do all that work, which was really nice. Nobody has stepped up to do this work yet for CSLA 4, though it has certainly been discussed.</p>
<p>So I suspect it will happen at some point - when someone has the time and energy to fight with the installer stuff for a while.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SeanO replied on Wednesday, August 11, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Rocky. &nbsp;For some reason, the installer didn&#39;t put them in the Support folder. &nbsp;I only got the snippets. &nbsp;I ended up going into the repository and downloading them from there.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, August 11, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;ll have to check the installer to see what&#39;s up then. I must say that creating and maintaining installers is a serious PITA... <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lloydmcd replied on Friday, September 17, 2010</h2><p>Was there any resolution to the installer problem(s)?&nbsp; We&#39;re having issues where the CSLA item templates install for some users, but not others.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Would it be possible to post the item template project source as was done for the 3.x versions?&nbsp; That way we could&nbsp;shoulder the responsibility of maintaining them.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 17, 2010</h2><p>The installer should be putting the template files into a Templates folder - starting in 4.0.1 - or so says the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=ef41332f-16a2-441e-81d3-260403a196bf">change log</a>.</p>
<p>These are still not VS templates - they are just example class files.</p>
<p>There is no current VS template source code. Each version was created by a different person, and after each version that person never came back. I can only assume, therefore, that creating these templates is such a PITA that one run at them burns people out <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p>
<p>That said, I&#39;d surely welcome help getting a set of CSLA 4 VS templates put together!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
