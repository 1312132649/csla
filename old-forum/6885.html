Thanks for sharing.<br />When I started 5+ years ago I knew we needed a framework. But luckily I had no idea how to build one and so I actually read the book before starting any coding. Cover to cover. And then flipping through it quite a bit after that. Your story about building an in house framework sent chills down my spine. Ouch!<br /><br />Your comments on using more standard examples is a good one. Project tracker tries to show the various ways that you *can* do things. It does *not* show the best way to do everything.<br /><br />CSLA has come a long way since version 1.x. I am so glad we chose it and that we have been able to keep up with the changes. Converting from 1.x to 2.x was very painful. But conversions since then have been easy in comparison!<br /><br />Joe<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Thursday, April 30, 2009</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>JoeFallon1:</strong></div><div>Your story about building an in house framework sent chills down my spine.

<P>As you may be aware, I'm in the process of releasing about 7 hours of video content that walks through, in detail, what you need to know and do to build a CSLA .NET for Silverlight application.

<p class=MsoNormal><span>CSLA .NET for Silverlight allows you to share 85-95% of your
business object code between Windows and SL. So at the business class
implementation level, the Windows and SL versions of CSLA are <i>very</i>
close.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>At the UI level the story is obviously different, as XAML in SL
is different from WPF (to some degree) and of course is quite different from
Windows Forms or ASP.NET.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So if you look at the videos in the series, segments 1 (intro/background),
5 (object types) and 6 (data access) are useful to .NET as well as SL. Segment
4 is also somewhat useful to .NET, but I&#8217;d guess over half the content is
entirely SL specific.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>In terms of tooling for WPF/SL, I absolutely think there&#8217;s
wisdom in waiting for VS10. Even in VS08 you really need to plan for writing
XAML by hand. For a developer with a web background that&#8217;s probably not
such a big deal, but for a developer with a Windows background it seems (and is
imo) extremely primitive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The point of my previous post however, is that if the SL video
series is successful (meaning enough people buy it to make it worth my time to
have created them), then I&#8217;ll almost certainly create similar videos
(series and/or singles) covering .NET, WPF, ASP.NET MVC and other topics of
interest. Windows Forms would be in that list, because it is, and will be for
some time, a widely used technology.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ll put a lot of focus on VB. It isn&#8217;t
realistic to record and produce the videos twice, and sales of VB content is
substantially lower than C# content, so I&#8217;m afraid the economics just
aren&#8217;t there at this point in time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
