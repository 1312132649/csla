<P>It appears that there is no problem with tagging CSLA with a CLSCompliant tag. Is there any reason why it shouldn't be? Is the general concept that if a project is marked with the CLSCompliant flag that it would be fully extensible in other languages other than the one it was written in? That it adheres to the common language specification? </P>
<P>If not, could someone educate me? Thanks! </P>

I was surprised how many FxCop/CodeAnalysis issues came up in the framework at that point. I haven't checked the 2.0 release against it to know how much better it is at this point from that standpoint.</P>
