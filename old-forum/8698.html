<p>No overload for method &#39;GetValue&#39; takes 2 arguments</p>
<p>It&#39;s happening in the&nbsp;CslaModelBinder.cs class in the following line of code...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bindingContext.ModelState.SetModelValue(item.Property, bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue(controllerContext, item.Property));</p>
<div>If I remove the controllerContext parameter ... as it doesn&#39;t look like GetValue supports it ... I am able to build.</div>

<div>Am I doing something wrong here?</div>
</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, March 20, 2010</h2><p>This is in the Csla.Web.Mvc project, and occurs because you don&#39;t have the same version of ASP.NET MVC 2 we&#39;re currently using (or that we were using when that particular code was created).</p>
<p>The problem is that ASP.NET MVC 2 is changing rapidly, and it is not in sync with VS10 or .NET 4 - nor will it be in sync, it is not being released as part of .NET 4.</p>
<p>This is why we split the MVC support into its own assembly/project - so you can use the rest of CSLA 4 even if you don&#39;t have or want MVC.</p>
<p>If you do want to use MVC, you&#39;ll have to fix the code. Or maybe grab the most current code from my svn repository, because that might match the MVC version you are using.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
