<P>Is there an attribute to tell the data portal to fetch with a web service when all other fetches are local?&nbsp; We have a Single-Sign-On system and all applications need to authenticate via the web service.&nbsp; Most everything else will run locally.&nbsp; At the moment, I'm just hard coding the web service into the fetch but was wondering if a more pure way exists in CSLA 2.0</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>The data portal allows you to run your business components on an application server - possibly using web services as a transport.</P>
<P>However, what you are describing (I think) is a web service you are calling in order to authenticate the user. That web service would continue to be a web service even if you set up an app server for the data portal right? So it makes no sense to have a remote data portal to call a remote web service (that's two network hops where you needed one).</P>
<P>I view (non-service-oriented) web services as being no different from stored procedures in a database. Rather than using ADO.NET to set up and execute your command you are using a web service proxy, but that's just plumbing. From an archtiectural and design perspective there's no difference between a web service and a stored procedure.</P>
<P>So I suggest that you are dong the right thing - you've put the data access code (the web service call) into your DataPortal_Fetch() method, just like you would have with a stored procedure call. All is good.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brent replied on Friday, May 19, 2006</h2><P>Thanks Rocky.&nbsp; Wiring it into the Identity.GetIdentity&nbsp;Fetch and using our implementation of the CslaCredentials&nbsp;is killing two birds with one stone.&nbsp; Very smooth!</P>
