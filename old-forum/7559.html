I need to clear the collection and add new items to the collection but cannot just replace the collection because of some binding/sorting issues working with WPF toolkit datagrid.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, September 02, 2009</h2><P>It doesn't really work that way, so I'm not sure there's an answer.</P>
<P>Certainly you can do DeletedList.Clear() from inside your collection - that'd entirely remove the items that were moved to the DeletedList without actually deleting them from the database.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
