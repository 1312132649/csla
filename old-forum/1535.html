<P>Each open object would get a GUID ticket that would be stored in ViewState of the page(s). Items would be cached by that GUID ticket. If you use a single session variable for a particular page, what happens if you have multiple records open? Can't do it. If I want to edit Joe Blow and Scarlet Johansen at the same time, the variables collide. To me that's a real issue.</P>
<P>Obviously at some point these variables need to expire. I've been considering using the built in ASP.Net Caching but I'm not entirely sure that's the only answer that I'd use. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Friday, December 22, 2006</h2><P>Just wondering if anyone has had any luck with this?</P>
<P>I too was concerned about tabbed browsers (esp. w/ IE7 now supporting it) when I saw Rocky's implementation with a single Session key for each page.&nbsp; In my case, I am using a tab control in my application that allows multiple objects to be "open" at the same time.&nbsp; So, there's no getting around this for me!</P>
<P>Anyway, I also came up with the idea of assigning a GUID value as the Session key for each page and storing that value in the page's ViewState so that the object can be recovered from Session on post-back.&nbsp; This works great and when multiple pages are "open" they each key their BO with a unique identifier in Session as planned.&nbsp; HOWEVER, I am running into a problem where ViewState returns null on post-back!</P>
<P>I have tried everything I can to get this squared away including explicitly enabling ViewState at the Page and UserControl level (even though IsTrackingViewState was already true in both cases). I also looked into using the new ControlState feature but that didn't work either.&nbsp; I don't know if this has something to do with the FormView and CslaDataSource controls being used in the UserControl or what.&nbsp; But it is increasingly frustrating to have something that should be a given create so many headaches.</P>
<P>Anyway, if anyone has been successful in implementing this, I'm curious how you accomplished it.</P>
<P>Thx</P>
