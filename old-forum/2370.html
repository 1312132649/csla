I believe it is probably a simple concept, but one I am just not grasping (I have been working in data normalization-based system for a long time, and the behavior-normalization concept is fairly new, but sensible to me).</P>
<P>This is the way my project is setup:<BR>I have three root objects:<BR>1) Participant - Represents domestic information for a single person; Such as Name, Birth Date, Address, Etc.<BR>2) Group - Represents a "Client" (id, name, effective date, banking information)<BR>3) Account - Represents a "family" of participants that are members of A "Group".<BR><BR>Within the account object, I have a list of "Enrollee" objects, which represent the association of a Participant to an Account. Also, within the account, I need a way to reference the Group that the account is associated with.</P>
<P>This is my question:<BR>I am not sure how to setup the association of an account to a group. I thought, initially, that I should have a literal reference to the Group object, but I ran into some issues with fetching my account object and not being able to load my group object unless I wanted to "fully" load my group object. So, then I thought that "behavior" tells me I need&nbsp;a seperate object (perhaps) called "AccountGroup" that represents only the minimal information I need from the group for the account. That worked out OK, with the exception that I now run into a problem with binding to controls on the form. If I have a screen that shows a combo-box of all my Group objects in the system, how do I databind the selection of the control to my account object when the account object has an "AccountGroup" property, instead of a "Group" property.<BR><BR>Perhaps I am missing something far more fundamental... I am not sure. Any help understanding what the "correct" thing to do is would be greatly appreciated.<BR><BR>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonStonecash replied on Sunday, February 18, 2007</h2>The fuzziness may come from some confusion about what the use cases are.&nbsp; The use cases drive the behaviors that you need from the objects.&nbsp; From your description, I am guessing that you have a use case that deals with reviewing/updating an account.&nbsp; Part of that review is specifying the group to which the account should belong.&nbsp; I assume that the group id is a column within the Accounts table (with a foreign key linkage to support referential integrity).&nbsp; I will further assume that each group has a name or title that is human-friendly and should appear in the group dropdown on the review/update account form.&nbsp; Given all of this, the behavior involved is to pick a group ID (from the list) that is to be stored in the Accounts table row.&nbsp; To support this behavior, the Account(review/update) object only needs a GroupID property, rather than a reference to some type of Group object.&nbsp; <br><br>If you have additional use cases involving the Account, you might well have different&nbsp; objects; some of those varients of the Account may&nbsp; have a need to actually reference a variation of a Group object, rather than just the GroupID.&nbsp; The way that I try to think about these variations to compare them to the concepts of multiple views of the same underlying reality.&nbsp; Obviously each view has to share some common elements with all of the other views of the underlying reality, but each view may be quite different.&nbsp; The differences come about because of the purpose (use case) that each view is designed to serve.<br><br>Jon Stonecash<br>Magenic Technologies<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
