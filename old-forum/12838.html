Now, I am looking to start a similar project&nbsp;and was wondering if&nbsp;this is still a good bet. We need a&nbsp;solid, reliable and&nbsp;Scalable distributed windows framework&nbsp;(some functionality might be extended to web and mobile in the future). I am still interested in a reliable business object framework and CSLA is a&nbsp;familiar entity. Is it still a good bet?&nbsp;Also, CodeSmith seems to be lagging with regards to supporting the latest CSLA versions&nbsp;(is there an up to date template generator&nbsp;out there?). I would appreciate your thoughts and guidance. Thank you in advance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Saturday, February 28, 2015</h2><p>Heh, that&#39;s funny, I did the same about 10 years ago as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;d say absolutely yes.&nbsp; many things introduced into newer versions of Csla would have made that system even easier to build and deploy.&nbsp; Business rules becoming real classes are the first thing that comes to mind as you can directly test them now and reuse is easier.</p>
<p>Check out the release notes to see what other improvements have been introduced.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>AbbasMalik replied on Sunday, March 01, 2015</h2><p>You can use cslagenFork for code generation. <a href="http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com/">http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com/</a></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>issuarez replied on Monday, March 02, 2015</h2><p>Thank you for the feedback. I&#39;ll check out the improvements. Any concerns come to mind with regards to sustainability into the future as we need to commit to another decade or two long project? Thank you.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>issuarez replied on Monday, March 02, 2015</h2><p>Thank you. In fairness to CodeSmith I did find out that they do seem to be up to speed with regards to changes to the framework. I will check out this other generator as well. Thanks again.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
