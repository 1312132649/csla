<P>IMHO, it sounds to me like I would make each "list" an EditableRootList, thus giving it it's own DAL. This would give you the finer granularity you need&nbsp;and you can just call the Get whenever you want to update the UI data (as they navigate to new areas of the application as you say).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
