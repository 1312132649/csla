I think we used "circular references" or something like that.</P>
<P>There are a couple reasons.</P>
<P>First, while the BinaryFormatter does support the concept, you'll find that the size of the byte stream gets <EM>much</EM> larger if you have a circular reference in your graph. It is often worth breaking the reference with NonSerialized and reconnecting it on deserialization to avoid that overhead.</P>
<P>Second, n-level undo doesn't use the BinaryFormatter&nbsp;- not to maintain its parent-child relationships anyway. While UndoableBase could perhaps be enhanced to handle this concept, it just has never been a big enough issue to justify the effort that would take. Dealing with circular references is non-trivial (I know - I wrote a serializer from scratch a few years ago), so it would have to be a pretty pressing issue to make it worth the trouble.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
