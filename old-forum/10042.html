<p>In the UsingCsla4-03-DataAccess ebook I&nbsp;noticed that on Chapter 5: Data Portal Configuration you aren&#39;t planning to cover DataPortal configuration for RemotingProxy although it&#39;s still supported by CSLA4. Or is it?</p>
<p>Regards</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 07, 2011</h2><p>I almost pulled it out of CSLA 4 and put it into the Samples folder (along with the asmx and Enterprise Services proxy/host pairs). I just ran out of time to do that and didn&#39;t want to delay the release.</p>
<p>So yes, it is basically deprecated.</p>
<p>If remoting is working for you and is useful, by all means keep using it. But Microsoft shifted all their efforts to WCF years ago, and I&#39;ve followed their lead.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
