I had to turn off Option Strict as it doesn't like late binding. After that I still have 78 errors ranging from missing files to places where C# code is being used.&nbsp; Is this a bad download? or upload? or is this not ready?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, November 24, 2008</h2>The Vb version was taken over by the community, I believe.&nbsp; So it's up to them to keep the code up to date.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
