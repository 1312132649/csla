<p>This wouldn&#39;t be terribly hard to do, but I wonder about the visual representation? Where would you have the error icon appear? And anywhere you put it, wouldn&#39;t it look odd?</p>
<p>I wonder if a better answer isn&#39;t to make the PropertyInfo control pick up object level broken rules (if you don&#39;t specify a property for the control). This control is completely lookless (it has no visuals at all), and you could therefore use it to implement a broken rule display that would fit nicely into your UI style.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, June 16, 2011</h2><p>Or maybe create a separate ObjectInfo control for object level rules. We&#39;ve discussed creating a ObjectInfo control in our CSLA projects. </p>
<p>PropertyInfo and PropertyStatus is as the name incurs - tied to properties- and it&#39;s not that obvious to set the propertyInfo to null for Object level Broken rules.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
