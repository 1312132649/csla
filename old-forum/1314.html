When a BusinessListBase-derived collection is saved, the Save() method returns a new instance of the collection, and you need to re-bind to that new collection.<br><br>The child items in the collection are also new, so any bindings to child objects must also be refreshed. This probably does mean doing some sort of find operation to locate the appropriate child in the new collection.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
