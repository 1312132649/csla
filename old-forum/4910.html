The specific issue is that I have a comboBox that needs to refresh its list based on the value within another text box. This seems like it would be&nbsp;a fairly common scenario so&nbsp;I feel like I'm missing something simple.</P>
<P>Thanks, Dennis</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, May 29, 2008</h2><P>You can handle the&nbsp;<FONT size=2>CurrentItemChanged</FONT> event on the bindingsource, though that won't tell you the specific property that was changed.</P>
<P>You can handle the PropertyChanged event on the business object itself, and that will provide you with the name of the property that changed (or a null or empty string if ALL properties should be considered changed).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dtabako replied on Thursday, May 29, 2008</h2><P>Thanks Rocky. I had made an attempt to handle PropertyChanged in my UI previously but I must have messed something up. Got it working now though. Thanks a lot.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>ctl_BindingSourceListChanged for your control and then analyze :</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>If</SPAN><SPAN> e.ListChangedType = System.ComponentModel.ListChangedType.ItemChanged <SPAN>AndAlso</SPAN> <SPAN>Not</SPAN> e.PropertyDescriptor <SPAN>Is</SPAN> <SPAN>Nothing</SPAN> <SPAN>Then</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN><SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from here on you can check e.PropertyDescriptor.Name, that give you name of property, and then apply your logic.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN><FONT color=#000000></FONT></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal></SPAN><SPAN>End If</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>

<P>That was the kind of thing I was trying to do after I messed up handling PropertyChanged on my UI. I was pretty sure there was a way to do it through the BindingSource I just couldn't find any examples. Since I fixed my issues with handling PropertyChanged and it works the way I want now, I'll probably stick with that. But I might give your way a try as well down the line.</P>
