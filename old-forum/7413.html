<p class=MsoNormal>Ok, I know Silverlight does not have reporting capabilities
and I am developing a system with numerous reports.&nbsp; I am utilizing SQL
Server Reporting Services and when I was initially going to develop the system
in ASP.NET, I noticed there was a MicrosoftReportViewer control that I could
drop into the page.<br>
<br>
If you have a Silverlight application, can you have a couple of pure aspx pages
in there that I could use for the reporting?&nbsp; Should I have a separate web
application specifically for reporting?&nbsp; Any feedback and answers or
suggestions and recomendations would be greatly appreciated.<br>

Looks like it is going to produce a nice end-user experience.<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
