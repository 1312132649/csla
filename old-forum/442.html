I'm now gonna look at how to do this with xstl with which I'm not familiar. <br /><br />I'd really appreciate it if some who aready has docs makes it available/posts it. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 29, 2006</h2><P>One of Magenic's consultants did find a non-standard version of ndoc that worked (with some effort he said) to create a chm file. I haven't had time to repeat what he did, and (honestly) I've been hoping that they'd get the new ndoc done soon so I could just use a supported tool...</P>
<P>So you know, you won't be able to replicated what ndoc does just by using xslt. They also use reflection against the assembly to get more information (or at least they did in .NET 1.x).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
