<P>I want whenever I create a new EditableRoot then IsDirty = false and IsNew= true;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Tuesday, April 17, 2007</h2><P>The standard CSLA behaviour is for a "new" object to be "dirty".&nbsp; This indicates that the object must be written to the database.</P>
<P>I would advise against changing this standard behaviour, since the CSLA framework uses the IsDirty flag internally to determine what happens when the Save() method is called.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Tuesday, April 17, 2007</h2>The IsDirty is how CSLA knows whether the object needs to be saved to the database.&nbsp; If the IsDirty = FALSE it will not be saved even you call a .Save().&nbsp; The IsNew flag lets you know whether this object was loaded from a database or newly created.&nbsp; It also directs the CSLA to call either a update or an insert.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Tuesday, April 17, 2007</h2>FWIW, my subclassed EditableRoot allows one to mark the object as clean - I don't think I'm the only one doing this. I like that you can create a new object, and if you don't change anything, it won't get saved. Like how Office docs work.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>phucphlq replied on Tuesday, April 17, 2007</h2><DIV class=ForumPostContentText id=ctl00_ctl01_bcr_ctl00___PostRepeater_ctl04_PostViewWrapper>Hi!</DIV>
<DIV class=ForumPostContentText><STRONG>Why do you want to save a new EditableRoot which does not change anything?</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV class=ForumPostContentText>Have you used MS Office, if you create a new doc and do not&nbsp;change anything, MS Office will not show question "Do you want to save the changes to Document1?".</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Wednesday, April 18, 2007</h2><P>I think the comparison&nbsp;of a busines object to a Word document might be stretching things a bit.&nbsp; But really, it depends on your application's specifics.</P>
<P>In the business software I've used, it&nbsp;would be very unusual to begin the process of adding a new entity and be able to just close the form and not get a warning.&nbsp; I would consider that a severe flaw, in fact.</P>
<P>This is somewhat a personal preference, but what would you do for cases where adding (and saving) a new item with just the default values is allowed?&nbsp; If you change this behavior there would be no way for the framework to differentiate between a new item that should be saved and one that should just be ignored.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
