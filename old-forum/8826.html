Business.Server.dll and Business.Client.dll for example?</p>
<p>I have an SL4 (all the latest bits from everyone)&nbsp;demo project that works when both assemblies have the same name. If I change them as above, the SL app can talk to the client side business object, but it fails when DataPortal.BeginFetch is called with the following error. I presume that this means that the data portal cannot find the &quot;matching&quot; business assembly on the server side since in fact, it does not have the same name.</p>
<p>--------------------------<br />Message from webpage<br />---------------------------<br />Could not load file or assembly &#39;Business.Client, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null&#39; or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.<br />---------------------------<br />OK&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />---------------------------</p>
<p>Can Csla be configured to work with the above naming scheme? I&#39;m thinking its necessary for mstest code coverage analysis to work (because I got a name conflict on those two assemblies when VS tried to instrument the assemblies. Note that that was when the entire application was in a single solution.</p>
<p>I suppose if I split the application into client-side and server-side solutions built into separate output folders that I VS would be happy with the identical assembly names since they&#39;d be in different output folders.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, April 21, 2010</h2><p>No, absolutely not. The BinaryFormatter, NetDataContractSerializer and MobileFormatter (the three serializers used by CSLA) all require the same assembly qualified type name for the types on the client and server - and that includes the assembly name.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
