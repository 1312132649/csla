I still seem to be barking up the wrong tree.&nbsp; Any suggestions for additional things to try would be appreciated.&nbsp; I'm really excited about CSLA from reading the book, but I feel it's only logical that I've got to get this sample app to run before I can do anything else.&nbsp; Thanks,<br><br>Dave<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
