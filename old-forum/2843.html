<P>One thought I have is to load up the parent objects and then have each parent object know how to cause itself to load child objects in separate queries to the database.&nbsp; What I'm afraid of with this is that if the parent objects are being loaded&nbsp;by iterating through a&nbsp;datareader then I'll have to open a separate connection (and close it) for each collection of child objects.&nbsp; If I load up 100 parent objects that would be a total of 201 connections being opened and closed. </P>
<P>I suppose I could preload a list of IDs and iterate through those IDs loading the individual parent object and subsequent child collections all at once on a per parent object basis.&nbsp; I could do that with one connection but 100 separate hits to the database.</P>
<P>Ideas?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, May 10, 2007</h2>You may want to look at the <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?area=11&amp;id=65c98c98-f0e0-477d-b45b-7a1e7d5768ee">DeepData sample </A>from my website, where I illustrate how to use a top-down technique to do this in a pretty efficient manner.
