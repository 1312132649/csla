I think I will need more help getting this project running than the document provides. I've searched the book and have not come across anything useful in this respect. I'd like to run the application along with the book so I can better understand while trying to create my own app. Please help.<br><br>CSLA.NET 3.6<br><br>Thanks.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
