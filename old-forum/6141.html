So far, so good. <br><br>However, I have hit a bit of a brick wall as to the next step, which is to do with playback of the media itself. We have a silverlight media player which, at present, accesses the media file and then reads the markers into a client-side list. </font></font><font face="Tahoma"><font size="2">This list has to then be looped
through to match up with the relevant elements from the XML, so that we
can display a transcript of each section to the user.<br><br></font></font><font face="Tahoma"><font size="2">Obviously this breaks encapsulation and should be put into a business object too, but I am not sure as to how, as the media file is on a different server altogether to the XML file - my thinking is that I should use a factory object, via which I can talk to the media servervia WCF and retrieve a serialized data access object, containing the list of markers? Or is there a different, simpler pattern I should follow?<br><br>Thanks for any help.<br></font></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, January 13, 2009</h2><P>It sounds like the media server exposes some service you call to get the markers?</P>
<P>I'd create a business object that uses a local data portal to call that service to get the markers.</P>
<P>CSLA .NET for Silverlight doesn't have a RunLocal attribute, but the data portal accepts a parameter where you can tell it to run in local mode for a given call/object&nbsp;- so you get the same result.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
