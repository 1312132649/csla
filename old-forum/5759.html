<P>I'm wondering if it would be possible to have a CslaLight application that did not require the use of a web server. Thinking of just embedding the .xap in a .html page. Object data storage would be in isolated storage. So this would be an offline app that's hosted in a browser.</P>
<P>Haven't tried it yet - anyone know if this just plain wouldn't work?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>You might also look at the Mesh SDK, because you can host SL apps in Mesh, and they can run when offline - the data gets synced into the Mesh store when you go online next.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
