<P>Windows Forms data binding doesn't like it when one object is being managed by more than one bindingsource. So if your object (even indirectly through the list) is being managed by the bindingsource on one form, and then again by a bindingsource on the modal form, you'll have trouble.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
