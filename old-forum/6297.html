So when a customer is displayed on a form, the user needs to make sure everything is correct prior to saving, which is of course normal and works fine.</P>
<P>Now I need to provide a batch way of updating customer BOs. The user provides the customer identifier along with key/value pairs for properties who's values should be updated. What I would like to achieve is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Trigger validation (mandatory fields, max length fields &amp; custom validations) only for the properties that have been changed.</LI>
<LI>If unchanged properties violate some other predefined type/instance rules, ignore them and continue with saving. The main reason for this is because there is a lot of bad data in the DB for which there is not much I or the users can do about.</LI></UL>
<P>Is there any elegant way of achieving this by reusing my customer BO? Should I have a different BO? If so how would I achieve that?</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, January 30, 2009</h2>Well, that should happen normally as the user is modifying values.&nbsp; Changing a property only runs rules tied to that property.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Friday, January 30, 2009</h2><P>Maybe I'm missing something, but presumably you explicitly are calling ValidationRules.CheckRules() only for a new object. For an existing object, the individual rules aren't called unless the property for the rule is changed. </P>
<P>So, I would think this would work.</P>
<P>1. Load customer BO using identifier. Should be valid at this point since no rules have been checked. </P>
<P>2. Enumerate your key/value pairs and call property setter in BO for each present value (this will fire the rules for the properties as they are changed).</P>
<P>3. After setting all the changed properties, object will be valid or not. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triplea replied on Tuesday, February 03, 2009</h2><P>Thanks both it was my mistake I was calling ValidationRules.CheckRules() on my base class for this app and forgot in the process... Silly user error!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
