<p>My objective here is to have total control of&nbsp;the behavior. I can save/delete per object or even save/delete all objects.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 04, 2010</h2><p>Really if you don&#39;t want autosave you might be using the wrong base class. ERLB is all about autosave...</p>
<p>But if you want to try and make it work, override the save item method and make it a no-op until you want it to really run.</p>
<p>Please be aware that you are clearly outside the scope of the intended usage of ERLB - which is narrowly defined as supporting datagrid binding where an object is automatically saved when the user leaves a row in the datagrid.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>brembot replied on Saturday, June 05, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Rocky for you quick reply. I want to achieve something but i haven&#39;t figure it out how to do this. I&nbsp;always used&nbsp;EditableRootCollection and EditableChildObject a lot. The limitation of this object is you cannot save&nbsp;per object but rather save the collection of object. It come to my mind that i need the&nbsp;per object saving as well as the saving of collection of objects. What business object am i going to used? Is it EditableRootCollection and EditableRoot? </p>

<p>It is specifically designed to be bound to a datagrid, and to respond to the data binding methods from the datagrid so it knows to automatically update the objects.</p>
<p>If you are binding it to a datagrid, it will be challenging to block those behaviors. Again, you <i>might</i> be able to block those behaviors by overriding the save item method in your collection class.</p>
<p>If you are not binding the objects to a UI using data binding, then it is relatively easy to control the process, because YOU need to call the save item method explicitly.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>brembot replied on Sunday, June 06, 2010</h2><p>Hello Rocky, </p>
<p>Thanks a lot. I think overriding the save item method is the way to go.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Marlon</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jtrotman replied on Monday, October 08, 2012</h2><p>I know this is an old thread - but I just came across it.&nbsp; Are you saying Editable Root List Base but meaning Dynamic List Base?</p>
<p>Looking in ebook #2, it seems to be the Dynamic Root List stereotype that you&#39;re describing (designed for use with a datagrid, members saved independently).&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Editable Root List stereotype is described as &quot;change many child objects, and they&#39;ll be saved to the database as a batch, not one at a time.&quot;</p>
<p>Not meaning to be nit-picky - just wanting to make sure I&#39;m not misunderstanding something.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, October 08, 2012</h2><p>Terminology has changed and become more refined over time.</p>
<p>You are correct - BLB does batch saves of child objects, DLB does individual saves of root objects.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
