<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>glenntoy replied on Monday, April 16, 2007</h2>If you are using Csla authentication or table based security you might want to include on creating a new csla class project for Security (like in ProjectTracker.Library under Security folder). If you do already have then just reference the existing project. I'm not quite sure if that is what you meant in #5<br><br>In #09, this is case to case basis, what if you already have an existing database in a development server? <br><br>#12. I think you can skip enterpriseservicehostvb if your not using enterprise services. <br>#13. configuration in application config (eg. client-server, .NET remoting, enterprise services)<br><br>Maybe you also need to include on how you organize your business objects using namespaces.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Tuesday, April 17, 2007</h2>Thanks, I haven't got as far as even thinking about the security side of things yet, but I'll add that in.&nbsp; <br><br>My #5 point was just trying to define a naming convention for the Business Object library, so in my example, I would call the new project for the business objects "Membership.library".<br><br>Point 9 was with reference to the CSLA sample project having a PTData project, I haven't grokked the purpose of this project yet, so it was a reminder to myself to dig into it some more.<br><br>Thanks for explaining the enterpriseservicehostvb reference and the suggestion for step 13.<br><br>The purpose of this step by step guide is to help me follow the same steps when creating a new project (I tend to develop lots of different applications and won't be working in .NET and CSLA all the time so I need guidlines like this to get my brain back into gear).<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Tuesday, April 17, 2007</h2>Hi again,<br><br>your reference to the templates has led me to investigate them some more.&nbsp; How do I use these in starting a new project (please forgive me as I am pretty new to Visual Studio and .NET in general)?<br><br>Do I just copy the files from the template directory into a new directory and then go from there?<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>glenntoy replied on Tuesday, April 17, 2007</h2>At first I used to cut and paste and just change the class name. But then I felt that it was time consuming to do it everytime (search and replace) I create a business object. <br><br>So what I did, is to explore on creating code snippets in VB.NET (<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/ms789085.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/ms789085.aspx</a>). To give you a little idea on creating code snippets you can visit on this screencast (<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=295242">http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=295242</a>).<br><br>Now, if you have CodeSmith code generator, I think you can download the code generators for CSLA in CSLA Contrib. I don't know if it does have VB.NET version.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Wednesday, April 18, 2007</h2>Thanks for that.<br><br>I have been using CSLAGen to generate code, but found that I wasn't understanding the underlying code enough so went back to basics which has helped somewhat.&nbsp; As soon as I'm comfortable with the basics I'll look at using the code snippets and generators.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
