<p>I&#39;m curious has to recommendations for a busy indicator for when an async rule is running.&nbsp; As it stands now I have the BXF handling a locking of the screen and presentation of status messages when retrieving records or saving records.&nbsp; This is done using <span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;">Bxf.</span></span><span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;">Shell</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;">.Instance.ShowStatus</span></span></p>
<p>I&#39;m a bit puzzled on how to approach this with an async business rule.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Maybe changing the status on the screen while an async rule is running sort of defeats the purpose of having async rules?&nbsp;&nbsp; How have others handled this?</span></span></span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, February 02, 2013</h2><p>I typically use a busy indicator on a per-field basis to show that an async rule is running.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t want to block the whole UI because an async rule is running for one property, but you probably do want the user to know that something is happening related to that property.</p>
<p>The PropertyInfo control (or PropertyStatus) provides that per-property busy information.</p>
<p>Also, the IsSavable property on the object automatically goes to false as long as there are any outstanding async rules, so that part is typically handled through binding as well.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
