<p>&nbsp; [Flags]<br />&nbsp; public enum RelationshipTypes<br />&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LazyLoad,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PrivateField,<br />&nbsp; }</p>
<p>I added the the bit values and this appeared to clear up the strange values for myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp; [Flags]<br />&nbsp; public enum RelationshipTypes<br />&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None = 0,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child = 1,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LazyLoad = 2,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PrivateField = 4,<br />&nbsp; }</p>
<p>Now this problem did not affect what I was working on, but I thought it may help others if they are having issues with RelationshipTypes.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>Looks like a bug - but I&#39;ve forwarded it to Jonny so he can take a look.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>Yes, thanks for reporting this - it is a bug.</p>
