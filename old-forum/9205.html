<p>I find the book&#39;s explanation to be a little ambiguous on this point.&nbsp; Page 276 says &quot;...BusinessBase includes code to handle the PropertyChanged or ListChanged events raised by <strong>any</strong> child objects.&quot; [emphasis added]&nbsp; But the previous paragraphs are talking specifically about child lists.</p>
<p>Anyway, it doesn&#39;t seem to be doing it for me.&nbsp; If that&#39;s normal, then I need to wire to the PropertyChanged of the child object myself.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>DanB replied on Wednesday, July 14, 2010</h2><p>I had a brain black hole and was just using the standard root editable object as a child.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
