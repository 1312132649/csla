Any views.<br>Questionnaire 30 questions.&nbsp; 10 questions or so have multiple options e.g. which sports do you like - followed by 10-15 check boxes - one or all can be checked.<br><br>So do I create a child table (ApplicantID, QuestionID, Selected) (and BO) to hold these answers types or simply add&nbsp; these (10-15) answers, as individual yes/no type fields, to my main table (tblApplicantAnswers).<br><br>Other info - this is a one-off type project.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Richard<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, January 17, 2008</h2><P>When I get to design the tables I am firmly in the child table approach. </P>
<P>This is because adding another row is trivial and there are no code changes.</P>
<P>But I have to deal with the yes/no fields in the main table quite often.</P>
<P>Whenever a new one is added there is a lot of code to change. And a new one is added every time we develop the next version of the app! </P>
<P>So even for a "one-off" project I vote for the child table aproach. When you re-visit it in a year to expand it then you can thank me. &lt;g&gt;</P>
