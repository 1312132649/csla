<p>We&#39;re using CSLA 2 with VB.Net 2005.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#39;m able to open a child record and update the child and the parent after the first save, but if a user changes something else, and wants to save again, the child gets updated but the parent doesn&#39;t, so it has a result of not updating the record in the database.</p>
<p>Is there a way for me to push the updated properties to the parent?&nbsp; I&nbsp;saw some post about the OnChildChanged event, but how do I use it in vb.net and where do I put it so I can trigger it when my child is changed.&nbsp; In all my child properties I have the <span style="font-size:x-small;">PropertyHasChanged, but it doesn&#39;t seem to update my parent and it&#39;s with the parent that I&#39;m doing the save.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-small;">Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Remember, I&#39;m still new at CSLA, so the more info the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-small;">Thanks</span></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
