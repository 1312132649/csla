<P>The only place you can easily plug compression into the data portal is with the Silverlight data portal. I didn't bother to add those hooks in the .NET side, because you can just go get a compressed WCF binding instead.</P>

I believe someone posted a solution for this.  If you are to write your own, then...<br />You can write a custom behavior extension.  You would need to implement a few interfaces that WCF defines: IEndpointBehavior, IDispatchMessageInspector, IClientMessageInspector, IServiceBehavior.  You class would need to inherit from an Attribute as well.<br /><br />IDispatchMessageInspector.AfterReceiveRequest you would decompress a message.  In IDispatchMessageInspector.BeforeSendReply you would compress the message.  In IClientMessageInspector you would do the opposite.<br /><br />In IEndpointBehavior.ApplyClientBehavior you would need to add "this" as another message inspector.  Same with ApplyDispatchBehavior.<br /><br />For compress/decompress you can just use any compression library.  In the actual Compress routine you would need to create new message, copy headers from the old message, create new header and add it to headers collection. <br /><br />You can probably find some sample code on MSDN if you search for those interfaces.<br /><br />The last step is to add new behavior to .  node in web/app.config.  Then you refer to this extension in  node.<br /><br />Sorry I cannot provide more detailed info.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: DocJames [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Saturday, September 19, 2009 12:28 PM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] RE: Compression?

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Using WcfBfProxy with compressed binding is almost
