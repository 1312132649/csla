I'm a newbie though so I really don't know if this is right. Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong on this point.</P>
<P>We have had fairly good success at starting with an EditableRootlListBase, binding it to a grid control that supports binding (e.g. DevExpress XtraGrid), and then letting the ERLB object manage all the editing. </P>
<P>I've also taken an entire BusinessListBase object and bound it to a form, calling the edit functions only on the list itself rather than the child objects in the list and that has also worked. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jurjen replied on Wednesday, September 10, 2008</h2><P>Hello,</P>
<P><BR>I'm using DevExpress XtraGrid (8.2.1) in my windows-application and am having some problems with child-collections. Editing is working just fine, but when adding a new child to the childcollection, strange things happen, the first keystroke (or selected date in dateedit) is discarded, while adding items in a similar fashion to a EditableRootCollection works just fine.</P>
<P>I was just wondering if anyone here had maybe solved this problem already, so I won't have to. <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /></P>
<P><BR>TIA,<BR>Jurjen.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
