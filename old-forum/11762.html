<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have implemented Business List Object in DataGrid on Silverlight with business rules and then when an Validation Error happened The SIlverlight Data Grid has a red border and error message displayed at the bottom of DataGrid. It&#39;s Nice and I Iike that.</p>
<p>BUT, when I implement on WPF I just got a red border but there is no error message displayed at the bottom.</p>
<p>Could someone explained about these ? and Give me any sugesstions ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For The record : I use CSLA 4.3.13</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot</p>

You should not expect them to work the same, and you will need to learn how to style the WPF control to get anything but the default red border.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
