In my case I have a base class that sets up some rules (one being for an elevation property). Several classes derive from it. In one class I don&#39;t want the result of the elevation rules to cause the object to become invalid.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, July 26, 2013</h2><p>A couple of options:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Override IsValid method in your BO to exclude this property from the BrokenRules check (field will still have broken rule tho)</li>
<li>Rewrite your rule to check for som condition / other field as to whether it is active or not.&nbsp;</li>
</ol></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
