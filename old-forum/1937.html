Obviously the DetailsView is set to Edit mode, hence the Update and Cancel buttons showing after selecting a project from the ProjectList page.&nbsp; Selectng the New Project link from the ProjectList page will correctly show the Insert and Cancel buttons.&nbsp; But the book (page 557) mentions that "if the user clicks the link in the DetailsView control to delete the project, the DeleteObject event is raised".&nbsp; How will this event ever be raised if the button never shows up?&nbsp; Is this just a&nbsp;theoretical statement?&nbsp;</P>
<P>What is the newbie missing here?&nbsp; Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sam replied on Monday, December 11, 2006</h2><P>u can delete project from projectlist page and see&nbsp; how the deleteobject event is raised.login in by pm</P>
