<p>I&#39;m using&nbsp;a CSLA MobileList containing CriteriaBase derived objects.</p>
<p>I need the list to serialize from SL3 to .NET.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed that if the list contains simple objects like String that the serialization/deseriaization process succeeds however if I insert CriteriaBase derived objects in to the list I get serialization errors.</p>
<p>I should add that my MobileList is a managed backed field on a CriteriaBase derived object.</p>
<p>I should also add that all properties in this scenario are managed backed fields.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve noticed the same issue with MobileDictionary when inserting Critiera objects as opposed to simple objects.</p>
<p>Is it possible to insert CriteriaBase derived objects in to a MobileList and have CSLA serialize the list correctly or can it only handle simple types?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
