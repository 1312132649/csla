<P>I am trying to implement the CSLA 2.0's ReadWriteAuthorization Extender control in .Net 1.1 version.</P>
<P>I created the control and when I drag and drop the control onto my form, I got an error </P>
<P>"<FONT color=#ff0000>An exception occured while trying to create an instance of CSLA.Security.ReadWriteAuthorization. The exception was "Constructor on type&nbsp;CSLA.Security.ReadWriteAuthorization not found&nbsp;"."</FONT></P>
<P>The code in the book says we have to have a constructor of the format. </P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>public</FONT><FONT size=2> ReadWriteAuthorization(IContainer container)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>Think this suppressed the default constructor. I then added a default constructor and I am able to add it to my form.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Just want to make sure, if this idea will work for 1.1 version of .Net. I don't want to spend couple of days trying to implement it and figure out it would not work. If any one have any experience in this, please let me know about it.</P>
<P>Thank You</P>
