<P>What OS are you using?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>joel replied on Wednesday, January 17, 2007</h2><P>Using Windows XP Professional sp2 with IIS installed locally.</P>
<P>Thanks for the reply, I was afraid I had no choice but to use integrated security.&nbsp; I'll keep looking for the reason it's not working as anonymous.</P>
