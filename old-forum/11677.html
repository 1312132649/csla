<p>It looks like <b>EnterpriseServices </b>proxy and <b>Remoting </b>proxy have been removed and <b>Mobile </b>proxy has been added.</p>
<p>Is there some information available about the new Mobile proxy? When should we use it (if at all) and how is it different from the WcfProxy?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, November 06, 2012</h2><p>The MobileProxy uses the MobileFormatter and pre 4.5 was only available for Silverlight/WP which is now also available for .NET applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IE: You can have a more common codebase and N-tier server for SL, .NET and WP. <br />Previously you would have one proxy endpoint for SL/WP and another endpoint for .NET.</p>
<p>The MobileProxy uses another contract envelope (and server side proxy) and has a better Exception message to provide error message to client (and will not serialize the actual Exception).</p>
<p>In all essence the MobileProxy is a NET implementation of the pre 4.5 Silverlight class Csla.DataPortalClient.WcfProxy

<p>Would it be safe to make the statement that MobileProxy the preferred default formatter for CSLA 4.5 when using SL/WP/RT?.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 07, 2012</h2><p>Not just the default, but the only option unless you want to write your own. The Microsoft serializers (BinaryFormatter and NDCS) don&#39;t exist on those platforms so they aren&#39;t an option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we&#39;ve done is made MobileFormatter an option on .NET where it wasn&#39;t before. This should support partial trust scenarios like on a multi-tenant web server.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
