If certain parts of the overview cannot be changed, thats fine... you can still have read-only properties on a BusinessBase subclass, if for example it contains a subrecord that needs to have editing capability.<br /><br />HTH<br />Andy</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Holger replied on Wednesday, August 19, 2009</h2><P>Hi Andy,</P>
<P>thanks for your answer. I agree with your solution separating these two scenarios.</P>
<P>We are not sure at the moment, if we want to allow editing data in the overview. There are different kinds of articles with a certain state in the overview&nbsp;list. It seems to me that we have to implement a difficult state management for the edit scenario.</P>
<P>Bye </P>
