That turned out to be mostly an exercise in how Windows DataBinding works with CSLA child collections and grids.&nbsp; (The DevExpress grid does indeed work <EM>slightly</EM> different than the standard Windows one but that was only the last 10% of solving the problem.)</P>
<P>Their layout control is way cool.&nbsp; If you want you can go as far as allowing users to customize the layout of the forms.&nbsp; But in any event it makes creating nice layouts a snap.&nbsp; Similar to the new layout controls in .NET 2.0, but these actually work in a useful way.</P>
<P>I got their whole suite with source code for the reason you state - by the time you buy the second product individually the price is the same.</P>
<P>The controls are also null friendly, but I imagine that's not so unique.&nbsp; Don't need SmartDate at all.</P>

<P>The only thing I don;t like about infragistics is there controls seem to make my screen draw slowley.&nbsp; If I bind to a standard MS grid the screens show up instantly, but the infragistics stuffs sometimes make the apps look a little sluggish, i.e. you can see the different parts drawing (a bit annoying)&nbsp; &lt;-- has anyone else had this, I get this on my xeon development machine which&nbsp;is even more annoying.</P>
<P>Even the infragistics&nbsp;text box controls when binded to objects seems to be a little sluggish when tabbing through them.&nbsp; Nothing bad but its like a half second delay or something that is only just noticiable but there and annoying (Probably just me, been too anal about things&nbsp;:) ).</P>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The good.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Love how easy it is to get a common look throughout the app.&nbsp; Even user controlsm you&nbsp;design in component library with automatically use the skin of the app using them.&nbsp; And the skins are easy, but time consuming, to create.&nbsp; The default and bonus skins are pretty nice.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There is a pivot grid that allows you to&nbsp;do a&nbsp;poor mans version of OLAP. Just watch your users&nbsp;grin when you show them that.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The controls have a ton of built in functionality and integrate wonderfully.&nbsp; An example of this is printing a&nbsp;grid. It is so simple yet the user, with no work from you, can add a header, footer, adjust the margins add "page x of&nbsp;y" counts, water marks and so much more.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The reporting control is pretty darn good and there is an end user report designer that is a part of the package.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Never used it but there is some ORM stuff included.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As other have said Refactor! and CodeRush are very powerful and after using them awhile going without hurts. (But they do have some quirks that hinder more than help.&nbsp; Those things can be modified or shut off.)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The schedualing suite is pretty nice as well.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For a small extra you can get the source as well. (And this is important, see below.)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>Finally compared to the others it is rather cheap.&nbsp; You get the full suite including the royalty report designer for what others charge just&nbsp;for the report&nbsp;and designer combo.&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>THE BAD</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Suport is pretty bad.&nbsp; It takes quite awhile for them to get back and often the answer is "You need to send us your project so we can figure this out."&nbsp; I don't like sending them my source. Other companies I have used have been able to help me without my project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Some documentation is good some is lacking.&nbsp; It has been getting better but the schedualing stuff still has alot of blank pages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I get the impression that they really only understand databinding to datatables.&nbsp; Their controls work with CSLA based objects and collections but when seeking support and describing a problem the support personel don't seem to understand why I would be doing so much databinding with BO's.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This above&nbsp;is why the source code is so valuable.&nbsp; So you can fix it your self. The source is actually pretty easy to understand and very uniform so this is easier than you might think.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This last one really drives me nuts.&nbsp; THEY DO NOT HAVE A GOOD REPLACMENT FOR THE DEFAULT COMBO BOX CONTROL.&nbsp; The one they have you can't just bind to a datasource and then set the display/value members. This frustrates me to no end because in the middle of all the beutifully skinned controls I have these plain window combo boxes.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For Webforms&nbsp;I am&nbsp;liking the really like&nbsp;telerik stuff.&nbsp; Have not used it much but early testing seems promising.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Wednesday, January 10, 2007</h2><P>That reminds me of one of the biggest reasons I leaned towards Infragistics in the first place - and have gone back: One purchase and I have everything I need for both Windows and Web apps.&nbsp; You can count on 3 updates a year, so the products are constantly keeping pace and they have been incredibly quick at implementing the new stuff.&nbsp; They had a version of the MS Band control out around the same time MS actually released Office 2k7.&nbsp; And, for a little extra cash, you can have the source code which I have found incredibly helpful when trying to understand how things work - especially the client-side features.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The first problem is that it would require extra work to get it to look like a combo box. I know that can be overcome but I spend money on 3rd party control to avoid extra work.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And as far as preventing binding of the GUID,<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>that is also just extra work in a whole bunch of places.&nbsp; To avoid this work we put thought up front to what a user does and does not need to see. We do this so that the GUI developer can focus on design and usability, not what fields should be hidden.&nbsp; That logic, to me, definitely falls in the realm of 'middle tier business rules'. &nbsp; Again spending money on a third party control should mean less work for me.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But there are other reasons.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>We also have allot of runtime generated forms that given a root object will build themselves.&nbsp; There are rare cases where a GUID should be seen by the user. So knowing when and when not to show a GUID becomes more work than I care to do.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And we have more than a handful of collections that contain objects which cannot be uniquely identified by any of the fields.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Some of them are classes that use containment/aggregation of two or more other classes.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>These BO's<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>don't have field(s) that uniquely identify them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There are some places where the collections have objects whose IDs are the same. But still they are different objects and must be treated differently.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>An example of this is when we find a concurrency problem.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The object that was previously loaded and modified is checked against the object freshly loaded from the DB and the user is choosing which one to use.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>"Objects are defined by their behavior and not data".<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Following that I have found that often there is no data that uniquely identifies an object.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I can only think of one or two places where I care what data is displayed/chosen by the user.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>ALL I care about is what object(s) the user has selected.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Behavior takes over after that.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And in the end I find it absolutely mind boggling that with all the work they put into their controls they fail to have one that mimics one of the most highly used controls in windows forms.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>razorkai replied on Friday, January 12, 2007</h2><P>pelinville</P>
<P>To respond to your points, even if we are straying a little off topic from the original question...</P>
<P><EM>The first problem is that it would require extra work to get it to look like a combo box. I know that can be overcome but I spend money on 3rd party control to avoid extra work.</EM></P>
<P>It takes me&nbsp;only a few&nbsp;seconds to set up a LookupEdit, and the extra functionallity the control provides makes this someting I can bear.&nbsp; </P>

<P>I have to agree on all points with razor.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I didn't like the LookupEdit at first but now that I understand it I love it.&nbsp; I have never felt like it was terribly costly to make it work however I wanted, once I figured out how to do so (which I agree takes some up-front effort).</P>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Infragistics and componentOne did not have that limitation when I used them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>But I like the lookupEdit for what it does, it just doesn't do what I want.&nbsp;I use it in many places because of what it does.&nbsp;The problem is they do not have a control that does what I need.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There still no way to know what object is currently selected if there is no field or combination of fields that uniquely identify the object. They have a number&nbsp;of list type controls that do this. They can't have a drop down that can do this?&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This is bad, bad, bad.&nbsp; One of CSLAs purposes is to help developers use&nbsp;OOP principles.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp;OOP principle that says every object should have a&nbsp;Primary Key.&nbsp; That is more of a database principle.&nbsp;&nbsp;So to use one of their controls I have to make sure I implement a database principle in an object?&nbsp; Bad, bad, bad.&nbsp; Since when should the GUI dictate how the BO's are designed?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>At any rate I do feel that "looks" or how/what data is displayed is&nbsp;often a function of the middle tier. In the case of the GUID I would guess that it would be rare that a user would request a seemingly random string 32 characters long.&nbsp; These types of things are usually included because it is needed by some underlying technology, not business needs.&nbsp; The middle tier should shield users&nbsp;of the BOs&nbsp;from purely technological requirements. No?</DIV>

<P>Hi pelinville</P>
<P>I use the devexpress suite with the Csla and it works perfectly for me.&nbsp; I am curious about your lookupedit problems.&nbsp; Regarding the first one, what is it that looks different that your users don't like?&nbsp; You can make&nbsp;the drop down&nbsp;look more normal with the Properties.Columns property.&nbsp; Here you can set it to only show one column and then set ShowHeader to false to hide the column headers.</P>
<P>I don't understand why you mark your Ids with not bindable.&nbsp; I understand that guids are ugly, but you don't have to display them if you don't want to.&nbsp; All the controls allow you to configure what properties of an object get displayed.&nbsp; If you remove this attribute you can then set the ValueMember to the Id property and use the EditValue property to determine the currently selected item.</P>
<P>HTH.</P>

<P></div></BLOCKQUOTE></P>
<P>I think there's maybe no point in going back and forth on the DevExpress control any further, but I for those reading this more generally I wanted to state that I personally think this is not a very good measure of the value of a 3rd party tool.&nbsp; I buy a tool to build a better product, in all the ways I measure better - more performant, more user-friendly, more maintainable, etc.&nbsp; It&nbsp;almost always&nbsp;requires "extra work" to make a better product, with a 3rd party tool or not.</P>
<P>I've never used the full suite from any other vendor, so I honestly can't say A is better than B.&nbsp; But I'd say the DevExpress LayoutControl is so powerful that the relatively minor cost of tweaking the LookupEdit compared to the efficiency of the LayoutControl is not enough to sway me.</P>
<P>In other words, my first paragraph above&nbsp;in this response is not meant to pick a fight, but rather to suggest that I've found <EM>any</EM>&nbsp;tool you buy is going to have limitations and quirks you have to discover the hard way.&nbsp; The question is always one of simple cost-benefit analysis.&nbsp; Asking the question "which suite gives me zero extra work working with CSLA" is perhaps the wrong question.&nbsp; Food for thought.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Friday, January 12, 2007</h2><P>re: &gt;&gt; This last one really drives me nuts.&nbsp; THEY DO NOT HAVE A GOOD REPLACMENT FOR THE DEFAULT COMBO BOX CONTROL.&nbsp; The one they have you can't just bind to a datasource and then set the display/value members. This frustrates me to no end because in the middle of all the beutifully skinned controls I have these plain window combo boxes.&nbsp;&lt;&lt;</P>
<P>Have you tried their LookUpEdit control?&nbsp; It behaves as you seem to be describing here.&nbsp; Bind to the EditValue property and it works pretty well for me.</P>
<P>re:&gt;&gt; the thread subject in general....</P>
<P>I like the DevExpress stuff, too.&nbsp; Their forum participants are pretty helpful, but support is a bit slow sometimes.</P>
<P>The major benefit is that you have a controls suite AND a report tool all in the same package and there's pretty good consistency in all of it.&nbsp; </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>NoviceCoder replied on Thursday, January 11, 2007</h2><P>Microsoft uses Xceed controls in their latest Office products.</P>

<P>For support matters, I can say that I am also very satisfied that I bought these products. Most Issues are solved within a day, sometimes it takes 2 days. I asked them CSLA related questions, and they are very aware of the existence of CSLA. </P>
<P>If you describe your problem properly, you don't need to send them your project or anything. For most common Issues they allready have sample project. Just use the right description of your problem. You can search their knowledge base for known issues. Again, use the right keywords for your problem.</P>
<P>For databinding; You use a bindingsource anyway. And DevExpress works great with the bindingsource. No Issues here.</P>
<P>As for any product, including CSLA; You should read the&nbsp;documentation first&nbsp;before you&nbsp;start working with the product.</P>
