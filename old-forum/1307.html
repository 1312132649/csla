The functionalities it provides are:<br><br>-Display a tree structure with the errors that your whole BO structure contains.<br>-Supports the renaming of objects on the fly.<br>-Supports all 3 severities of rules with their corresponding icons.<br>-Recognizes the adding/removing of child, grandchild, etc items to your structure.<br>-Fires an event (on double click) that you can easily handle to point the user to the correct property / item in a collection.<br><br>I hope you find it useful! You can get it at the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=CSLAcontrib">CodePlex site</a>.<br><br><a href="http://img62.imageshack.us/my.php?image=errortreeviewun3.png">Here's a screenshot</a> for your viewing pleasure...<br><br>

That looks really nice and it's easy to create. The users can hide, drag or close the error window, just like in visual studio.<br>The nicest thing is that if you have 20k children, you can easily point the user to the one that has problems.<br><br>Plans for the future include:<br>-Choose what severities you want to show.<br>-Change icons or disable them.<br>-Provide a way to indicate which item is being edited to the tree, so that the user will be able to easily find the issues of the item being edited.<br><br><br>I might be missing some stuff, but that's mainly it.<br><br><br>Andrés</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Pavel replied on Friday, May 25, 2007</h2>I try to set ValidationRules for SomeValue property (if SomeValue=0 then message should popup) and it works for me showing message only for the first Child or GrandChild in GridView&nbsp; controls.<br><br>What might be the problem ?<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Friday, May 25, 2007</h2>Did you take a look at the sample app?<br>What's your object hierarchy like (class name &amp; object type)?<br><br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Pavel replied on Saturday, May 26, 2007</h2>Andres,<br>I am using the sample that provided with ErrorTreeView.<br><br>Thanks,<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vaidal replied on Tuesday, May 29, 2007</h2>I can´t find the source...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Wednesday, May 30, 2007</h2>Well, I don't know where the cslacontrib section of the forum went... but anyway:<br>http://www.codeplex.com/CSLAcontrib/SourceControl/DownloadSourceCode.aspx?changeSetId=6528<br><br>In there you should be able to find the source.<br><br>Pavel, I just tried it with the latest csla. The only issue I could find is that the rule methods were not static, so the sample app crashes on load. Anyway, changing those methods to "Shared" fixed it and i see that the tree behaves appropriately...<br><br>What exactly do you see?<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Wednesday, May 30, 2007</h2>Pavel:<br>Duh! sorry, I see your problem is related to what I just posted.

I didn't do any research, but I don't suppose it would be too hard...<br>Just loop through the grid's Columns collection and find the one bound to the same property. I suppose the grid has a way of focusing a specific column... but I never really tried that...<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Pavel replied on Friday, June 01, 2007</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>xal:</strong></div><div>What do you mean with this??<br>&gt;&gt; "e.Severity was changed to Csla.Validation.RuleSeverity.Error or ignored at all."<br><br>Andrés<br></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>ErrorTreeView would still show a message, but GridView will be without exclamation sign in case Information or Warning level. <br>That is it -:)<br><br> <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr></table></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vsp replied on Thursday, June 21, 2007</h2><P>I have downloaded the code but it is VB.

You could still reference the compiled dll from your c# project and use it though...<br>Just make sure you compile both your app and the treeview against the same version of csla.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
