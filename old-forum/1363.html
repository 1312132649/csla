However, all of a sudden it does not seem to like my object (the same one as I have successfully bound with before).</P>
<P>Here's what happens: after selecting 'Object' from the wizard screen, it then allows you to add new objects as a datasource or use existing ones. I choose to add a new one and the select my object. Once I have chosen an inidividual object from the tree, the wizard screen justs disappears - no error message and no new data source added.</P>
<P>Strangely, if I try the same exercise with the CSLA.dll, I have no problems. My objects build fine, so I am clueless as to what the problem is.</P>
<P>Would be very grateful for any suggestions.</P>
