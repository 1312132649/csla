<p>Code:</p>
<p>var item = myList.AddNew();</p>
<p>Do all items in a BusinessListBase object need to be marked as children?&nbsp; My list object is not a child object so why does it require all of its items to be children?</p>
<p>Confused.</p>
<p>Tks for any assistance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>WillWayne replied on Tuesday, February 15, 2011</h2><p>For a collection of Root items, try using&nbsp;the DynamicListBase&lt;T&gt;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, February 15, 2011</h2><p>BusinessListBase reuires that the items in the list are child object of the BLB. </p>
<p>Your BLB may be a root or child -&nbsp; but all items in the list must be child objects and cannot be saved in their own &quot;context&quot;. They can only be saved as part of save on the &quot;root&quot; object of the structure. </p>
