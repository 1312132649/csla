<P>I have been playing around with the Project Tracker sample. First I log on as "pm" and then open some Edit Project windows. Then I log off and log back on as "admin" and add a new Role object. I then log off again and log back on as "pm" and bring up one of the open project edit windows. The new Role object does not appear in the dropdowns; however, if I open a new Edit Project window, I can see the new Role in the dropdowns. </P>
<P>Also -- minor quibble -- I have to click on the dropdowns twice to get them to actually drop down.</P>
<P>Cheers,</P>
