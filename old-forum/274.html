<P>Andy, that's weblog I was looking for - no wonder I couldn't find it - the title doesn't help.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also will not forget the trick now.&nbsp; <STRONG>Right-click the Zip, choose Properties, click UnBlock, click Apply - and then unzip</STRONG>.</P>

<P>When I first downloaded the zip I unzipped into a folder under "Program Files". I got that untrusted message. Then I unzipped to c:\clsa, ran from there, and there was no untrusted message.</P>
