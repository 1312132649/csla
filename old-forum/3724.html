<P>The programming staff at my current client has been tasked with inheriting and extending existing web applications the were developed by a very CSLA focused team that has now moved on to other projects. In addition, all new applications (where CSLA is relevant) need to use the CSLA framework.</P>
<P>I'm pretty much their resident CSLA expert but I'll be leaving in about six weeks for a new and better life in San Francisco (woop!). As a result, I've been asked to give a presentation (or series of presentations) to try to whip them into shape when it comes to CSLA.</P>
<P>If anyone has a powerpoint presentation or other resource (they own the books) they could share that covers the what, whys, and hows of CSLA from a beginner to intermediate perspective I would *greatly* appreciate having a copy to help me structure my efforts.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance for any help you can provide,</P>
<P>Will</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Tuesday, October 16, 2007</h2><P>Someone started one of these about three years ago and I looked for it here and only found a version with three slides in it.&nbsp; I wish the old forum was searchable again; I might be able to find the thread it came from and refer you to the author.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But if three slides is better than nothing, I'll just attach the file I've got to this msg.&nbsp; I couldn't attach it as a .ppt file, so I zipped it (even though it's already tiny).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Wednesday, October 17, 2007</h2><P>I'm sure I'm stating the obvious but Rocky's "Using CSLA... " Handbooks are excellent for understanding...well...how to use CSLA.&nbsp; And they are cheap as chips.</P>
<P>Your company could of course get Rocky or Magenic in to give a presentation.</P>
<P>I'm sure they'll pick it up - there's nothing like learning by doing.</P>
<P>Enjoy your new job.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DesNolan replied on Wednesday, October 17, 2007</h2>Hi,<br>
