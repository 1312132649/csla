<p>The goal in my dept has been to do all rules/validation in CSLA objects going forward.&nbsp; However, for a current large project kicking off, the idea has also floated about placing some business rules in SSIS packages.&nbsp; One of the arguments for this (by the DBAs) is that they can easily see where things go wrong.</p>
<p>Rhe discussion has also included the possibility of a hybrid approach -- placing rules in CSLA objects but utilizing those objects from within SSIS packages (either directly or by exposing those objects via services).</p>
<p>Any thoughts on the matter and things to consider?&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>dlambert replied on Friday, January 11, 2013</h2><p>I&#39;ve recently had the pleasure of working with some SSIS packages, and I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve been too impressed with the development and debugging experience.&nbsp; I think my advice here would be to give some serious thought to what it&#39;s going to be like to support a solution like this, including (very important) *who* is going to be doing that support work.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve got DBA&#39;s who are interested in *owning* that part of the system, then I think it&#39;s only fair that their input be given a fair bit of weight, and if SSIS makes them more comfortable supporting that part of the system, then so be it.</p>
<p>For better or worse, though, my spidey-sense tells me that the DBA&#39;s want to be &quot;involved&quot;, but they might not really believe that they&#39;re offering to be part of the front-line support team.&nbsp; I believe if you can clear up who&#39;s &quot;involved&quot; vs. who&#39;s &quot;responsible&quot;, you might have a better basis to weight input like that.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, January 13, 2013</h2><p>This would also most likely prevent an n-level deployment of your application. Or would you rather create a command object in order to execute each rule?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think WinRT and WindowsPhone that has no direct database access to SQL Server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your clients would most likely require direct database access in order to execute the rules.&nbsp;</p>
