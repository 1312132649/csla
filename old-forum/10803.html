<p>In order to be able to use CollectionViewSource together with the PropertyStatus control &nbsp;in my WPF project as it is shown in the samples, I&nbsp;wanted to backport the PropertyStatus implementation into my version of 3.8.4. So far it compiles, but the error image does not show up when a rule is broken...</p>
<p>It seems that the new PropertStatus control reponds to changes in the BrokenRules collection in a different way as it did in version 3.8.x, </p>
<p>So before diving too deep into the csla 4.x code base, I better ask, what else needs to be changed&nbsp; to make the new PropertyStatus control work with the &quot;old&quot; validation subsystem, so that I can&nbsp;use&nbsp;CollectionViewSource?</p>
<p>Or maybe this is a dead end road...?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, October 25, 2011</h2><p>PropertyStatus is in 3.8.4 already, doesn&#39;t that meet your needs?</p>
<p>In any case, there were some differences (quirky stuff) around style state names that broke code from .NET 3.5 to 4. So when you bring PropertyStatus from CSLA 4 to 3.8, you&#39;d also need to bring the style from generic.xaml too.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>stefan replied on Friday, October 28, 2011</h2><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>But I already had changed that style with no luck. There must have been some stupid oversight from my side.</p>
<p>I finally went back to the 3.8 implementation with just one little change: In PropertyStatus.cs, I&nbsp;replaced the method &#39;GetRealSource&#39; with the version from CLSA 4. This version tests for ICollectionView.</p>
<p>So far it seems to do the trick, and I can use CollectionViewSource in the resource dictionaries...</p>
<p>No need to use Bxf.ModelManager any more!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
