Then you can compare with what is being used client side and throw an exception/display message etc. <br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, September 16, 2009</h2>I think by default if you don't do anything, an exception will be thrown if the versions don't match.  Are you finding this not to be true?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Wednesday, September 16, 2009</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>ajj3085:</strong></div><div>I think by default if you don't do anything, an exception will be thrown if the versions don't match.

<P>I have found this definitely to *not* be the case (at least when not using strong names -- I don't know if that matters)</P>
<P>If you make a data_portal call for&nbsp;something that doesn't exist on the server (e.g. it can't be deserialized), then you'll get an exception. But, until you hit a mismatched object server side, all will appear normal. </P>
<P>(I even have the impression that missing fields in two different versions of the same class&nbsp;just end up as null or default value on the "other" side, but I haven't explicitly&nbsp;verified this yet)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, September 16, 2009</h2>Ahh... that might be the case.  I always srrong name my assemblies, and I know I do get an exception if the versions don't match.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
