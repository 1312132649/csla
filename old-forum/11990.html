When my model &#39;s graph gets too bloated, the &quot;clone&quot; and &quot;undo&quot; routines are taking a long time and the window gets stuck due to the synchronous process, if the user try to click on screen, the browser crashes. Consider putting the &quot;clone&quot; and &quot;undo&quot; routines in a task.</span>

Im not an expirienced sulverlight user, but I do know IE has its quirks!</p>
<p>Sometimes IE10 even handles things even more worse than IE9!</p>
<p>Worth a shot?!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Dakianth replied on Monday, June 03, 2013</h2><p><span>The problem isn&#39;t browser, when you run a process in the same thread of the browser, if the process take time , the Tthread goes wait for the process conclusion, including the browser. The best solution is to run lengthy processes into separated threads</span>

<p>I assume this is due to having a very large object graph? </p>
<p>Have you considered the Diffgram approach as shown in the Samples\NET\cs\Csla.DiffGram sample?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also seen quite a performance improvement on using private backing field and [NotUndoable] attriute for fields that are not editable by user and/or [NonSerialized] for properties that are not required in the cloned object for save.</p>
