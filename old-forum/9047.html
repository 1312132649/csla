But if anyone happens to read this, just to verify I&#39;m on the right track: the authorization is handled by the underlying ReadOnlyBase objects that the list is a collection of, correct?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 08, 2010</h2><p>The only authz rules that apply to lists are per-type rules. Those are added in a static AddObjectAuthorizationRules() method, just like they were in 3.8.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Geoff_Manning replied on Tuesday, June 08, 2010</h2><p>Thank you so much, Rocky. I started using CSLA years ago and just started getting back into using it in a new project and am really rusty.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
