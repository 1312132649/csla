<p class=MsoNormal><span>The RegEx rule method allows you to provide the regular

<p class=MsoNormal>Just a thought...<br>
<br>
Could the regular expressions be split out of the framework and into a separate
library contrib project?&nbsp; That would at least mean all the hard work you'd
put into them wouldn't be lost and would avoid everyone coding the same
regex's.&nbsp; <br>

(please, nobody do that!)<br><br>Sorry, all I meant was why not pull the 3 regexs out of the framework and stick them in a separate file that people can use as a basis for their regex's, that way anyone who wants to change them can do so (and most importantly that 'anyone' is not you!)<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RobKraft replied on Friday, June 19, 2009</h2>I agree with Tom_W, let the community do it.  We already have other Regex of our own that we've added and using our own email Regex instead of the CSLA Regex is easy.
I just wanted to make sure you were aware of the upcoming domain changes in case you felt maintaining that Regex was important.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, June 20, 2009</h2>

Not to say some people might not have interest in maintaining a RegEx list here - but maybe that need is already being served. <br /><br />Also, if I remember right, Rocky's regular expression on E-mail doesn't allow an empty string to pass - so I bet most people aren't even using that one... anyways, it would be a pretty easy breaking change to adjust to I would imagine. <br /><br />Chris<br /><br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
