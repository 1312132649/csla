<P>1) Point out the oversight in providing contact information.</P>
<P>2) Request that the situation with&nbsp;my original account (kbaltrinic) be looked into.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>If necessary please correspond with me about this issue on the e-mail address associated with the kbaltrinic account.</P>
<P>Thank You!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>admin replied on Monday, June 12, 2006</h2><P>Good observation, thank you. I don't see any way within the forum software to automatically display any admin contact information. It is in the site setup, but apparently doesn't display anywhere.</P>
<P>So I added a line by the copyright notice with an email address for support&nbsp;- so at least it is visible somewhere...</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
