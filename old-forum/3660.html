These are a set of common behaviors and a broad purpose for an object.</P>
<P>NVLB supports a specific stereotype, which is intended to make it easy to populate read-only list/combobox controls.</P>
<P>BusinessListBase/BusinessBase support editable object scenarios. You want the editable root list stereotype, because that supports editing of lists and/or the objects contained in the lists.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>griff replied on Tuesday, October 09, 2007</h2>Thanks, will look into, Richard</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
