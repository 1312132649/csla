<P><FONT face=Arial>Using&nbsp;a base class would solve the problem, but I wanted to see how I can declare and inherit from an interface while using clsa?</FONT></P>

<p>A response to a quite old question, however this was the only post I could find.</p>
<p>Inheriting from the core interface was not really the issue, however it results in some methods that might not want to be exposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>DeleteChild;</li>
<li>SetParent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts on what is the best way to handle this?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Other than to look for maybe another interface higher in the hierarchy then no. </p>
<p>You _can_ implement the methods explicitly so that they are only available when you use the interface (cast) but once it is defined in the interface the methods/properties have to be implemented and available. &nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
