<P>My situation is that I have created a must inherit class [BaseFile] that is defined as having four Generic Types:</P><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>
<P>Public</FONT><FONT size=2> </FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>MustInherit</FONT><FONT size=2> </FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>Class</FONT><FONT size=2> BaseFile(</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>Of</FONT><FONT size=2> t_eFields, t_FieldDef </FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>As</FONT><FONT size=2> BaseFieldDefinitions.BaseFieldDefinition, t_FieldDefs </FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>As</FONT><FONT size=2> BaseFieldDefinitions, t_Record </FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>As</FONT><FONT size=2> BaseRecord)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>BaseFieldDefinitions and BaseRecord are nested classes in BaseFile, and BaseFieldDefinition is a nested class inside of BaseFieldDefinitions (all of this is so that the entire object hierarchy can "know" about the generic type paramaters in order to construct&nbsp;themselves properly).</FONT></P>
<P>The problem I am having is now I can not use databinding from within the same assembly where these classes&nbsp;are defined.&nbsp; Basicaly, I have a&nbsp;form that exists inside of the same assembly where these classes lives.&nbsp; I want to be able to bind a list box on this form to an object of T as IFieldDefinitions.&nbsp; When I attempt to add a data source I get this error right before the list of namespaces is populated:</P>
<P>The given assembly name or codebase was invalid. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131047)</P>
<P>In addition, it appears that I can not use the BaseFile class or its nested class as a Databinding source from any assembly (I don't get the error, but they won't appear in the list of selectable classes to create a Data Source for.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>After doing some research it appears that VS2005 has issues with databinding when a class is define with more then two generic types.&nbsp; My question is, has anyone else run up against this problem...and if so, any ideas for a solution?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
