<P>&nbsp; Here are a couple of examples of methods that were identified....</P>
<UL>
<LI class=MsoNormal>Placing <STRONG><SPAN>Insert(<SPAN>SqlCommand</SPAN> cm)</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN> methods in the&nbsp;superclass and a base.Insert(cm) in the subclass</SPAN> 
<LI class=MsoNormal><SPAN>Calling <STRONG>return base.Save()</STRONG> from the subclass' Save() method</SPAN></LI></UL>
<P><SPAN>I must have only printed out the source of the information and now I can't locate it.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>I believe I found it in the "old" discussion list, but again it may have been a blog post or article that Rocky did.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Thanks in advance --- I did see some newer posts on the subject, but this reference is critical to a presentation I am planning to make.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>If this approach has been "deprecated" or there is clearly a better way to implement inheritance ... please advise.</SPAN></P>
