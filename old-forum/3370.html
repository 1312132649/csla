<P>In the process of trying to figure out the correct syntax, my code threw an exception.</P>
<P>I changed the code in the method and started the application again from Visual Studio.</P>
<P>Here's the scary part: the "new" AddBusinessRules method did not fire,&nbsp;it apparently used the partial list of rules considered the last run to have set up the rules.</P>
<P>That means that my application is running with only some of the rules loaded.&nbsp; That's bad!</P>
<P>I'm not sure - at this time - whether this is a visual studio-only problem or whether it could happen in production.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, August 13, 2007</h2><P>Recall that Rocky only adds the rules once per type. And he does this the first time the type is referenced in the app domain.</P>
<P>Just because you re-start VS does not mean the app domain has been torn down. I always re-start IIS too when I want to be sure I have a "clean start".</P>
