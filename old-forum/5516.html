<P>The model I am considering is to create a set of distinct services that can be added or removed from a product.&nbsp; Each of these will be a "project" of its own so that they are completely modular.&nbsp; In several cases, there will be UI utilities developed for the service that provide the same access to the service behavior.&nbsp; A good example is a unified security service that provides user management features for a consuming application.&nbsp; This will allow multiple applications installed on the client's system to share security settings and information.&nbsp; We will have a small client application&nbsp;that allows users to perform tasks such as adding or modifying users, etc.</P>
<P>I have researched a number of different approaches looking at various design patterns and some real-world applications such as MS-Project and CRM to see how their architecture is implemented.&nbsp; My initial thought is to create the services as WCF and/or Web services that are consumed by the applications.&nbsp; Any utility application would also communicate through the service interface.&nbsp; However, I have two questions/issues that are making me hesitate:</P>
<P>1. Is this the right approach versus a direct reference to the dll in each application?&nbsp; In other words, rather than installing the service, provide each product team with a copy of the dll and have them add references directly to the assembly in their projects.&nbsp; This is how the ProjectTracker sample app is implemented but not how I see Microsoft doing it with their server applications.</P>
<P>What are the advantages of having the service interface (WCF/Web) between the application and the common component?&nbsp; This IS how Microsoft does it in Project Server 2007, for instance,&nbsp;where the Web Access application communicates through the PSI rather than directly referencing the server dlls.&nbsp; Using this model, the WPF Project Tracker application would be redesigned to use the WCF service interface rather than referencing the ProjectTracker.Library directly.</P>
<P>2. Deployment when there are multiple services.&nbsp; As I mentioned, we are looking at a lot of common logic that could result in many of these common components, each with a distinct purpose.&nbsp; Any or all of these components could be consumed as part of a product.&nbsp; I would need an easy way to package and&nbsp;distribute&nbsp;then deploy each of these services on a customer's system.&nbsp; I am having a hard time envisioning how this would work without a bunch of individual installers and a list of URL's (one for each service), etc.&nbsp; I like the idea of a PSI that contains each of the services installed on that system -&nbsp;one base URL for all of them.&nbsp; But, with an ala carte architecture...&nbsp; I dunno.</P>
<P>Does anyone have any experience in this area?&nbsp; What are your thoughts?</P>
