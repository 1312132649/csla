<P>Anyhow I thought there were two real options and I'm leaning to the first which seems the most simple:</P>
<P>1) Every x minutes I execute background commandBO and pass a copy of my BO and all associated BOLists.&nbsp; The command object does a simple database insert/update over the previous autoSave data and returns success / fail.&nbsp; </P>
<P>or</P>
<P>2) Every x minutes I set a 'IsAutoSaveFlag' call an async&nbsp;Save , reset the 'IsAutoSaveFlag' and let the dataportal handle things but I ignore whatever comes back.</P>
<P>The second option seems like lots of extra overhead etc but I'm wondering if anybody else implementing such a feature can recommend a reason why this may be a better choice.</P>
<P>Any other gotcha's out there?&nbsp; I suppose I need to deal with what happens if the autosave takes too long or doesn't come back etc.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
