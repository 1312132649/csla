<p style="padding-left:30px;"><a href="http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/FT06">http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/FT06</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Orchard: a new open source platform in Microsoft ASP.NET that you can use to build applications.</p>
<p>My CSLA experience is with standard&nbsp;WIN and WebForm apps, so&nbsp;I know I&#39;ve got a lot of catching up to do with threads, blog posts, and articles&nbsp;here&nbsp;about CSLA integration with MVC .</p>
<p>But I&#39;m posting here for advice from anyone else who has evaluated Orchard ... or can give me some insight on what I find to be a big incompatiblity between MVC&#39;s stateless foundation and CSLA.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also going to be taking a look at Graffiti CMS ... Telligent ... the company that developed Community Server contributed the open source version .... </p>
<p>I&#39;m assuming that it will be more suitable for a CSLA BO layer if it&nbsp;is WebForm based.</p>
<p>Any other platforms I might want to&nbsp;look at ??</p>
<p>Of course embedding Silverlight in either of these is a very interesting possiblity.</p>
<p>Thx,</p>
<p>Steve</p>
