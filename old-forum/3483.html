<P>Just wondering how well it performs on devices which are limited in terms of memory and bandwidth.&nbsp; I'm about to do some work in this area so will prototype and do some testing but would be interested to hear anyone's experiences, issues you came across, etc.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, September 05, 2007</h2>Search the forum, but I think Csla won't run on that.&nbsp; Rocky has expressed interest in make a "Csla Lite" that could run in Silverlight though.&nbsp; I'm not 100% sure I remember correctly though..<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Thursday, September 06, 2007</h2><P>Thanks.&nbsp; Why do I always forget the search facility?</P>
<P>It looks like you can if you cut out the Dataportal, serialzation and n-level undo.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Friday, September 07, 2007</h2>Without those features, wouldn't your business class just be a dataset again?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, September 07, 2007</h2>No, it means you don't have undo, and you can't use a remote application server, but those aren't the only benefits to Csla.<br><br>You still have validation and authorization support, proper business object design, rule checking, etc.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
