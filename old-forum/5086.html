It supports both CSLA 3.0.4 and 3.5 and follows cery closely Rocky's patterns.</P>

I'm still not sure when to use some of them... right now I just ignore them all.<br><br>Thanks!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Friday, July 18, 2008</h2><P>I do not use partial classes.</P>
<P>But as I recall, the extra event hooks are needed because you cannot Override a method in a Partial class. So if you want to "change the behavior" of the method that was code generated you have to use the hook in the partial class.</P>
