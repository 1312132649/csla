<ol>
<li>Support for iOS </li>
<li>Support for WinRT on Windows Phone 8.1 </li>
<li>Support for Universal Apps that target WinRT on Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 </li>
<li>A new HttpProxy/Host data portal channel that doesn&#39;t rely on WCF </li>
<li>A new BrokeredProxy/Host data portal channel that allows a WinRT (Win8) app to call a local data portal running in full .NET</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/issues?milestone=8&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">version 4.5.600 change log</a>. </p>
<p>You can download the msi installer from the <a href="https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/releases/tag/v4.5.600">release page</a>, or better yet add references to the framework <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=csla">via NuGet</a>. </p>
<p>Version 4.5.600 includes support for iOS (via Xamarin) and for WinRT on Windows Phone 8.1 in the WinRT.Phone project. This also means you can use the new Universal solution/project type to build WinRT apps for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. </p>
<p>This prerelease also includes the new HttpProxy/Host and BrokeredProxy/Host data portal channels. </p>
<p>The Http data portal channel allows you to host the data portal server directly in ASP.NET MVC 4 or MVC 5 without the need for WCF. It relies only on the HttpClient library to invoke the server, so the client has no dependency on WCF - important for the new Windows Phone 8.1 programming model where WCF doesn&#39;t exist. </p>
<p>The Brokered data portal channel allows you to host the data portal server in .NET as a brokered assembly, thus available to a WinRT client app. This means you can build a WinRT app that makes data portal calls, where the &quot;server-side&quot; code is also running on the client device, but has access to full .NET. This will only work on Intel-based devices where full .NET assemblies can be deployed. It will only work with side-loaded apps, not apps from the Windows Store.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
