Deep inside the code this is triggered by WCF, or in a 1- or 2-tier deployment it is triggered by the BackgroundWorker used to make the call async.</p>
<p>In a Silverlight app using local mode the data portal uses a BackgroundWorker to make the DataPortal_XYZ method run on a background thread. When the DataPortal_XYZ method completes, the BackgroundWorker tells the data portal it is complete, and that triggers the async callback.</p>
