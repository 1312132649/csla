<p>This installation package could not be opened. Contact the application vende to erify that this is a valid windows installer package. </p>
<p>I have downloaded it multiple times with different browser to see if something is wrong in the download, and I tried 4.5.10, which installed correctly. Any ideas what can be wrong. Is it possible to get a zip of 4.5.30?</p>

<p>But you can always get the source as a zip from GitHub. For example, you can click the &#39;get a zip&#39; button on the 4.5.30 tag page:</p>

<p>I tried downloading the installer on my dev computer and the installer starts up just fine so I doubt it is a problem with the installer package.&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
