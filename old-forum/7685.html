<P>Unfortunately the VS10 upgrade wizard can't handle some of the contents of the csla.csproj file. I don't know why this is, because that file was created by Visual Studio originally. Of course it has been around since 2003, so maybe some version of Visual Studio between 2003 and 2008 added some stuff that the 2010 upgrade wizard doesn't understand (which seems like a bug to me).</P>
<P>In any case, there's some effort involved in getting the project to open in VS10, which is covered in the blog post Jonny referenced.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
