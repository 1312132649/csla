<P>I specifically chose to leave it as create/fetch/update/delete for all objects, since 'execute' is just a renamed update. Adding the 'execute' call means doing another type check on all data portal operations to see if the object inherits from CommandBase and I was doing a (certainly minor) performance optimization to avoid the cast.</P>
<P>Ultimately it is important to remember that my goal with object factory is to support a future version of EF where you (hopefully) wouldn't write each factory object by hand, but rather it would delegate into some code that is at least partially generated by EF.</P>
<P>But if it is really too confusing it might be worth making the change, even if my ultimate EF implementation needs to somehow bypass it or something.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
