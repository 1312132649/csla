If you store a field reference to another object that is an implicit containment or aggregation relationship, and in CSLA tems that expresses a parent-child relationship.</P>
<P>If you explicitly don't want such a relationship then you should use a private backing field, with that field marked as NotUndoable and probably NonSerialized.</P>
<P>You can still use a PropertyInfo&lt;T&gt; and GetProperty() to implement the property, but not a managed backing field.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
