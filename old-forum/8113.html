<P>Anyone have a good Windows Communication Foundation book to recommend?</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>Some other folks I work with use the book by Michele Bustamante, and they like it.&nbsp; From what I'm told, it's more of&nbsp;a "beginner" book that&nbsp;lays out things in a more step-by-step fashion.&nbsp; That's not to say it's not useful - just not as deep as Juval's book.</FONT></P>

<P>So, between those two and the silverlight 3 book, I'll have lots of reading to do..</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>k2so replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2>I used the O'Reilly book.<br>I think it covers basically everything essential.<br><br>I also used the the MS book to study for the MCTS and it's not bad, but lacks a bit of details. It's good to start with this, but don't think it's good for reference.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2>I think the Juval book is oriely as well.. so I think they'll complement each other.&nbsp; Its good to hear that both will&nbsp;be good, and it sounds like the&nbsp;Juval one will pick up where the other leaves off.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2><P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>Yes, both books are O'Reilly books.&nbsp; And I didn't mean to suggest that Juval's book isn't complete - it certainly is.&nbsp; But his book is more of a reference-style book.&nbsp; You can certainly read it front-to-back, but I don't think that's the best way to do it.&nbsp; The first few chapters cover all the basics, and provide some very valuable best-practice information, so they are well worth a front-to-back read.&nbsp; But once you get past that, there's an awful lot more that you probably won't need to solve your problem.&nbsp; But the book sections are labeled well enough that&nbsp;you should be able to pick the parts you want to use and read those.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>IMO, the biggest problem with Juval's book is that while he covers all the configuration options, there really isn't a section that says "if you're building HTTP-based services, this is the basic configuration; if you're building TCP-based services, this is the basic configuration", etc.&nbsp; This is supposedly the piece in Michele's book that is the most useful over Juval's book (I haven't seen Michele's book, so I can't directly comment.)&nbsp; Since&nbsp;Juval covers pretty much all&nbsp;of WCF, the relevant configuration information tends to be spread throughout the book.&nbsp; But I found that taking the "topic-based" approach with his book helped.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>Those at my company who recommend Michele's book are people I trust, and I'm not trying to say one book is better than the other - just offering my experience in working with Juval's book.&nbsp; I'm betting that both books are good.&nbsp; I have had pretty good luck with O'Reilly books anyway.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>What I have found in working with WCF is that while the basic concepts are relatively simple (if you've ever done any kind of service programming), it's the configuration that kills you.&nbsp; You don't find out whether you have a configuration&nbsp;error until run-time, and the exception messages are often less-than-helpful.&nbsp; Once you figure out the configuration,&nbsp;it makes sense&nbsp;- but getting there can be a real pain.&nbsp; At my company, we found that when we first started programming WCF services, we spent upwards of 80% of&nbsp;our development/testing time getting the configuration right.&nbsp; We now have configuration templates that we use, so developers down the road don't spin their wheels.&nbsp; But that 80% was pretty painful, and - at least in VS 2008 - the IDE offers almost no help.</FONT></P>

<P>It sounds like having both books would be a good way for me to go, so I ordered them both.</P>
<P>I think one of the reviews for Juval's book likened it to Rocky's BO books, as far as the depth of knowledge goes, so that was a positive in my eyes.</P>
<P>I look forward to configuring wcf <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></P>
<P>Thanks for the feedback!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Thursday, December 10, 2009</h2>There is a 15 part msdn webcast series for wcf by Michele Leroux Bustamante<br /><br />This covers all basics and some advanced stuff also.. below is the link of first part, u can find others on msdn site..<br /><br />http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032344313&amp;EventCategory=5&amp;culture=en-US&amp;CountryCode=US<br /><br />After covering this u can get Juval's book for advanced stuff..</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
