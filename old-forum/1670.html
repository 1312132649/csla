This is because my application integrates with a third party application via an API.&nbsp;Most of my DP methods have API calls, and some have both API calls and SQL. The&nbsp;API calls are to the third party application (which must be executing on the same workstation as my application in order for the API calls to function). I'm wondering if there are things I can do (such as not use the serializable attribute, or use the RunLocal attribute for all dp methods, etc...) to maximize CSLA performance since this particular *logical* business layer will absolutely never be on a different *physical* tier than the UI and will always be "local". Or, should I not even worry about it?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bayu replied on Thursday, November 02, 2006</h2>Don't worry about it. <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br><br>Bayu<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Thursday, November 02, 2006</h2><P>Same here.&nbsp; When you're using the 'SimpleDataPortal' everything runs local anyway.&nbsp; And if you look deep in the Csla code base you'll notice that when you app is configured as such it won't tax you with the overhead of serialization.&nbsp; The framework is _intelligent_ enough not to serialize when not necessary.</P>
