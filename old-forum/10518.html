<p>contains the stereotypes?&nbsp; If not, then i&#39;m looking for a fully implemented (all CRUD) sample of a parent business base with editable children.&nbsp; The samples rocky has are kind of all over the place and it makes it difficult to follow the e-books.</p>

<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Randar replied on Tuesday, July 12, 2011</h2><p>I&#39;m struggling with lack of samples for WinForm as well.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Project Tracker does not work right now.&nbsp; See this post for details <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/10476/49042.aspx#49042">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/10476/49042.aspx#49042</a>.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 12, 2011</h2><p>If you have the ebook series, follow the samples from the <em>Data Access</em> ebook. Those samples show every stereotype.</p>
<p>The only thing you need to do differently for Windows Forms is to have the collections subclass the &quot;BindingList&quot; base classes - like BusinessBindingListBase instead of BusinessListBase.</p>
<p>That should get you all the business class code you need for any type of app.</p>
<p>For Windows Forms UI example code, look at the 3.7 ProjectTracker sample. That should have a working Windows Forms UI. The exact same UI techniques used in that code (and described in the <em>Using CSLA .NET 3.0</em> ebook) still apply today. Windows Forms hasn&#39;t changed in any meaningful way since 2005.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
