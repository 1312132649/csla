<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I can't really say whether the WebGrid will make your day or not.&nbsp; For hierarchical display, it certainly is relatively easy to use.&nbsp; But it's also kinda heavy if&nbsp;all you're doing is read-only tree displays, and making the grid read-only introduces some annoying rendering side-effects.&nbsp; We do very little in-place editing in our grids.&nbsp; I've done it before on flat grids, and it is pretty slick, but I don't know whether the technique I used translates when the grid is hierarchical.&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;I didn't&nbsp;use the row template features either.&nbsp; Another programmer here did on one project, and he was fighting&nbsp;to get it working&nbsp;for quite a while.&nbsp; But that could have been his inexperience with the control.</FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If you are going to buy a new version, my advice to you is to go
with another manufacturer.&nbsp; I believe you mentioned Infragistics in one of your
earlier messages, and as far as I can tell those controls whether Windows or
Web have always been a nightmare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ya, I think I'm gonna ask to buy the newer version.&nbsp; I
won't be using the grid for readonly.. that would be overkill.&nbsp; But for
editing, I'm hoping it will save me a lot of effort.&nbsp; I'm also hoping it's
similar enough to the WinGrid control that I'll be able to pick it up pretty
quickly.&nbsp; <img id="_x0000_i1025" src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile <img src=" />"><br>

<P>FWIW, here is how I do it in my web app:</P>
<P>1. I have a Search screen where the user can input criteria (name, ID, address, etc.) and each row of criteria has a check box so I can tell if they filled it in or not. Then I send this crtieria BO to a ROC as the "Criteria" and ask it for the "filter" to use as part of the WHERE clause. It loops over the "checked" properties and builds the filter.</P>
<P>2. The ROC is then fetched and bound to a grid. The last column of the grid contains buttons like Edit or Delete.</P>
<P>3. When the user clicks Edit, the querystring includes the ID of the object in that row. The edit page opens, reads the querystring, and fetches the root BO based on the ID. No need to pass a full blown RO object to the edit page. The RO object on the ROC only has a small part of the total information anyway - just the ID and Name and Status (for example).</P>

I've actually been pretty happy with them.&nbsp; At any rate, I already have a pretty large WinForms application that uses their controls pretty extensively, and I'm not sure I'd want to go back now and have to retouch all those screens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this will be first time using the Asp.Net controls... which also seem good, it's just the designer that isn't working for them properly anymore.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
