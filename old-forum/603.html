Finally, the SP returns an error code (i.e. 0 or i) which another method in Products will interpret as "An error occurred" or "The Insert was successful". &nbsp;This string will then be sent to the webform.<BR>How do I add CSLA to this architecture?</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vargasbo replied on Wednesday, July 12, 2006</h2>Myers,<br><br>This is such a generic question, but if you download the example that Rocky has with his book you'll see how he's doing what you're looking for.<br><br>Regards,<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Wednesday, July 12, 2006</h2><P>Ditto!&nbsp; The ProjectTracker application you can download is a really well-crafted sample application.</P>
<P>Simple enough to get a handle on, but complex enough to see lots of common real-world situations being handled using the CSLA framework.&nbsp; </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Misled replied on Thursday, July 13, 2006</h2><P>In CSLA, you will not be "Adding" products, the business object will be doing that for you per your DataPortal_XXXX methods. If there is an error, it will be returned to your client code and you can act accordingly. If no error is returned, then "The Insert was successful".&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>This application framework is actually quite simple to use&nbsp;yet complicated enough to do anything you need to do. Read the book and implement it. You'll be impressed......</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
