One of the features will be the ability for have photos and associate them to different items on the site.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am planning on having one table for the photo, and many linking tables so I can relate the photo to different items (instead of having a column for each item in the photo table):<br /><br />Photo<br />Photo_X_Singer<br />Photo_X_News<br />Photo_X_Member</p>
<p>In the previous website, I would have created a class for each of the linking tables and call the CRUD methods of each class depending on what I was doing.&nbsp; However, recently, I&#39;ve seen two different examples that use &quot;navigation properties&quot; to handle this sort of scenario.<br /><br />Using navigation properties, the Photo class would have a list of Singers associated with this photo.&nbsp; So when I wanted to delete a specific row in the Photo_X_Singer table (which removes this singer from the photo and removes the photo from this singer&#39;s profile) I would need to load the photo class, then load the Singers property (could be done using lazy loading) and then call DeleteSelf() on the specific Singer.<br /><br />I can see how this approach would make sense on a smart client that would keep the objects in memory, however, since I&#39;m doing this on the web, I think it make more sense to call Delete(photoId, singerId) on the Photo_X_Singer class??</p>

<p>Why bother to fetch and load a BO just to delete a row in the DB that you already have the key values for?</p>
