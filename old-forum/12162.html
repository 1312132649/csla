<p>I imagine most of you using Silverlight are already thinking about exit strategy (as are we)&nbsp;but are also hoping that 2021 has some meaning (Microsoft support date).</p>
<p>Wanted to mention there is a post on Silverlight.net someone brought up about Chrome not supporting NPAPI (including Silverlight) at some point - one article citing the end of 2014.&nbsp; I also wanted to mention that there are a few articles out there about Windows 8.1 and IE11 and some issues with Silverlight - I haven&#39;t had an opportunity to vet that configuration yet.</p>
<p>Further, Firefox may require a &quot;click to activate&quot; plug-ins (i.e. Silverlight) starting in December of this year.</p>
<p>Just a heads up for anyone this information is useful to.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Peran replied on Tuesday, October 01, 2013</h2><p>Thanks for sharing.</p>

<p>Peran</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, October 01, 2013</h2><p>Ironically within a day this information was disseminated, another post was made in the Silverlight.net forum - talking about the potential rebirth of Silverlight in some form (total rumor - but I don&#39;t see any reason why the poster would be motivated to post falsehood in a credible sort of manner).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not getting my hopes up; however, it doesn&#39;t seem like an impossibility that something could happen.&nbsp; If you&#39;ve done the &quot;googling-for-future-of-Silverlight&quot; you&#39;ve probably stumbled upon the outdated roadmaps showing Silverlight 6 in 2014.&nbsp; You never know, sure would make my day.</p>
