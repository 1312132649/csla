This is due to some sort of security issue on the server. I don't know if it is Windows, or the forum software or what exactly, and we are trying to trace it down so we can fix it.</P>
<P>In the meantime, I'm manually checking the forum in the mornings and restarting IIS to get it running if it is down...</P>
<P>I appreciate your patience as we troubleshoot whatever is happening on the server.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
