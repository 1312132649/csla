I&#39;m following the instructions in Chapter 19 - Windows Presentation Foundation UI in the C# 2000 book, to setup my form. I have not been able to get too far with what is in the book. </p>
<p>Is there an update to this chapter in the new ebooks?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Hector</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hector replied on Thursday, February 24, 2011</h2><p>I got a little further with this form. This form is being used to add a new Store object. The store object has 2 string properties: StoreId and Name.</p>
<p>This form has 2 textboxes and 2 buttons. One button is for canceling and the other is for adding the new Store to the database.</p>
<p>I finally got the PropertyStatus controls hooked up to the new Store object. I&#39;m currently stuck with the Save button. I looked through the samples, but wasn&#39;t able to find anything that looks similar to what I&#39;m doing with this save button.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 24, 2011</h2><p>This is a multi-part answer.</p>
<p>First, when I wrote the 2008 book Micorosft still though the data provider model was a pretty cool idea. That time has passed, and essentially everyone is using some variation of MVVM or maybe MVP these days. The data provider support in CSLA 4 is a hold-over from that earlier time and will eventually be phased out.</p>
<p>Second, the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;CategoryID=4&amp;List=1&amp;SortField=DateCreated+DESC%2cProductName&amp;Level=1&amp;ProductID=21">CSLA 4 MVVM video series</a> is essentially the replacement/update for the WPF content from the 2008 book - covering how to build a WPF or Silverlight UI using MVVM with CSLA 4.</p>
<p>Third, the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series will include a book (planned as book 5) that covers WPF/Silverlight development using CSLA 4 and MVVM (I&#39;ll use <a href="http://bxf.codeplex.com">Bxf</a> as the MVVM framework).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>HectorSosaJr replied on Friday, February 25, 2011</h2><p>Thanks Rocky!</p>
<p>This gives me a pretty good idea as to where to look for these sort of questions.</p>
