<P>I use both Chart and Gauge controls from Infragistics.</P>
<P>For Chart Data I used a CSLA Read Only Collection to retrieve the data from the database. I probably could have bound it directly to the chart but I wanted extra flexibilty in the code to do other things so I created a helper method to extract the data from the ROC and build a DataTable and bound that.</P>
<P>The support team at Infragistics was extremely helpful. The Chart control is extremely powerful and I used all the features that I needed for my project (and I doubt I tapped 10% of the features of the control.)</P>
