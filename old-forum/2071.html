implementing both root and child collection classes (ListBase) I have
come across situations where we would seem to like to see the
implementation of Type/Instance Business rules - in much the same
manner as you would do in a root BusinessBase sub class.<br>
<br>
For example at the simplest level, a collection could have a rule that
it cant be an empty collection. The only way to enforce this for a
child collection is via the IsValid property of the parent. - No chance
if its a root collection.<br>
<br>
A root (or child) collection might need to have a few key properties
around the collection itself. Say when it represents a batch of items
to be posted with a common batch No or Date property.&nbsp; I agree
that you could have a parent business class(with BusinessRules)&nbsp;
to host the collection - but why? -&nbsp; when its just one or two
common properties that require validation.<br>

<P>I always add those kinds of rules to the Parent BO that contains the collection (because there is no where else to put them.)</P>
