I want to cascade this event into its parent business object such that the INotifyPropertyChanged gets called. I should mention i am implementing INotifyPropertyChanged&nbsp; in my Child Business Object.<br><br>I can hook up this event between business object and member fields however I am wondering if it will be lost over serialization? If so I would like to be able to extend the deserialization handler such that I can re-wire the member field objects of my business object to call the BO's INotifyPropertyChanged event.<br><br>Does that make sense or is a code example required? Essentially I am hooking up events in the child EditableRootListBase object internally and want to be sure they will stay hooked up.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Rob<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FireGarden replied on Wednesday, July 04, 2007</h2>Perhaps I am not thinking straight. <br><br>I believe I could just re-wire the events in an override of OnDeserialized() in my root business object?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, July 05, 2007</h2>That's the recommended pattern, yes.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
