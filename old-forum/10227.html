<p>Application we are trying to develop has multiple DB say 2 Databases. I am using CSLA frame work with single adohelper class in DAL and generating the BLL using CSLA templates. I am using dot net 4.0 framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is currently we are using WCF to connect to the other datbase and one db string is stored in my web.config of the application. In this such situation should I go for the 2 connection strings. My 2 databases reside on 2 different locations/servers.</p>

<p>Your data access code (in any of the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/DataFaq.ashx">four data access models</a>) will then open connections to both databases as necessary to get and update the data in your object model.</p>
<p>If you need transactional protection, you must use EnterpriseServices transactions, and that will use the DTC. If you have two databases, you must use distributed 2-phase transactions. That results in lower performance, and means you must configure the DTC, but you get transactional safety at the database level.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
