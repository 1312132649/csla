I just need a quick understanding of how i can add friends to a user. the structure that i have right now is a parent Object called User with a Child List object called Friends. I'm using that assign function in the childlist object but what i dont understand is what parameter should i be using to add a user as a friend. Should i be using the ApplicationContext session that was&nbsp;created in the MembershipProvider.ValidateUser method, or should I just be using the User.UserID? right now it's setup for the User.UserID. I just dont know if this is going to work the way it's supposed to work. I haven't gone through the debugger just yet. I'm just looking for some input&nbsp;on how&nbsp;someone would go with this</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 09, 2007</h2><P>You should think about your use cases.</P>
<P>Obviously you have several - at least these:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Add a user</LI>
<LI>Add a friend to a user</LI>
<LI>Get a list of users</LI>
<LI>Get a list of friends for a user</LI></UL>
<P>Each of these will have different objects to help implement the use case.</P>
<P>Your User object (editable root) may have a child collection of editable child UserFriend objects. Adding a friend to a user would be a matter of adding an item to that list and saving the User. Obviously there are other ways you can model this, but this model is pretty common.</P>
<P>If you are trying to save the data into the MembershipProvider&nbsp;I can't help - I haven't explored that part of ASP.NET to speak of. I think you are better off using the Profile (or UserProfile?) feature of ASP.NET 2.0, because that allows you to define your own data schema.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
