<p>Ended up with a short discussion about some projected changes to the DataPortal.&nbsp; While this question doesn&#39;t directly pertain to that, it did raise another question in my head.&nbsp; So rather than divert the original post even further, I figured I&#39;d start a new one.</p>
<p>What&#39;s the possibility of essentially segregating the DataPortal out&nbsp;into a standalone assembly&nbsp;in a future version of CSLA?&nbsp; It&#39;s been mentioned a couple of times that the DataPortal doesn&#39;t really have any dependency on CSLA objects - any serializable object can move through the DataPortal.</p>
<p>The reason I ask is that we&#39;re starting to get into SL development, and while I don&#39;t think I could convince folks to use the full CSLA, I very well could convince them to use the DataPortal as our transport mechanism between client and server.&nbsp; I think that would be a real boon to our development, and would save us a whole bunch of time that would essentially be spent &quot;re-inventing the wheel&quot;.&nbsp; So being able to grab that piece in its entirety easily would be beneficial.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure some folks would say that if I can convince them of using the DataPortal, moving to the full CSLA isn&#39;t that far behind.&nbsp; From my perspective, that&#39;s not necessarily the case.&nbsp; Using the DataPortal could be considered a &quot;black box&quot; that doesn&#39;t significantly impact the programming model, while moving full-force to CSLA objects is a much more... well, intrusive change.</p>
<p>(And yes, while I realize that anything we do build in-house&nbsp;is likely&nbsp;going to replicate&nbsp;a fair amount&nbsp;of the CSLA codebase, we already have some developers who do not share my views on the value of the CSLA structure for business objects.&nbsp; One fight at a time...)</p>

<p>But consider.</p>
<p>The data portal depends on code in Csla.Core, Csla.Serialization, Csla.Reflection and (I think) Csla.Threading.</p>
<p>So all those would need to move into this new project.</p>
<p>Of course other parts of Csla have dependencies on those namespaces/features as well.</p>
<p>But you can argue that none of them have anything to do with the data portal - it is just that the data portal depends on them.</p>
<p>So following this train of thought to its logical conclusion, someone might say &quot;I want to use the cool dynamic method features from Csla.Reflection, and I don&#39;t want to use the rest of CSLA&quot;.</p>
<p>To accommodate that, I&#39;d really need to move those things into a Csla.Core.dll, or maybe Csla.Core.dll, Csla.Serialization.dll, Csla.Reflection.dll, etc.</p>
<p>Then a normal CSLA user would need to (at a minimum) add references to maybe 4-6 assemblies.</p>
<p>If we took a vote on that, I&#39;m pretty sure we can predict the (overwhelming) outcome.</p>
<p>I still remember the rejoicing that occurred when CSLA 2.0 had just one assembly (as opposed to the five or so from 1.x)</p>
<p>My recommendation to you Scott, is to reference Csla.dll and only use the data portal. Just ignore the rest of what&#39;s in the assembly.</p>
<p>(though on Silverlight and WP7 you would need to make use of the various IMobileObject base types: MobileObject, MobileList, etc. to build serializable objects)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
