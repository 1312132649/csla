<P>Given that this announcement makes it sound like WF will become and official part of the .NET Framework sooner than later and no longer an "add-on" toy for some of us to try on for size, I am wondering what kind of support Csla offers for workflow-oriented applications that make use of the features and functionality provided by WF?&nbsp; Do we have to make changes to accomodate WF and how will using WF affect the way we make use of the Csla&nbsp;framework?</P>
<P>This can also be extended to Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) that are also supposed to&nbsp;become a part of .NET 3.0 as well as the new InfoCard stuff.</P>
<P>I'm hoping Rocky will jump in here and educate us all on what to expect.</P>
<P>thx</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 14, 2006</h2><P>I've discussed this before (but maybe on the old forum).</P>
<P>There are, I think, two primary ways CSLA and WF intersect.</P>
<OL>
<LI>You can use a CommandBase-derived object to encapsulate the concept of starting a workflow naturally within the context of your business object model. In other words, the workflow (probably on the server) is represented by an object in your model.</LI>
<LI>You can implement a workflow task using CSLA objects. If you think about a task, it is a clearly defined bit of functionality. What is a use case? A clearly defined bit of functionality. Thus, a task is a use case - so implementation of a WF task is a perfect place to be applying OOD and OOP.</LI></OL>
<P>Neither of these should require any changes to CSLA.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
