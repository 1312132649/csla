I am not looking to do anything fancy, just an overview highlighting the biggest strengths of the framework.<br /><br />We normally schedule about 1 hour for presentations like this and they normally occur during lunch time. In all, I suspect that I will have a total of about 50 minutes to give my presentation.<br /><br />What I would like to know is if someone has done something similar to what I am looking to do and if so, if I could borrow the material they used. Especially if they include some power point presentation slides.<br /><br />Any help is appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
