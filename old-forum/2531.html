<P>I'd like to know thoughts on adding another method to CSLA like ApplyAllEdits.&nbsp; It would basically just loop through calling ApplyEdit until the edit level is to zero.&nbsp; Does this sound like it would be useful to anyone else?&nbsp; Or should I just pay more attention and figure out where data binding will be calling BeginEdit for me? ;-)</P>
<P>Thanks for any thoughts!<BR></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, March 15, 2007</h2><P>You really need to call bindingSource.EndEdit() or CancelEdit(), otherwise data binding itself can get confused.</P>
<P>So even if there was an ApplyAllEdits() you could call on a root object, your end result wouldn't be reliable because data binding wouldn't know what you did.</P>
<P>In short, you just need to pay more attention I'm afraid... :)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
