<p>Modern components such as the DataGrids from vendors like Devexpress can consume data exposed via technologies WCF Data Services, Entity Framework, LINQ to SQL etc. providing a very impressive end user experience. Only the data which is required by the UI at any moment is requested and sent down the pipe to the client.</p>
<p>Now while it is natural to use ORM technologies in the DataPortal_XYZ methods for individual Csla business objects, I&#39;m having trouble trying to figure out how Csla lists can fit in with this latest generation of UI controls. I could bypass Csla entirely for queries, but it would be much better if I could keep any data access technology away from the client entirely.</p>

<p>However this is a little more complex, in that the UI components I would like to use consume data exposed by technologies which implement Open Data Protocol (OData). This is where I wondering if anyone had any experience marrying up Csla business objects with data services like these.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
