<P>I have&nbsp;one FormView and two GridViews on a Wizard Step for entry of Person info, addresses and Phones Respectively.&nbsp; All use CslaDataSources. Address and Phone GridViews have EditTemplates to edit and Update each row - and it does not appear odd.&nbsp;</P>
<P>For the Person Info in the FormView, however, I would rather not add an Update CommandButton.&nbsp; It seems neater to trigger a FormView&nbsp;Update event when the user clicks the Next button in the Wizard.</P>
<P>I can't seem to find a way to do that.&nbsp; Would appreciate a hint or two. Thanks</P>
