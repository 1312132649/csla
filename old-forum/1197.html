<P>I copied the same method I am currently using and return a normal dataset.&nbsp; He binds the Janus grid to the dataset, and it shows 151 records.&nbsp; I am currently downloading the demo of the Janus grid, but I have never used it.&nbsp; Before I get too deep in working with this grid, does anything in this scenario stand out that I might be missing?&nbsp; Thanks in advance!<BR></P>
