<br><br> I'm starting with CSLA and I am interested in its relationship

<br><br> These already clarified part of my doubt about how use more objects LINQ that SPROCs. 
<br><br>But, Yet there remains concern about opinion<br><br> Which is best? SPROCs or objects using LINQ? 
<br><br> What reasons behind their choice? advantages and disadvantages,
performance, object oriented, maintainability, consistent with CSLA? <br><br> Especially, I want a response from Rocky, or someone who knows
their plans, about which of the two methods fits more with the future
of CSLA and ADO.Net Entity Framework. <br><br> Again, I appreciate the help they can provide.</font></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
