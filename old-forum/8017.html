<P>For my part I'll certainly change CSLA to support IDataErrorInfo, but I don't even use that in WPF because PropertyStatus is so much more powerful. CSLA already supports DataAnnotations so that's done - but again, the DataForm isn't as powerful as using PropertyStatus because it can only handle error severity rules, and only validation attributes.</P>
<P>CSLA does so much more than either of the Microsoft models, that I find them lacking. I surely support both, but use neither...</P>
<P>The biggest (to me) feature of SL4 is that an SL4 class library can run in .NET 4. This means you should be able to create one business assembly (SL4 class library) that runs on the client and app server. No more linking files between two projects and all that work - nice!!!</P>
<P>The one catch to that, is that the business layer becomes truly one project, that can only contain SL code. So the DataPortal_XYZ model may not work at all in this case. ObjectFactory will work fine, and DataPortal_XYZ <EM>might work</EM> if you are using an external DAL via a repository pattern or something similar.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Friday, November 20, 2009</h2>The printing support, right-click support, and being able to run the desktop are all very compelling for desktop applications.
