Rocky</h4>
<p>I am reading your book Expert C# Objects 2008.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Distributed Architecture</p>
<p>Page : 28</p>
<h4>Just Above Paragrapg Heading : A New Logical Architecture</h4>
<p>You Mentioned: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>As long as there is support for mobile objects,</em></strong></span> this is an ideal solution: it provides code reuse, low maintenance costs, and high performance.</p>
<p>What do you mean by:&nbsp; that underline sentence ?</p>
<p>waiting for an early response.</p>
<p>regards</p>

That requires the ability to serialize an object graph at the field level, regardless of the scope of those fields.</p>
<p>Java and .NET do provide that capability. COM did not, which made this architecture much harder. </p>
<p>However, since writing that book, I&#39;ve made Silverlight support mobile objects, even though it doesn&#39;t have native support for the concept. That&#39;s the reason for the MobileFormatter - which is how I added mobile object support to a platform that otherwise doesn&#39;t support the idea (due to limitations on reflection).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
