It basically means that WCF, on the server, couldn&#39;t find something - probably whatever assembly contains your host/portal class (and that&#39;s probably Csla.dll unless you are using a custom compressed proxy or something).</p>
<p>But it might be finding Csla.dll and not finding the type inside the assembly.</p>
<p>So odds are that either Csla.dll isn&#39;t in the bin directory, or that you have a config issue. The config issue is the most likely problem. Compare your web.config system.serviceModel section to a known-to-be-working server web.config and see what&#39;s different.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Thursday, July 22, 2010</h2><p>Rocky,</p>
<p>I am a&nbsp;little confused about the contract value in the endpoint in ClientConfig file. for example, the following is from SimpleApp:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;client&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;endpoint address=&quot;<a href="http://localhost:1993/WcfPortal.svc">http://localhost:1993/WcfPortal.svc</a>&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; binding=&quot;basicHttpBinding&quot; bindingConfiguration=&quot;BasicHttpBinding_IWcfPortal&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contract=&quot;WcfPortal.IWcfPortal&quot; name=&quot;BasicHttpBinding_IWcfPortal&quot; /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/client&gt;<br />This was also&nbsp;the gist of suggestion made by the user from Netherlands (I am sorry, I cannot recall his name).&nbsp; The reason I ask is that that is what I had in my Csla4.0 project, and now I am wondering if that may be the problem.&nbsp; The reason I said &#39;had&#39;, instead of &#39;have&#39;, is because I set aside the 4.0 project this morning and went back to the last 3.8.4 version.&nbsp; I am now making a second attempt, this time trying to be more methodical and cotinuously testing after change.</p>
<p>I have now come to the point where I have the 3.8.4 project working in .Net 4 and SL 4.&nbsp; But the interesting thing is that my endpoint is:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contract=&quot;<strong>Csla.</strong>WcfPortal.IWcfPortal&quot; name=&quot;BasicHttpBinding_IWcfPortal&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>and everything is working just fine.&nbsp; I thought? the whole point of that modification was to run 3.8.4 projects with SL 4.&nbsp; In any case this time, I have already made all DataPortal.Deletes generic, they were the only non generics.&nbsp; All PropertyInfo&#39;s are public.&nbsp; All Criteria classes are BusinessBase, and all validation stuff is simply commented out.&nbsp; Hopefully this time the sudden explosion of errors would be more easily managed so I can start testing earlier in the process.</p>
<p>I am using Csla provided compression.&nbsp; It is also possible that I was not referencing the right Csla dll in my different projects. Well! It&#39;s once more with feeling.</p>
<p>Thanks for you help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Thursday, July 22, 2010</h2><p>Well, one thing is clear, this is the correct form</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contract=&quot;WcfPortal.IWcfPortal&quot; name=&quot;BasicHttpBinding_IWcfPortal&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>I am getting the same exact error. <br />May be the Csla Libraries in different projects are not right.<br /><br />My&nbsp;three Business Libraries reference the Silverlight\Csla.dll in the Client Projects, and Server\Csla dll in the Server Projects.<br />Compression projects do the same in the Client and Server projects.<br />Silverlight project references&nbsp; Silverlight\Csla.dll&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Silverlight\Csla.Xaml.dll <br />Web project references Server\Csla and Server\Csla.Web<br />I have a couple of code support projects that reference Server\Csla.</p>
<p>While typing all this I have realized that I do not reference anything from the Client folder.</p>
<p>Perhaps the next option is to create a totally new Solution using VS10, SL4, Net4, Csla4; and then first make sure the Client side can talk to Server side. <br />Can&#39;t say that the thought is pleasant in any way shape or form.&nbsp; But a person&#39;s gotta do what a person&#39;s gotta do.&nbsp; But I have to admit, I would love for someone to stop me. Call me stupid if you want to - I won&#39;t mind. At All.</p>

<p>Right now I have a simple SL page which used CslaDataProvider which make a call withoout any parameters for a small set of values from the database.&nbsp; When I run it without compression, I see the data being displayed properly.&nbsp; When I do it through compression, I get this error:</p>

<p>The same Compression projects were working fine right through VS10, Net4, SL4, Csla3.8.4 handling significant amounts of data back and forth.&nbsp; I am not sure if this represents the root of my problem, or merely a secondary issue to crop up due to something new.</p>
<p>Jav</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Saturday, July 24, 2010</h2><p>That wasn&#39;t it.&nbsp; That was because I had forgotten to modify the App.xaml for compression.</p>
<p>But I do see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Sunday, July 25, 2010</h2><p>It took hours of work and a&nbsp;lot of fits and starts with new projects, but I am pretty sure I know&nbsp;what is causing the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is the old crossdomain / clientaccesspolicy issue again.&nbsp; Surprising thing is that this time it is not going to VS10 or to&nbsp;.Net 4.0, or to SL 4.&nbsp; None of those had an issue with my crossdomain.xml.&nbsp; But as soon as I go to Csla 4, everything falls apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; See, I started creating my minimal new projects in VS2008, SL 3 because that&nbsp;seemed logical.&nbsp; Even though the SL part was no more than a CslaDataProvider and simple Server and Client projects patterned after the SimpleApp demo with DataPortal but no DB access.&nbsp; It worked like a charm, and would work fine even after I converted to VS10, SL4&nbsp;&nbsp; But I would run into problems as soon as I plugged in Csla4.&nbsp; I would log in to the Default page, and then go to SL page and like clockwork the error would pop up even with that simple client to server DataPortal access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only wanting to cut short&nbsp;the process from start to the final error, I decided to create the SL project in VS2010, SL 4.&nbsp; Suddenly everything seemed to work after I changed to Csla 4.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t even notice that there was no Default page.&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to add my Busines libraries, expecting the shoe to drop at any moment.&nbsp; My test was still the minimal Client-Server arrangment, but it kept working.&nbsp; I then imported all the SL code, and still no problem.&nbsp; I could now plug in the ViewModels with fictious parameters and the whole SL stuff was loading perfectly from the DB.</p>
<p>Feeling pretty good, turned my attention to the Web project.&nbsp; Where is the Default page I thought.&nbsp; Well no problem I&#39;ll just drag the Default and Login stuff from the old project.&nbsp; All I needed was one final test. I was done for the day.&nbsp; Press F5, select a person from the list, click the button to go to&nbsp;SL page, lean back in the chair, rest the old neck and shoulders.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And then Bamm. &quot;Not so Fast, Fella&quot;, said the big ol&#39; error message.&nbsp; &quot;Not Found, Not Found, everywhere&quot;, I even heard the computer say, Na, Na, Nana, Na&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&#39;t share what I said in response.&nbsp; I wasted no time to undo what I had just done, quickly removing the Default and Login pages.&nbsp; Then I sat there for a few seconds with my finger on F5.&nbsp; I think that pause and the little prayer is what did the trick.&nbsp; Of course the removal of Default and Login pages helped too.&nbsp; My SL page appeared in full glory once more.&nbsp; No nasty errors.</p>
<p>Here is what I have in my crossdomain.xml:<br />&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br />&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM &quot;<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd">http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd</a>&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;allow-http-request-headers-from domain=&quot;*&quot; headers=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;<br />&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt; </p>
<p>and in my clientaccesspolicy.xml<br />&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;<br />&lt;access-policy&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;cross-domain-access&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;policy&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;allow-from http-request-headers=&quot;*&quot;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;domain uri=&quot;<a href="http://*&quot;/">http://*&quot;/</a>&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;domain uri=&quot;<a href="https://*&quot;/">https://*&quot;/</a>&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/allow-from&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;grant-to&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;resource path=&quot;/&quot; include-subpaths=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/grant-to&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/policy&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;/cross-domain-access&gt;<br />&lt;/access-policy&gt;</p>
<p>So now what do we do?&nbsp; The answer to that is way, way above my pay grade.&nbsp; I can&#39;t believe that many others won&#39;t have the same problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, July 25, 2010</h2><p>If you need the cross-domain policy file, that&#39;s a sure sign you aren&#39;t running the SL app from the same web app as the one where the data portal is hosted. Probably your SL project itself is the startup project - in which case VS automatically creates a temporary web project (without you seeing it) to host the SL app for debugging.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Sunday, July 25, 2010</h2><p>Rocky, I discovered that I need the crossdomain file months ago, and every thing was working great.&nbsp; But upgrading to Csla 4.0 has made that crossdomain file &quot;ineffective&quot;.&nbsp; I have to run the SL app from within an ASP.net App where the user can log in and perform a lot of other&nbsp;functions in plain old Asp.net forms.</p>
<p>The questions that I have now are: 1. Why does moving to Csla 4 topples the apple cart, so to speak?&nbsp; 2. What steps can I take to get my project functioning. 3. Is there some change I can make to the crossdomain file that will make it work.</p>
<p>Do I have to just go back to Csla 3.8.4 and stop making fuss <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" />?</p>
<p>Jav</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Sunday, July 25, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;ve been skimming through the posts, and&nbsp;there is a piece which&nbsp;isn&#39;t clear to me. I&#39;ve gathered you&#39;re using SL4, and that you upgraded Csla from 3.8.&nbsp; Did you at the same time from from SL 3 to SL4?&nbsp; Sorry, I realize you most likely already thought of this, but through I&#39;d throw it out on the slim chance you hadn&#39;t. :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>Jav replied on Sunday, July 25, 2010</h2><p>Phew!&nbsp; Finally got it working - and no it wasn&#39;t Csla 4.0 it was configuration issue (funny, it seems like I heard that somewhere).&nbsp; But I&#39;ll say one thing - It&#39;s a jungle out there.&nbsp; These are some notes I like to share hopefully to help someone else.</p>
<p>With Three Business Libraries and an SL project, I only have four ServiceReferences.ClientConfig files.&nbsp; In&nbsp;VS08, SL3, Net3.5, &nbsp;I simply copied one properly created .ClientConfig file in each of the four places without messing with Service References in each project; and it worked fine. Not anymore, or so it seems.&nbsp; I checked my ClientConfigs over and over again.&nbsp; Couldn&#39;t find anything wrong - but the project wouldn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>So I decided to use the Service References item to create them.&nbsp; I am sure for a normal web service this process will work fine, but trying to create it for WcfPortal, invariably will mess everything up.&nbsp; You then have to go clean it all up manually, especially the Contract and the Name of the Reference.&nbsp; I created Service References and made sure my ClientConfigs weren&#39;t screwed up .&nbsp; I clicked in each service reference and looked it up in the object browser, and everything looked fine.&nbsp; But none of that helped.</p>
<p>Having nothing else to do, I almost aimlessly right clicked on the ServiceReference&nbsp; (Not the .ClientConfig file, but the reference).&nbsp; Of the three items in that drop down, I had already used &quot;Update Service Reference&quot; and &quot;View in Object Browser&quot;, so I selected &quot;<strong>Configure Service Reference</strong>&quot;.&nbsp; The dialog opened, and there&nbsp;didn&#39;t appear to be anything&nbsp;relevant.&nbsp; As I was about to close the dialog when&nbsp;I glanced at the Address field and almost fell out of my chair.&nbsp; Folks, the address in the field was that of the very original address allocated to the Web Project (localhost:1816) when the Solution was created.&nbsp; Since creating the Solution I had transfered the web over to IIS.&nbsp; It was lucky that I had clicked on the ClientConfig in the SL project, because the other three references were just fine.</p>
<p>Moral:&nbsp; When checking your Web Addresses in the ClientConfig files, don&#39;t forget to look at the Address in the Service Reference by clicking Configure Service References.</p>
<p>Jav</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 26, 2010</h2><p>I have no idea what you are talking about with adding service references and so forth.</p>
<p>If you are using the data portal, the service references are already set up, you just need to add configuration <i>to your main SL app project</i> so the client can find the server.</p>
<p>Of course if you&#39;ve created your own custom proxy/host that doesn&#39;t use the existing data portal interface (you didn&#39;t subclass the CSLA proxy/host classes) then you absolutely would need to do some service reference work - but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you did?</p>
<p>Somehow I think things have gone off the rails for you, and the answer is almost certainly much simpler than what it sounds like you are doing.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
