In order to speed the perceived load time, I wanted to cache some of my picklists (that are used by every user) behind the login form. So basically, this would be happening on a different thread at the same time the user is typing in their credentials. The only problem with this is that there is no authenticated user at the time that I need to load these objects.<br><br>Is what I am trying to do a bad idea? Should I just wait until I have an authenticated user or is there a way to skirt the authentication for a couple of generally used objects so I can get them cached before the user actually logs in and needs them?<br><br>Mike<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, December 08, 2007</h2><P>Assuming <EM>anyone</EM> can get those objects, then you could do what I do in PTWin and have the application "logout" as its first step. That establishes a valid, but unauthenticated, principal for the UI thread.</P>
<P>Of course if you are using a different thread anyway, then that thread wouldn't have the normal principal anyway. So when you spin up that thread you can establish a valid, unauthenticated principal on that thread before loading the objects.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
