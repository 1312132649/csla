<p>For me it worked well.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>San replied on Monday, March 25, 2013</h2><p>I am new to CSLA, can you please explain how to use parent in child object?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>neo_u replied on Monday, March 25, 2013</h2><p>Then I can suggest to read the books about Csla. Because this books will explain the main idea of Csla, how to use it and main concepts...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, March 25, 2013</h2><p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general - you may wan to reconsider flattening your object structure or apply special handling for rechecking when the parent property is changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CSLA rule engine will re-validate affected properties or properties that has the &quot;changed property&quot; as an input property BUT only with the object. IE when you have dependencies on a parent property you must add code to re-validate the child properties when parent property is changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the books and videos on CSLA 4!!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
