<P>I have been using CSLA for a while on the Winforms side and love it. But now I'm forced to jump into the asp.net waggon and build a web site. </P>
<P>I decided to use CSLA 3.5 for my business layer and am just learning how to do so on asp.net. The first issue I have is with boxing a grid view in another grid view (kind of master/child) using CSLADataSource.</P>
<P>What I did is I defined both CSLADataSource controls on the web form binding the master DataSource to my topmost grid and this works fine.</P>
<P>Then I placed my second grid inside the ItemTemplate of a TemplateField of the master grid. Now I use the RowDataBound Event of the master grid to keep track of it's key so I can filter the resulting data in the SelectObject Event of my child CSLADataSource. </P>
<P>The problem now is that it seems that the SelectObject Event of the child data source is raised BEFORE the RowDataBound Event of the master grid. </P>
<P>Am I using it the wrong way? Can I influence the order of events raised?</P>
<P>Thanks for any answer</P>
<P>Mike</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
