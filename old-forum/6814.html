Can Save, Cancel.<br /><br />List Form - Items List Screen with a Grid. Can Ok, Cancel.<br /><br />In terms of BindingSources, I believe all I need is one BindingSource on the Detail Screen. Were I am running into problems is on the List Form. Do I use one BindingSource and bind to the Child Collection? Or do I need two BindingSources, one for the parent and one for the child collection even though I am only editing the child collection. <br /><br />Any ideas/tips/samples or pointers to a book excerpt is appreciated.<br /><br />Edit: Forgot to mention, the problems I am seeing are errors with the edit levels.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Adalton4 replied on Monday, April 20, 2009</h2>Same scenario, (also mentioned in another post,) same problems with editlevels,... anyone?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
