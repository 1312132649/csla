<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>We run our applications exclusively within a Citrix environment and the process you have outlined is exactly how we get our applications up and running.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I can't comment on exactly what it is our IT Staff do to get everything working, but to us developers it is as simple as providing them with the bits (msi or whatever) and they "make it run".</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>If you do run into any problems, please let us know.&nbsp; Perhaps there are some gotchas out there that we have not yet run into.</FONT></P>
