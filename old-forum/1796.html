<P>What I end up with is an Estimate summary report showing all of the departments and aggregates for the first department being displayed in all the other departments, which is to be expected given that the only way I can access the Drawing objects is via the Drawings myDwgs = Estimate.Department[0].Drawing statement.&nbsp; Is there any way to force the MS report to iterate through each child Drawing object when it iterates from one Department object to another?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, November 20, 2006</h2><P>I would not expect report binding to work in this case. But there is no reason you cannot use your BO data to create a "flatter" representation that the report can bind to. e.g. Build a dataset from your BO data and bind the report to that. Or build 2 new BOs from the data that the report can bind to directly.</P>
