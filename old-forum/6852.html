<P><FONT face=Arial>I was concerned about the preformance we were experiencing fetching about 5 rows of data.&nbsp; The Silverlight page was displayed quickly, but the data refreshed about 2.5 seconds later.&nbsp; We are using CSLA, Silverlight and LINQ connected to a SQL Server Database.&nbsp; The delay is seen in when the "Default Browser" is Firefox.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Intersestingly the same code running under Inernet-Explorer is performant in that there is no obvious delay on data read to the user.&nbsp; I have not profiled this to find the&nbsp;cause, but thought it may save someone some time when investingating performance</FONT></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
