I downloaded the latest translations of resources files but do not see one for that language. Does anyone happen to know if one is available.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 13, 2007</h2>There is a zh-CHS file, which I believe is Simplified Chinese. That's the only Chinese resource file that's ever been contributed.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BillyM replied on Thursday, September 13, 2007</h2><P>Thanks, Rocky. I missed that one (was looking for something like Resources.cn.resx).</P>
<P>FYI, I am fairly new to your framework but must say that what I have seen so far is amazing... solves many issues we have struggled with for years... wish I had looked into this long ago.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>neu_dancer replied on Friday, September 14, 2007</h2><P>Welcome you to join us.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, I don't actually speak Chinese myself (lol)... but fortunately, my partners do (they are Chinese and setting up contacts for us there). I will have them check out your blog.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
