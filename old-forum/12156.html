<p>I&#39;m sure what I need to do is fairly simple - but since it&#39;s an older version, finding the right documentation is next to impossible.</p>
<p>What&#39;s happening is that my call to a business object method is running locally instead of using the remote version. </p>
<p>Now I&#39;m playing with different approaches (such as setting up weird constructs in the save) but all I want to do is call a method and be sure it&#39;s going to run on the server rather than the local connection.</p>
<p>Can anyone help here?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, September 20, 2013</h2><p>I&#39;ll assume that your application uses DataPortal and is configured to use remoting. </p>
<p>Basically - any call that is expected to go to the server must call the DataPortal.XYZ methods and the implementation must not have the [RunLocal] attribute applied as this will the DataPortl to run the method locally. </p>
<p>So verify that:</p>
<ul>
<li>your Save method calls the (BusinessBase).Save() method (that in turn calls DataPortal.Update/Insert/Delete based on the metastate of the object)</li>
<li>make sure that [RunLocal] attribute is not applied to the DataPortal_XYZ methods in your code.</li>
<li>make sure your DataPortal is configured to use a remote server.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;right documentation&quot; is readily available. </p>
