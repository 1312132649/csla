<p>If I have the option should I copy CSLA and let the Mobile Formatter to do it or just let the standard serialization process do it?&nbsp; Would I see any performance gains?</p>

<p>In general, if you need to do something like this, it&#39;s better to develop a separate serialization format that captures the data you need.&nbsp; The trick is developing a format that&#39;s forgiving to change, since you still have the versioning issue to contend with.&nbsp; But it&#39;s easier to contend with than trying to write out your CSLA object graph as-is.</p>
<p>If your caching&nbsp;needs are&nbsp;just a per-session kind of thing, is there a reason static variables don&#39;t do the trick?</p>
<p>HTH</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking at caching data that really won&#39;t change very often, is really simple, and in the event of an application re-build can be simply blown away.&nbsp; It is all read-only application data and lookup codes etc.&nbsp; I have some clients with horrendous internet connections so I&#39;m trying to alleviate as much over the wire as possible.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been playing with the Sterling DB which works great for non-CSLA objects but I&#39;m having issues plugging in the mobileFormatter as a custom serializer.</p>
<p>I may take you advice and ditch CSLA objects for a lot of this data and make it simpler.</p>
