I have done (most) of this. &lt;g&gt;</P>
<P>I took a Foxpro app and made a Web version of it. It needed to work on Oracle and SQL Server.</P>
<P>I did not make a WInForms interface though. Yet most CSLA users have done it. The point is the same BOs will work for either Win or Web environment.</P>
<P>For Citrix clients you may want to keep using it or use a Web interface. I don't think you should try Remoting over the Internet.</P>

<P>FWIW on the network and remoting / ws options:</P>
<P>I have an app not using CSLA and using webservices acrros firewalls etc....</P>
<P>works wvery well as long as you keep the server stateless and handle network problems in the client.</P>
<P>if you can use click once you can update clients very easy and not have to ship updates on cd to them.</P>
<P>I have a fair number of end users who are not very computer savy and it's been about 10 months.</P>
<P>upgrades have been good, the #1 errors are generaly a connection was closed or a dns can't find hostname, a few related ones like them.</P>
<P>say 5 errors that all go back to "the internet is not perfect" try again.</P>
<P>trap them and things are not bad -- and you don't have the hassles of running Citrix etc...</P>
<P>I am looking at moving a bunch of the web service code to WCF using TCP later as I think that will make for faster system perf etc....</P>
<P>but for now ws is doing the job.</P>
<P>1 sql , 1 iis server to about 200 clients doing over 10,000 ws calls a day 6 days a week for 10 months.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>YMMV</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
