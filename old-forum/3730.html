<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In PTTracker sample when we make&nbsp; PTWin project as startup&nbsp;and when we are executing it its fetching the data from the library and displaying without any error but when we make PTServiceclient as a startup project and when we execute through the webservice its giving error saying</P>
<P>""System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException: Server was unable to process request. ---&gt; System.Exception: DataPortal.Fetch failed\n&nbsp;&nbsp; at Service""</P>
<P>We have also created VrtualDirectory in IIS for the WebService.</P>

<P>Did you read all of that before trying?</P>
<P>There are many things in PT that are for demo purposes only. e.g. The use of Enterprise Services. If you don't need it then you need to make some modifications before running it. If you do, then you have to register stuff.</P>
