<P>Firstly, Thanks CSLA team.</P>
<P>Now, I am try to use CSLA framework to build my new project. In my project these is parent(Member) table and Address children. From these days learnt, I know CSLA can do the transaction at database layer, but I still want to move it to the business layer, how to do? can you give me a example?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Wednesday, May 16, 2007</h2><P>Are you saying you'd like your business object to be transactional - i.e. the business object and all its children would track the original values and have a mechanism of writing them back to the database if something went wrong?</P>
<P>But why?</P>
<P>Generally speaking, I think you need to let the database do what it does best and not mess with it.&nbsp; If my description is correct, what are you going to do if there's a failure on one of the writes to reset to original values?&nbsp; You're in deep trouble, whereas, in contrast, that is precisely the point of database transactions.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, May 16, 2007</h2>I think what you'll want to do is use Clone to clone the BO you are to save, then call save on the clone.&nbsp; If successfuly, you replace to original BO with the BO returned from the clones Save method.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
