In the CSLA 3.0 I use the snippet code bellow with success<br><br>void SwapItem(int i, int j)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp; (i != j)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C temp = this.Items<img src="/emoticons/emotion-55.gif" alt="Idea [I]" />;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.Items<img src="/emoticons/emotion-55.gif" alt="Idea [I]" /> = this.Items[j];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.Items[j] = temp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>}<br><br>But I see in CSLA 3.5 the code to Insert/Remove item is much more complicated because of Linq support. And maybe that above snippet code is not properly. Anyone has idea to implement Swap method for BusinessListBase?<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonStonecash replied on Saturday, July 05, 2008</h2>This looks very much like you are sorting the list.&nbsp; You might want to take a look at the CSLA SortedBindingList.&nbsp; This is a wrapper class around the BusinessListBase&lt;TList, TItem&gt;.&nbsp; You can control the sort order (which need not be a strict ascending or descending order).&nbsp; This class can be used any where that the BusinessList class can be used.&nbsp; You could inherit from SortedBindingList, add your swap functionality, and avoid adding and removing items from the list.<br><br>Jon Stonecash<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Cuong replied on Sunday, July 06, 2008</h2>Yes, the purpose of Swap method is to let user sort BusinessListBase manually. User can click Up/Down button to move selected items Up/Down. I just tried to use SortedBinddingList to implement the Swap method. This solution breaks a little bit of my previous app design but it fits my need. Thank you very much.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
