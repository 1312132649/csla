<p>1. I launch the add data source wizard on the windows project.</p>
<p>2. select object type</p>
<p>3. select the library object from the list</p>
<p>4. Click Finish and nothing happens. &nbsp;No data source is added nor do I get any error of any kind.</p>
<p>Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.</p>

I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m simply overlooking something but this is very frustrating.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>comptech99 replied on Thursday, July 29, 2010</h2><p>I knew this was something simple and stupid. &nbsp;MyProject.Library project was set to x64 and the MyProject.Win was set to AnyCPU. &nbsp;I guess this matters a lot. &nbsp;Anyways, just in case someone else runs into this type of issue.</p>
