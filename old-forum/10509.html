At first&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought my problem was&nbsp;with saving grandchild objects, but&nbsp;I think&nbsp;the problem lies&nbsp;in&nbsp;correctly databinding&nbsp;grandchild objects.&nbsp;Here is the scenario..</p>
<p>Parent(&nbsp;BB)</p>
<p>---&gt; ChildList(BLB) &gt; Child(BB)</p>
<p>--&gt; --&gt; GrandChildList(BLB) &gt; Grandchild</p>
<p>My parent winpart control accepts a Parent object and databinds to controls. The child object databinds to a datarepeater control. when the index of the child datarepeater changes I get the current child and bind the child.grandchildList to a second datarepeater. This all works well</p>
<p>I seemed to add and remove grandchild objects correctly, as they were added and removed from the datarepeated, but when i saved the parent the grandchild objects didn&#39;t save. Upon futher debuging i found that the newly added grandchild was not in the parent.child.grandchildlist. and the parent.childlist.indexOf() always returns a -1. </p>
<p>So in this scenario what is the correct way to interact with the grandchild objects?</p>
<p>thanks.</p>
<p>PS. I&#39;m using CLSA 3.8.x and i&#39;ve followed the ProjectTracker winpart control extactly. </p>
