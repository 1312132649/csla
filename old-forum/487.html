<P>I am currently in the process designing a&nbsp;web application and researching the different architectural methods availble (OO frameworks versus home grown OO design).&nbsp; I am trying not to spend too much time on this because it is more important to work on the business logic.&nbsp; The application I am designing is 3 tier application (presentation, domain and data access) that will use SQL 2005 as a backend and will integrate with third party applications via web services and HTTPS post (vendors interface not our choice).&nbsp; This application is not over complicated with having 100's of business objects and 100's of web forms.&nbsp; I would put the complexity in the middle with an emphasis on performance and security.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Is CSLA.Net worth a look for my app?&nbsp; <BR>Is the performance of the framwork worth of production?</P>
<P>I understand with very little background on my app it will be hard to guide me.&nbsp; I am curious about other user experiences with CSLA.Net.</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, June 28, 2006</h2>I'm using Csla in a production application right now, which most people on this site are.<br><br>Plenty of other people <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=a26b2727-f99d-485b-aa3e-a5466e534a2b">think</a> so as well.<br><br>I would defaintly say look into Csla; much of the point of the framework is to allow you to focus on business code instead of the plumping.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
