<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>Someone told me that IIS is slow and maybe would not be a good solution for hosting the server side of a distributed application ; that it would be better to have a application running as a service. And beside that, we do not need some features of IIS, as identification, security, and the like.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>Well, I am a little sceptic and I’ll run tests. But if you have any thoughts about that, I’ll read them with interest.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
