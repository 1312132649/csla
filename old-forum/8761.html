<p>I&#39;ve found other Silverlight technologies can often be adapted for use on NetCF -- they share similar limitations.&nbsp; Is this one of those cases?&nbsp; Has anybody given it a try?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not looked to see what size project this would be or if it would even be reasonable.&nbsp; Anybody have a feel for that?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 05, 2010</h2><p>I suspect it would be possible, but I&#39;ve never scoped it in detail. My estimate is between 3 and 8 weeks of work for someone intimately familiar with how CSLA is implemented.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.welling replied on Monday, April 05, 2010</h2><p>That&#39;s intriguing for us.&nbsp; We do a large number of custom projects using the Compact Framework, and with WP7&#39;s limited multitasking capabilities (and the inertia of enterprise class device providers), I suspect we will continue to use the compact framework for at least 2 more years.</p>
<p>I will propose this for investigation and scheduling after our current engagement (probably sometime in May).&nbsp; Let me know if you have any interest in the code if we move forward.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 05, 2010</h2><p>The previous CE implementation was donated by someone who was in much the same position as you from the sound of it.</p>
<p>If you are successful and are willing to donate the results back to the community I am sure it would be very well received.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to copy the existing CSLA .NET for Silverlight project into a different folder, but with the same relative location to the CSLA .NET for Windows code so all the file links remain intact. Then switch the project to a CF project. Or if that&#39;s not possible, then create the CF project in the same way (relative folder structure and linked files) we did with Silverlight.</p>
<p>In CSLA 4 I&#39;ve continued to eliminate files from the SL codebase, linking more and more from core CSLA. I suspect, given time, there&#39;ll be almost no physical files in the SL project. Or the reverse perhaps - the SL project might become the core project and the .NET code will be linked to SL - assuming SL becomes as dominant as I think it will over the next 3-4 years.</p>
<p>Anyway, the fewer files that are duplicated the better from a maintainability perspective is what I&#39;m trying to say <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.welling replied on Monday, April 05, 2010</h2><p>Agreed.&nbsp; If we are able to do this, we will make every effort to maintain the same code structure/linking approach.&nbsp; The less real differences in code, the more likely the branch will remain healthy I guess.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 05, 2010</h2><p>fwiw, the CSLA 4 folder and projects structures are much neater and cleaner than 3.8. It may be unrealistic for you to work with the newer code, but it is something to consider perhaps.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
