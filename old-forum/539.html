<P>Finally, I threw out the Atlas library into the trash, emptied the trash, and squashed it with my foot for good measure.&nbsp; Suddenly, I see all (I think) of my hundreds of objects along with Csla objects in the drop down list.&nbsp; Now go figure!&nbsp; I am using Csla 2.0.1</P>

<P>Then I deleted the Atlas library from the bin directory (without uninstalling Atlas), and noticed that a number of my objects began to appear in the dropdown list.&nbsp; I then quit VS, deleted the _shadow folder related to my website - (which I had done a few times before also without benefit), uninstalled Atlas and restarted VS.&nbsp; Since then practically all of my objects are in the list, and I can select them and do DataBinding.</P>
