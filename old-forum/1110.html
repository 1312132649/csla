<P>I have compiled the CSLA framework in release mode and reference the release dll from my projects but when debugging my apps, each time my code calls into the CSLA framework, the debugger jumps into the CSLA code.</P>
<P>How can I stop the CSLA framework source code being available while i'm debugging my apps?</P>
<P>I'm using VS.NET 2005 Pro with CSLA 2.0.3</P>
<P>TIA for any help</P>

<P>I tried removing the .pdb files from both my project bin directory and the CSLA project bin directory but this has no effect.</P>
<P>I'm sure there must be a way to compile without debug symbols but I can't find seem to find how.</P>
<P>Any ideas?</P>

<P>1.Open the CSLA framework solution.</P>
<P>2. Right click on the Csla project and select properties.</P>
<P>3. Select the Build tab.</P>
<P>4. Set the Configuration dropdown to "Release".</P>
<P>5. Click the Advanced tab.</P>
<P>6. Set the Debug Info to "none".</P>
<P>7. Recompile the Csla framework.</P>
<P>8. Open your own project.</P>
<P>9. Right clickyour project in Solution Explorer and select "Clean".</P>
<P>10. Recompile your project.</P>
<P>Now you can debug your project without stepping into the Csla framework code.</P>
<P>Hope this helps someone else.</P>
