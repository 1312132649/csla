<P>This would effectively block everyone, since that role has no members.</P>
<P>Then you could later do AllowWrite("AdminRole") to allow that specifc role to also have access.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, June 20, 2007</h2>I thought about that too, but I choose the DenyWrite method to make it more clear what I was trying to acomplish.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
