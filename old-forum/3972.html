<P>What is the best way of using <SPAN id=google-navclient-hilite><SPAN id=google-navclient-hilite><SPAN id=google-navclient-hilite>CSLA</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> in the above scenario, I understand to all server operations it can still hold, but the client server communications are going to suffer...</P>
<P>Any recommendations, is using a SOAP library that is WS compliant (like gSoap) is the way to go?</P>

WCF can be (and is by default) SOAP compliant, so WCF services can be consumed by any reputable web service stack.</P>
<P>Chapter 11 in the <EM>Expert 2005 Business Objects</EM> book discusses web services, and the concepts apply to WCF services too. The <EM>Using CSLA .NET 3.0</EM> ebook discusses the specific implementation details of using WCF. I'd also recommend Juval Lowy's WCF book, as it is quite good.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
