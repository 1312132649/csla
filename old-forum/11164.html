<p>nearly a year ago I underwent the step to walk the SL-path. Meanwhile I&#39;m happy to have done so, since I think SL has much potential to outclass winforms in terms of great UI&#39;s. (THAT and not architectural reasons in first line&nbsp;are imho most important for a UI-technology, since UI should present the &quot;window&quot; to our users and are not primarily a dev&#39;s- toy <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink" /> )<br />Working with SL and intentionally ignoring MVVM not to add further stuff to the learning stack, I found myself writing more and more&nbsp;separate classes to which controls are bound beside my CSLA-business objects. You know, classes with properties like &#39;canProceed&#39; that enable buttons if certain conditions are true and so on. Sounds like a natural way to a VM, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>OK, I should give MVVM a try. But a lot of questions arouse, reading the first samples:</p>
<p>1) Who is responsible to trigger things like an animation? Let me give you two samples:<br />a) a certain BO-property drives the visibility state of an image (via value converter bool-&gt;visibility) But as soon as the image is shown, it should pulse let&#39;s say 5 times to makes sure the user really sees it. Actual I trigger the animation through code behind (the cause of all evil, I know)<br />b) I animate appearance and disappearance of views, but not all the same in a standard way but according to actual data. So a detail view of an item in a listbox zooms in (and out, of course)&nbsp;from the position where the item is, not just from the middle of nowhere...</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) BxF (what&#39;s with other MVVM frameworks?) has the conception of a shell. OK all SL-apps must have RootVisual, but that doesn&#39;t have to be a view. In my case it&#39;s a stupid grid. There I load a login-view which doesn&#39;t contain anything else but login-related controls. No menu, status or similar. That only comes into play when there was a succesfull login. (Did I mention that since it&#39;s a LOB-app, no unauthenticated user-access is allowed?) Furthermore even the loaded views have regions where they can load other (detail)views... From all I read, BxF may be a little to basic?</p>
<p>At the bottom line I ask myself the following question: Is usage of MVVM-pattern (and certain frameworks)&nbsp;capable of supporting UI&#39;s that are &quot;heavily designed&quot; or does it restrict UI-design?&nbsp;In case of the second I&#39;ll drop MVVM, since this would definitly limit SL&#39;s potential.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharong your thoughts!</p>

<p>I have not done a lot with animation at this point, so I can&#39;t speak to that.&nbsp; However, I have seen some of Rocky&#39;s examples that include basic animation (like the busy indicator) which is easily handled&nbsp;without code-behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding code-behind, I know Rocky&#39;s stated goal is zero code behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve done&nbsp;everything I can do adhere to that and have succeeded in most of my views.&nbsp; But I&#39;ve also read a bit from others who aren&#39;t as strict in their desire for getting rid of code behind.&nbsp; Their take is that if code behind is necessary <em>and</em> it doesn&#39;t involve business logic, then it isn&#39;t completely evil.&nbsp; That is kind of freeing to me.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding MVVM frameworks,&nbsp;I used Bxf for learning and it was great for that purpose.&nbsp; I&#39;m now learning Caliburn.Micro (as I had seen others talk about that here) and so far I like what I see.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
