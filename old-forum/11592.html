<p>Am I missing something?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, September 23, 2012</h2><p>Due to lack of interest in WF in general, and the fact that there was little valuable functionality in Csla.Workflow, I&#39;ve basically dropped that assembly.</p>
<p>This was a choice I made last year sometime, because it would have required work to get it functional for WF 4 and I thought I&#39;d see if anyone noticed it wasn&#39;t updated.</p>
<p>Here we are, and you are the first to notice :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, September 23, 2012</h2><p>I should make it clear though, that CSLA 4 works just fine with WF 4. If you want to use CSLA business objects from workflow activities/tasks, that is no problem and works great.</p>
<p>So the only thing you don&#39;t get from Csla.Workflow were a couple half-baked wrappers that make it slightly easier to launch a workflow. Really not the kind of thing that belongs in CSLA in the first place, but something I put in back in the 3.0 and 3.5 days because I found them useful for demos.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Monday, September 24, 2012</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b>

<p>I noticed it not because I need it or use it . I was updating the dependencies directory of CslaContrib samples from 4.3.12 to 4.3.13. As I couldn&#39;t find it on NuGet, I was forced to use the installer MSI. It is indeed on the installer MSI.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
