<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have a form with a cslaActionExtender and the form property ControlBox set to false. Whenever I call ResetActionBehaviors(myBO) on cslaActionExtender, it seems to complete whatever it must do. However, after it exits the method, the form will close.&nbsp;I debugged the entire flow, and although there are references to "close the current form" in cslaActionExtender, they get never called, and this is also not the intention. None of my buttons are attached to a 'Close' action.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Has anybody else experienced this problem or tried to do this? This seems like a common scenario to me.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
