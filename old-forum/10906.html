<p>I have a Business Object Company with child objects Fees which of of type List&lt;Fee&gt;</p>
<p>In my View when i change the Fee, the &#39;Save&#39; button (which is bound to &#39;CanSave&#39;) doesn&#39;t enable. But when i do save the root object and call the FieldManager.UpdateChildren() it in fact does have the changes and saves it to the DB correctly. I&#39;ve had a read about the ChildChanged event but am unsure of how to implement it.</p>
<p>Can someone please point in the right direction?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>StefanCop replied on Tuesday, November 22, 2011</h2><p>This post might help you <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/10819.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/10819.aspx</a>.</p>
