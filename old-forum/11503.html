<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My application has a user db witch authenticates trough competences instead of roles. </p>
<p>Now my question is can i modify the Framework so it does it for me just like the isInRole Authentication?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ex. HasCompetence(order)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thx</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, July 24, 2012</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>read this blogpost from rocky:&nbsp;http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/PermissionbasedAuthorizationVsRolebasedAuthorization.aspx&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tobique replied on Tuesday, July 24, 2012</h2><p>Thx I&#39;ll try this then, any Tips for helping me load the permissions instead of the roles? or do I just edit use the CSLAPrincipal and CSLAIdendity as base classes and edit witch information is loaded.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>vschaak replied on Wednesday, July 25, 2012</h2><p>Hi Tobique,</p>
<p>first of all, you may probably want to inherit form cslaIdentityBase, since you&#39;ll be able to add properties and functionality. For example properties like &#39;realName&#39; or &#39;PWDExpired&#39; or a functionality to change password, just to name some.</p>
<p>In the process of fetching uservalidation-data from your DB, you&#39;re free then to retrieve your list of permissions, eventually as a list of strings as a simple approach and add them to the CSLA-Roles, which is something like a mobileList(of string), if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all. You only have to take care not to puzzle things, as many authorization-systems use Roles (&#39;Salesmanager&#39; or &#39;admin&#39;&nbsp;as an example)&nbsp;to group permissions (&#39;EditThis&#39; or &#39;deleteThat&#39; for example)&nbsp;and/or users. In such environment one has to be clear, that those Roles are only to simplify permission and/or user-managment and have no direct relevance for your authorization object, which only has to know about permissions, not roles! Therefore your DB-query to fetch your Identity-class should retrieve permissions to add them to the CSLA-roles, no roles, if present in your authorization-system.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!?</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
