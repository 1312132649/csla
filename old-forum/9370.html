<p>Parts of my object graph are created/fetched at the outset, and parts will be lazy-loaded (and are not even implemented yet).&nbsp;&nbsp;All child object&nbsp;VMs are created using a constructor that is sent the object as&nbsp;a parameter.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Right now there is only one BusinessListBase collection, and that is giving me an error.&nbsp; The error says &quot;<strong>BeginEdit is not valid on a child object</strong>&quot; and occures when VM&#39;s Model property is set to my List in the ViewModelBase.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see in SlDemo the EmployeeListViewModel being created with the Parameterless constructor using BeginRefresh(&quot;GetEmployeeList&quot;);&nbsp; </p>
<p>The phrase BeginEdit does not even&nbsp;occur anywhere in my solution.&nbsp; Is there something wrong with my List that is generating this error?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, August 13, 2010</h2><p>ViewModelBase defaults to ManageObjectLifetime=true, which means it calls BeginEdit/CancelEdit/ApplyEdit on your behalf. You can set ManageObjectLifetime=false in your constructor to prevent this behavior, which is usually what you want to do for anything other than the root object - and you want to set it to false for a root object if your UI has no concept of a cancel button.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Friday, August 13, 2010</h2><p>Fantastic.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; That makes perfect sense.</p>
