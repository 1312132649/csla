For example if your class derives from BusinessListBase, you can call .Add or .AddNew. The new item is in memory until you call .Save to persist to the DB.</P>

I started using CSLA with 2.something. Sorry, maybe someone else knows.</P>

I don't know how 1.x worked as I never used it.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 07, 2007</h2>Ok, well the concept is the same, and either way nothing should be saving to the database until you call save.&nbsp; Check out the example that came with whatever version of Csla you downloaded.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
