For Save, I can hook into the DataChanged event. However, when I Undo, or Cancel edits, the DataChanged event does not get raised. My form has ListBoxes that contain sorted views of child collections. These are not automatically refreshed on Cancel. How can I hook into the Cancel logic of the Command Manager so I can refresh the views of the ListBoxes to reflect the restored business object state?</P>
