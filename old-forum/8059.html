I and my team been doing this since way back when without issue, until now.<br /><br />On the build machine it works just fine (Server 2008 R2 64-Bit with VS 2008 SP1)??<br /><br />Strangly on all the other computers Visual Studio just abruptly dissappears from the screen (instantly and without a crash report that usually follows). This happens the instance when you OK the browse dialog that add's the new assembly to the toolbox.<br /><br />Sure enough there are a few posts on the web about similar behaviour. The various solutions range from running DevEnv /SafeMode and resetting the toolbox, to more extreme /ResetSettings etc. Also tried clearing the various bin/obj and other locations where assemblies are cached. Nothing worked.<br /><br />Then, we tried to add a previous version of CSLA 3.8.0 Alpha 1 and it worked perfectly. Tried again with 3.8.1 and it just crashed as before.<br /><br />This might just be an issue with our environment (not that I can figure it out) but has anyone experienced anything similar?<br /><br />Could there have been changes to CSLA build that may be the culprit?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br />Jaans</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, November 28, 2009</h2><P>Which controls are you adding to the Toolbox?</P>
<P>3.8 has no changes to Windows Forms or Web Forms controls - only WPF controls were changed/added, and I don't think they show up in the Toolbox until VS10.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, November 28, 2009</h2><P>fwiw, I just added 3.8.1 to my toolbox with no problem.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jaans replied on Saturday, November 28, 2009</h2>Thanks for that Rocky<br /><br />Ps: I'm adding all the Web/Windows Forms controls - nothing new really.<br /><br />Must be something in the environment - though is it strange that its not happening with the old assembly.<br /><br />Will post if I find the solution.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cdkisa replied on Monday, November 30, 2009</h2>I had a similar problem. The solution is to start VS in safe mode and then add the controls. I think it only applies in 2008.<br /><br />"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" /safemode</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Raul Perez replied on Friday, January 08, 2010</h2>I had the same problem in normal or safemode, when select the csla.dll.<br><br>I have solved it, installing VisualStudio 2008 SP1<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jaans replied on Friday, January 08, 2010</h2><P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Hi Raul</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Was it a case of Installing VS 2008 SP1 because it was not previously installed, or was it a case of re-installing an already installed SP1?</FONT></P>
