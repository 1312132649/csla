<p>Several people have suggested that they&#39;d be interested in buying access to all content I product for a period of time, or for a CSLA version or something like that. I am considering such an offering, but haven&#39;t worked out the details quite yet.</p>
<p>I am actively working on the ebook series. I&#39;ll probably sell the ebooks per-book and also have an option to purchase the series (even before it is complete). The series won&#39;t be complete until the end of the year, or maybe even into early 2011.</p>
<p>I am hoping to find time between ebooks to create some more video content as well. I think the two are very complimentary. Again, I might figure out some package pricing for this, but I haven&#39;t worked it out quite yet.</p>
<p>Not a definitive answer, sorry, but it is what I have just now.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
