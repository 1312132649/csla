<p>I am pleased to announce the first beta release of CSLA 4 version 4.1 with 
support for Windows Phone 7, and continuing support for .NET 4 and Silverlight 
4.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">Download CSLA 4 version 
4.1.0 here</a></p>
<p>With this release, it is now possible to write a single business layer 
composed of business domain objects that run unchanged on a WP7 device, in 
Silverlight, on a Windows client, on Windows Server and on Windows Azure.</p>
<p>The samples download includes Samples\Net\cs\SimpleNTier, which does 
implement the following interfaces over one common business layer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Phone</li>
<li>WPF</li>
<li>Silverlight</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this is just the first beta release, so there&rsquo;s more work to be 
done. At the same time, we have completed the vast majority of the effort, and 
it is quite possible to build WP7 applications using this beta.</p>
<p>As with all CSLA releases, this one does include some bug fixes and 
enhancements to other parts of the framework. Please see the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=9aad2f99-86eb-453b-a760-6303c3b27552">change 
log</a> for a list of all changes. Enhancement highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add ability to get a consolidated list of broken rules for an object 
graph</li>
<li>New BackgroundWorker component that automatically initializes background 
threads with the current principal and culture from the UI thread</li>
<li>TriggerAction provides better debugging information, following the lead of 
many Microsoft XAML controls</li>
<li>and much more&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>In related news, <a href="http://unitdriven.codeplex.com/">UnitDriven</a> has 
also been updated to support WP7, and provides a pretty comprehensive unit test 
runner and framework for WP7 code. CSLA uses UnitDriven for its automated 
testing, but UnitDriven can be used for any application on .NET, Silverlight or 
WP7.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="http://bxf.codeplex.com/">Bxf</a> (Basic XAML Framework) 
has been updated to support WP7, thereby providing a common MVVM framework for 
WPF, Silverlight and WP7 UI development efforts. Some CSLA sample apps use Bxf, 
but Bxf can be used for any application, including those that don&rsquo;t involve CSLA 
at all.</p>
