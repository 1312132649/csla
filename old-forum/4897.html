<P>I need to get a list of user roles, but&nbsp;I could not find a property or function for this purpose, although the Roles are being loaded in the Private Variable "mRoles". Any reason ?</P>
<P>So, I decided to add the following property to the Identity class, in the region <FONT color=#800000 size=2>" IsInRole ":</FONT></P><PRE>        Friend ReadOnly Property Roles() As List(Of String)
            Get
                Return mRoles
            End Get
        End Property
</PRE>
<P>I need to know if this is OK or&nbsp;if there is an&nbsp;alternative.</P>
<P>Why I need such&nbsp;property ?</P>
<P>I am&nbsp;developing a Testing Page, and I need to add a Drop-Down Box to show the List of the Roles for a Selected User. So it does make sense to add such property "Roles()".</P>
<P>I was thinking probably it should be under the Membership Provider, but I was really not sure where is should be added.</P>
<P>Please let me know your feedback.</P>
