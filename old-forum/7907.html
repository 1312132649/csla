The framework-like thing I'd created as part of the book needed a name.</P>
<P>At the time, acronyms were "in", and so having an acronym made sense. My publisher and I went through many iterations and ideas. My only real regret is that we couldn't fit an "X" into the name... :)</P>
<P>Thus the <EM>Component-based Scalable Logical Architecture</EM> came into being.</P>
<P>Of course shifting from COM to .NET meant that the "component-based" part of the name had no real meaning. So "CSLA" switched from being an acronym to being a word.</P>
<P>This is much like "SOAP" which started out as <EM>Simple Object Access Protocol</EM> until it quit being simple, and so they decided it was now a word, not an acronym.</P>
<P>So now I have an albatross around my neck - an unsexy acronym-become-word. But reality is that changing the name would be challenging now, because (for better or worse) there's real brand equity around CSLA .NET...</P>
<P>At VS Live Orlando, Richard Hale-Shaw suggested that I reinterpret the CSLA acronym.</P>
<P>So there's the fun idea - what do <EM>you think</EM> "CSLA" should stand for? :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rasupit replied on Thursday, October 29, 2009</h2>Cal.

Labs. At a large review meeting, 50+ people, the presenter was asked what the colomn heading TLA was. One of the few times I saw them embarrassed.<br /><br />Many now will recognize TLA as Three Letter Acronymn, but that was not commonly known 20 years ago. They had used what had been an inside jest making fun of the use of acronyms without defining it.<br /><br />With that in mind, and Rocky's initial posting in mind:<br /><br />CSLA - Cause Somone Likes Acronyms.<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Wednesday, November 04, 2009</h2><P>Hi Rocky,</P>
