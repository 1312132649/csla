<P>"Attempted to read or write protected memory.&nbsp; This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt."</P>
<P>All other controls work fine.&nbsp; The application builds and runs fine.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I have done a shutdown/restart to no avail.</P>
<P>What might be causing this?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 25, 2007</h2><P>I have no idea. There's a known issue when adding a CslaDataSource through the add a datasource wizard, but there are no known issues with dragging-and-dropping a CslaDataSource off the toolbox.</P>
<P>I just tried it to be sure, but it works fine in VS 2005 and VS 2008.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
