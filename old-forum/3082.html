<P>My current train of thought is to do some sort of 3.0 ebook in the very near future, and Expert C#/VB 2008 Business Objects books after that, with a target release in the second quarter of 2008.</P>
<P>But nothing is set yet, as I'm still talking to Apress about these things, and I'm trying to see if I have time to do an ebook in the next few weeks.</P>
<P>If I do decide to do the ebook, it will probably be a little different than the last one. I'm considering focusing purely on how to <EM>use</EM> the 3.0 features, and not spending time discussing the implementation within the framework. This would reduce my time/effort, and the size/cost of the book.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, June 25, 2007</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>I agree with your idea about the ebook and focusing on how to use the new code.</P>
<P>We can always read the code to see how it works.</P>
