<p>Gets a value indicating whether an instance of the Model can currently be created.</p>
<p>I have noticed that this property will always be set to false before the model is loaded, as the SetProperties() method of ViewModelBase requires that the Model exists&nbsp;(not be null) before it will consider setting it to true.</p>
<p>I had wanted to bind the IsEnabled property of my Add button to this control, so that when a user navigates to this view, they will be able to add a new record, if they have permission.&nbsp; However, it looks like I must first load something into the model before I can get CanCreate to be true.</p>
<p>Have I missed the intent of this property, or is there an issue with the CanCreate property?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, October 28, 2010</h2><p>That sounds like a bug...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
