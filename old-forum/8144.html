I have checked the data returned from the database and it is sound and the FamilyMemberList is populated correctly.<br /><br />Javed<br /><br />AutoCompleteBox ItemsSource="{Binding Path=Member}" was clearly wrong since I need to bind to the list, which I have now done in code behind.  In Debug Watch window the ItemSource now has a list with the correct number of FamilyMember objects.  AutoCompleteBox still auto completes nothing.   How does the control know to bind to the Member Property of the object?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Friday, December 18, 2009</h2>I got it.  One has to override the ToString method in the member BusinessObject to return the property that should be displayed in the AutoCompleteBox.<br /><br />Javed</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
