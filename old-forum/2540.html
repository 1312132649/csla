<P>Can anyone show me how to code the rule and the rule args and the AddBusinessRule?</P>
<P>Or just point me at an example somewhere.&nbsp; Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, March 16, 2007</h2><P>What you are describing is not much different from the custom rule in the Project class in ProjectTracker. That method compares the start and end dates of the project - but you can use the same scheme to limit one field by the other in different ways.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>IraD replied on Friday, March 16, 2007</h2><P>Are you referring to the BrokenRules.Assert coding? I haven't used that before and will investigate it.</P>
<P>I have simplified my example and am wondering if I have created a distortion.&nbsp; The real case is that I have a complex edit to perform on FieldA but the value of FieldB must be known to perform the correct test.</P>
<P>Should I stay away from the CommonRules and CustomRules approach and instead code it in the SET for the fields?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mercule replied on Friday, March 16, 2007</h2><P>Ira,</P>
<P>The method in question is the <FONT face="Courier New" size=2>StartDateGTEndDate()</FONT> method in the Project class.</P>
<P>The example is on pp 416-417 of the C# book.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>IraD replied on Monday, March 19, 2007</h2>All is belatedly clear. Thanks to Rocky and Mercule.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
