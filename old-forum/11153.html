<p><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx</a></p>
<p>The Silverlight projects are now bound to Silverlight 5.</p>
<p>I plan to write a document describing how to undo the very few changes required to support Silverlight 5, so if you want to back-port the code for Silverlight 4 you&#39;ll be able to do so on your own. This document will be available within the next couple weeks - before the 4.3 release.</p>
<p>My plan is to release 4.3 on or before Feb 29. </p>
<p>That will allow us to branch 4.3 in svn so the primary codebase can focus on version 4.5 with support for .NET 4.5 and WinRT.</p>
<p>The 4.3 release will go into maintenance mode - meaning we&#39;ll address bugs, but don&#39;t plan any more feature changes.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jack replied on Monday, February 13, 2012</h2><p>Just a heads up that the installer is still writing to the 4.2 folder and not to a 4.3 folder.</p>
<p>Jack</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 13, 2012</h2><p>Thanks Jack - I really need to add that step to my release document so I don&#39;t forget next time...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, February 14, 2012</h2><p>For those concerned about SL4 support, I am changing my position on this and will be building 4.3 for both 4 and 5.</p>
<p>This is because of some unforeseen complexity with mixing 4 and 5 assemblies in a SL5 project, coupled with the sad reality that a numb of other common OSS components do not yet provide SL5 support.</p>
<p>In short, more people are trapped on SL4 than I would have expected, and I don&#39;t want to abandon them (you).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 15, 2012</h2><p>I have now made beta version 4.3.2 available for download.</p>
<p>This is the same code as 4.3.1, but now includes assemblies built for Silverlight 4 as well as Silverlight 5.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jack replied on Thursday, February 16, 2012</h2><p>I cannot get 4.3.x to work at all in my configuration nor can I get the ProjectTracker sample to work either.&nbsp; I am also now having issues with my standard 4.2.x build ever since I installed IIS Express after trying to open one of the samples.</p>
<p>With 4.2 I&#39;m getting huge long timeouts when accessing the WCF webapplication.</p>
<p>With 4.3 I get NotFound errors with my application and with the ProjectTracker application I get errors trying to do anything with the dataportal.&nbsp; If I do the SL version I just get an error if I do the WPF version then I at least see it is unable to create the DALManager in the last step (see below).</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting pretty confused/frustrated - any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in both I can nolonger get to <a href="http://localhost:2555/WcfPortal.svc">http://localhost:2555/WcfPortal.svc</a> I get a big config error about:</p>
<p>Metadata publishing for this service is currently disabled.</p>
<p>If you have access to the service, you can enable metadata publishing by completing the following steps to modify your web or application configuration file:</p>
<p>1. Create the following service behavior configuration, or add the &lt;serviceMetadata&gt; element to an existing service behavior configuration: </p>
<p>&lt;behaviors&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;behavior name=&quot;MyServiceTypeBehaviors&quot; &gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/behavior&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/serviceBehaviors&gt;<br />&lt;/behaviors&gt;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The ProjectTracker craps out here:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />public static IDalManager GetManager() {</p>
<p>if (_dalType == null) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var dalTypeName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&quot;DalManagerType&quot;]; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(dalTypeName)) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _dalType = Type.GetType(dalTypeName); <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw new NullReferenceException(&quot;DalManagerType&quot;); <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (_dalType == null) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw new ArgumentException(string.Format(&quot;Type {0} could not be found&quot;, dalTypeName)); <br />}<br />return (IDalManager)Activator.CreateInstance(_dalType);</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
