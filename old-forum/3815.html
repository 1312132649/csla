<P>Which leads me to REALLY want to polish the unit testing and how that should work.&nbsp; I&nbsp; read the long post from a few years on Unit Testing and that was somewhat helpful.&nbsp; Mostly it confirms that the way I have decided to do this is not all wrong.&nbsp; Namely that I have indepent test that test all the CRUD procedures against the biz objects.&nbsp; Now I would like to polish that.&nbsp; How do you setup the testing of child collections?&nbsp; Do you create a test class for each bizobject?&nbsp; Do you also test for children there or do you set up separate testing for the child objest (which first create a parent object)?&nbsp; How do you determine what data to add?&nbsp; Random or what pops into your head?&nbsp; </P>
<P>David D you mentioned that you use an abstract base class and then override for each BizObject.&nbsp; (Or perhaps another one of you)...Would you be willing to post some sample code (pehaps the abstract and one BO class) that I could look at on how to do that.&nbsp; I am still new to OO design (which is why working with CSLA has been so powerfully educational to me) and I have an idea of what it would look like but seeing it would be great and help/confirm I am going in the right direction.</P>
<P>Thanks for all you guys who helps us folks out.&nbsp; You are appreciated.</P>

<P>Whether you create the tests in a separate class or not is down to personal choice and preferred style.&nbsp; For example, our current standard is to use the name of the BO as a namespace and have classes for each of the "units" we test.&nbsp; See the ProjectTracker.Tests&nbsp;project on CodePlex for an example of what I mean.</P>
<P>What data you choose to use is again down to personal choice and style.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If the "unit" you are testing is an Add(item) method, then what data you use inside the item is mostly irrelevant.&nbsp; The real tests should be concerned with what happens if you pass a null reference versus what happens if you pass a valid object reference.</P>
<P>However, if the "unit" you are testing is a property setter then the data you choose may be critical to ensure that you get the coverage of all boundary conditions.&nbsp; By that I mean, what happens with null references, empty strings, zero or negative numbers.&nbsp; Usually, this kind of data input should trigger something to happen.</P>
<P>Before you jump into abstract test base classes I would suggest you write a bunch of unit tests first&nbsp; and see what kind&nbsp;of tests you write and how you structure them.</P>
<P>And then when you've got a few of them you might see some patterns emerging.&nbsp; This should then lend itself to a refactoring exercise to create some common reusable code.&nbsp; That might be in the form of helper methods, base classes, code generation templates, snippets, etc.</P>
<P>That way you'll end up with stuff that is right for you work and fits your style.</P>

<P>That's good advice.&nbsp; I especially like knowing that it is ok to test eht child objects in the tests for the parent.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I have already written some unit tests.&nbsp; On the whole abstraction thing I REALLY want to create as much that is reusable as possible.&nbsp; I just need to figture out how to get the object members into it since they are going to change from object to object.&nbsp; That is what is appealing about the abstraction.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Can you post an URL for the ProjectTracker.Tests...I couldn't find it on codeplex.</P>
