<P>I am building a WPF app with Csla as the app framework... and was looking&nbsp;around for&nbsp;a good way to&nbsp;incorporate MVVM into the solution.</P>
<P>In a few of the posts, I came across references to&nbsp;a CslaViewModel&lt;T&gt; class... </P>
<P>Can someone provide a pointer as to where one can find this class ?</P>
<P>Thanks in advance...</P>

<P>All my experimentation with MVVM right now is with Silverlight. Once I'm reasonably happy with how things work I'll port it to WPF. Odds are the class will work in WPF now (or will work with very minor changes), so you can certainly take it and experiment too.</P>
<P>I'm looking for feedback and thoughts on the whole idea.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
