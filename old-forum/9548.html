<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are currently porting the latest framework into a new structure so we can add modifications. This was simple to setup the CSLA.dll. We are running or i am running into an issue with the silverlight dll. I&#39;m very new to your framework and silverlight and was wondering in your framework, you have a reference to WCFPortal and was wondering how to recretae this or is there a svc file i&#39;m missing... Any help would be greatly appreciated..</p>

Then add a service reference to that service in your Silverlight project to create all the proxy objects. Then you can discard that temporary service app.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
