<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Studio 2008<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C# 2008 (C# 3.0)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.NET Framework 3.5</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SQL Server 2005&nbsp;utilizing SQL sprocs<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; SQL Server Reporting Services<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UI -&nbsp;Silverlight 2.0<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Csla 3.6 for Business Objects<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wcf for communication and data transfer (am still trying to figure if app. will be Intranet or Internet, once I decide that I will decide on TCP or Http for binding).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LINQ to SQL (L2S) or LINQ to Entity (L2E), not sure which yet.&nbsp; Have worked with L2S and really like it, but want to use the latest technology available for this app, but want it to be stable!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone has a document that they wrote for a project and it utilizes these requirements could send it to me at <A href="mailto:ksafford@guttmanoil.com">ksafford@guttmanoil.com</A>, I would be most appreciative as I would like to see the structure and framework for the document.</P>
