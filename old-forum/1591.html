<P>I'm struggling to prove that our application is not causing the client to exceed their bandwidth usage, but rather their other downloads and internet activity.&nbsp; The logs that they receive don't clearly indicate what causes the usage and I don't really want to get into packet sniffing and all that.&nbsp; Of course it could be that our application is causing them to exceed their bandwidth, and if that is the case, I would like to change it where necessary, or motivate why they need to buy more bandwidth.</P>
<P>Is it possible to measure and/or monitor the bandwidth being used, or the size of the objects sent and received when using remoting?&nbsp; I'm not sure which perfmon counters to look at to get a clear indication of how much data is received and sent when using the application over the internet.</P>
<P>Ideally,&nbsp;I would like to somehow determine and log the size of an object when the&nbsp;server&nbsp;receives an object&nbsp;and when the&nbsp;server&nbsp;sends an object.&nbsp; Where would be the best place in the framework to hook in to to add this kind of functionality.&nbsp; I'd rather not change the framework code, so if I can add that functionality to my own base class that would be ideal.&nbsp; But what event(s) would I subscribe to in my own base class?&nbsp; Has anyone done something similar?</P>
<P>Thanks in advance for any help,</P>
