I'm sure you will get several warnings about sql injection attacks.</P>
<P>As for dynamic properties, the only way I can think of doing it with an object would be to have a collection of properties.&nbsp; But that collection of properties could be done as a standard csla object and object list!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
