<p>The video series is not complete, but the first two segments are online.</p>
<p>The current $44.95 purchase price is a limited time offer - a discount from the final price (to be determined) for people willing to buy now and get the rest of the content as it is completed.</p>
<p>I expect to complete the series by the end of July, so if you want the discount please act soon.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 14, 2010</h2><p>I just put the third video segment online. </p>
<p>This new video segment walks through an edit form scenario, with a view and viewmodel that use an editable root business object as a model. This video demonstrates the use of ViewModel&lt;T&gt;, TriggerAction and the Visual Studio 2010 drag-and-drop data binding designer feature so you can see how they all work together to allow you to build a fully functional edit screen with no code-behind, and relatively little code even in the viewmodel.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ChaseC replied on Monday, July 19, 2010</h2><p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>We are converting our CSLA 2.1.4 WinForms application to a 4.0 ASP application.&nbsp; Would the videos be beneficial in our case?&nbsp; Or are they strictly relevant to WPF and Silverlight?&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 19, 2010</h2><p>This video series is very focused on Silverlight, WPF and the MVVM design pattern.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to use the <i>Core 3.8 video series</i> to get up to date on the way to use CSLA 3.8 as opposed to 2.1 (there are a lot of differences).</p>
<p>The Web Forms functionality hasn&#39;t changed since 2.1, at least not in any major way, so Chapter 20 in the <i>Expert 2008 Business Objects</i> book is a good reference for building Web Forms apps.</p>
<p>I do plan to do some videos on ASP.NET MVC yet this year, because CSLA 3.8 and CSLA 4 provide good support for MVC and that&#39;s all relatively new functionality.</p>
<p>But if I were in your position I&#39;d give very serious consideration to using Silverlight. For most Windows Forms users, it is a shock (and not a pleasant one) to switch to a web UI. It is really, really hard to get comparable interactivity in the web, and the user experience is almost always a step back. But with Silverlight the user interactivity and experience can be at least as good as Windows Forms, if not better, and for the same amount of developer effort as Windows Forms.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ChaseC replied on Monday, July 19, 2010</h2><p>Thank you.&nbsp; I will pass the recommendation along to the team.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
