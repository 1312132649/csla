One public class exposed by the SDK was the Customer class, which in turn collaborated with a CustomerContacts collection. These classes supports n-level undo + validation rules ect. by implementing the CSLA objects. In order to use this SDK, your GUI would simply reference this SDK library and the freely use the exposed classes. EASY !<br /><br />Question :<br /><br />The project that im currently working, uses SQL server as database, also contains a Customer class within its business layer. Now i would like my Customer class to collaborate with the SDK Customer class,but the SDK library must be completely invisible to my GUI.<br /><br />I need advice on how to do this. I would like to wrap the SDK Customer in some way, exposing certain properties and report back on broken business rules ect. - but it is extremely difficult to wrap. Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
