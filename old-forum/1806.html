<P>I am trying to use the local data portal and have copied the databases into App_Data.</P>
<P>The login screen comes up. I fill it in, apparently successfully, but get an error in "DataPortal.Fetch (Of PTIdentity) (New Criteria(Username,password))" fails saying it's an invalid instance. </P>
<P>The EnterpriseServicesProxy is being used and I am not sure if that is correct given that I want the local data portal. I wonder if I have my config settings right or what might be up.</P>
<P>All suggestions welcome.</P>
