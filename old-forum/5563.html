<P>User enters a value into a textbox.&nbsp; My BusinessBase object calls a method to check the value.&nbsp; If the value entered by the user does not meet certain criteria, I want to set the value back to its original value.&nbsp; All the other fields on the object need to stay at their current value.&nbsp; I only want to restore the one value that has been modified.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Is that possible?&nbsp; Thanks.</P>

<P>You'll need a BindingSourceRefresh extender control on your form if using Windows Forms because of a quirk in the binding that won't pick up changes to a property value while the binding is pulling a previous change from the control to your object. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
