<p class=MsoNormal><span>Andy was specifically asking about using “Crossbow” to mix WPF
and Windows Forms in a single app.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If you are looking at creating a WPF interface, that’s certainly
approachable. The answers to your questions though, are Yes and No. Yes you’ll
need to rewrite your GUI, and no there are not migration tools. I doubt there
will be migration tools, because the architecture of WPF is so different from
Windows Forms or Web Forms that I can’t see how you could automate the process…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Right now the best books appear to be Chris Anderson’s “Essential
Windows Presentation Foundation” and Adam Nathan’s “Windows Presentation
Foundation Unleashed”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<P>I think I saw a presentation of WindowsFormsHost to use Windows Forms controls in WPF a year ago. "Crossbow" would be the other direction, using WPF in a Windows Forms application? Thank you for this hint. I could start with upgrading selected User Controls and use them in my forms (Like Andy says). Upgrading the forms themselves would be the last step, because I inherited all my dialog forms from a extended base class.</P>
<P>At Andy: Why is WPF easier to use than Windows Forms? I saw some presentations of WPF that focused on the better layout, 3D, Vista, and user experience. But I've never thought it would be easier to use...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Massong replied on Wednesday, December 19, 2007</h2>Sorry, my misunderstanding: You mean that the&nbsp;control is not easier to build but it has got a better usability...?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>csanchez replied on Wednesday, December 19, 2007</h2>Hi:<br><br>I think is the other way around. WindowsFormsHost is for hosting a form's control in WPF. You might be reffering to a ElementHost which you use to host a WPF control in a Windows Form enviroment.<br><br>I haven't tried the last one, but the WindowsFormsHost is working great in my project.<br><br>Christian.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, December 19, 2007</h2>Well, Crossbow is mostly hidden I think.&nbsp; There's a control in the toolbox which is System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost, which acts as the host for the control.&nbsp; So far, very simple.<br><br>WPF is easier because, well, I don't need to write a ton of code to put a couple of text boxes on each ComboBoxItem.&nbsp; With WinForms, I'd probably have to code almost from scratch.&nbsp; Wpf lets controls contain other controls.. so no need to do this.<br><br>Of course not knowing much about WPF is slowing me down a bit, but that's just because I haven't learned it yet.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
