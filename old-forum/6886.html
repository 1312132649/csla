So basically, I need to know which specific child object was added/removed.<br /><br />I am overriding the OnChildChanged event on the parent, but the event args don't tell give me a reference to the item that was just added/removed. <br /><br />Before I go in an add a new event, wanted to check if this was possible with the current CSLA events.<br /><br />Thx.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, April 30, 2009</h2>The ChildChanged event has been revised substantially in 3.6, and I'm pretty sure you can get the original sender (the original child object) and the original EventArgs (PropertyChangedEventArgs or ListChangedEventArgs) in the event handler.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xAvailx replied on Friday, May 01, 2009</h2>Thx Rocky.<br /><br />Actually, I just checked and we are on 3.6.1, sorry for the confusion.<br /><br />On the parent object, this is what the ChildChangedEventArgs contains:<br /><br />ChildObject - Child Collection with current items<br />ListChangedArgs - ListChangedType, NewIndex, OldIndex<br />PropertyChangedArgs - Null<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
