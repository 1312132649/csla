<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AppIdentity.GetAppIdentity(username, password, (o, e) =&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (e.Error == null &amp;&amp; e.Object != null)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SetPrincipal(e.Object);</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Logout();</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; });</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br /><br />The problem I&#39;m having is that when i check to see if the user is logged in on the ViewModel &quot;if (Csla.ApplicationContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)&quot; the&nbsp;SetPrincipal&nbsp;method has not yet been called. &nbsp;Only once you try login again does it know you are authenticated.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, May 09, 2011</h2><p>The async nature of Silverlight makes this a little tricky. You need to rethink how your login process will work, and make the overall process async.</p>
<p>I usually have a viewmodel for my main shell window, and it has a property like ApplicationReady or&nbsp;AuthenticatedUser or something. If that value is false, the majority of the UI is blocked out by the shell (often with a Canvas overlay).</p>
<p>The login window can do the login process, but once it is complete (one way or the other), it should change the view to the welcome page or something.</p>
<p>I assume you are using some MVVM framework if you are using a viewmodel. So your MVVM framework will provide a way for a viewmodel (like the LoginViewModel) to ask the shell to display a new view.</p>
<p>Similarly, your MVVM framework probably has a messaging component, so your login viewmodel code can send a &quot;logged in&quot; or &quot;logged out&quot; message, and the main shell&#39;s viewmodel can listen for that message so it knows to update the ApplicationReady property - and that&#39;ll unlock the app through data binding.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, there are <em>many</em> variations on this theme - so I&#39;m just describing the high level concepts.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
