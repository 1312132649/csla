<P>References I am replacing are derived classes of some base class.</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sai replied on Tuesday, July 17, 2007</h2><P>UndoableBase.UndoChanges checks for DeclaringType and not ReflectedType which made me to move declaration of&nbsp;data members from base to derived class and replace property methods with abstract methods in base class.</P>
<P>Is there any workaround to avoid this?</P>

<P>N-level undo will revert your child reference to null/Nothing, but it won't revert your reference to some other child.</P>
<P>If you need that behavior, the child must be contained in a BusinessListBase collection, because BLB does include code to revert a child reference to a previous child.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
