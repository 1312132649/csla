<p>Is there a way to tell whether an object has been edited after BeginEdit() has been called? The object may already be Dirty when BeginEdit is called so I cant check that.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t seen a way to do this and&nbsp; I need to be able to enable/disable an &quot;Undo&quot; button which calls CancelEdit to roll back changes by an undo level.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>You can probably add your own implementation though, because (iirc) you can override PropertyHasChanged to add your own alternate change tracking.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
