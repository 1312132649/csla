<P>Glad to know you managed to get it working.</P>
<P>You can ignore the Interfaces folder, that has crept into the solution by mistake and was a hangover from some research work we were doing.</P>

all non-lazy class and collection mappings. </i><i>For the lazy classes to function correctly, all their public members must be 
virtual (overridable). Since this is a very significant potential source of 
errors when developing on .NET, NHibernate 1.2 will check at configuration time 
that all lazy classes fulfill the requirements. [...]<br><strong>Beware, this means you have to put lazy="false" on all collection 
mappings and classes which previously did not have a 
"lazy"-attribute.<br></strong>A quick and dirty alternative for migration is also to put 
default-lazy="false" on all your hibernate-mapping elements.<br><br></i>how did you do it? changed all the non-virtual methods in the base classes too?<i><br></i>is the support for generic collections worth this troubles?<br><br>btw: i really want to thank david for this wonderful and inspiring contribution!<br><br>harry<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Tuesday, August 28, 2007</h2><P>Just to be clear for other readers of these posts - the example code in CodePlex was written against NHibernate&nbsp;v1.0.3.</P>
<P>We have not upgraded yet to the latest v1.2 code line due to project delivery work.</P>
