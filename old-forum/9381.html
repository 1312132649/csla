<p>A profile is used in the AddBusinessRules() to decide which rules are added to the rules collection.&nbsp; The rules are added conditionally.</p>
<p>What happens is if the single object A &nbsp;is opened the static rules for that object are loaded.&nbsp; If that object is closed and a new object B&nbsp;is opened the static rules for object A are still in place.&nbsp; I&#39;m guessing that is because the rules are static and only loaded once.&nbsp; Apparently, the rules are held in memory even if the objects are all closed?&nbsp; Is that correct?</p>
<p>It looks as if the fix is to make all the conditional rules instance rules.&nbsp; Does that sound right?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Monday, August 16, 2010</h2><p>Actually, in looking over this, is there a way to clear a session so that the business rules are &quot;re added&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, when I create a new object is created AddBusinessRules is called again?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Monday, August 16, 2010</h2><p>When I open an object and its checkec by a profile the object loads up static rules and those static rules don&#39;t go away when the object is set to null.&nbsp; When a new object of the same type is opened the static rules are still there -&nbsp; I need the static rules to go away when the last instance of an object is closed.&nbsp; (I only ever have one open at a time).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
