<P>I have a question about filling an object. The object in question handles Customers and it is made up as follows:</P>
<P>Customer (EO)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CustomerContactList(ECL)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- CustomerContact(EC)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- PhoneList (ECL)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-PhoneContact(EC)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It is a bit complicated, but is required. I can load the Customer, CustomerContactList and associated CustomerContacts from one stored proc, however, I am unable to get the PhoneContacts from the sp.</P>
<P>What I do for the PhoneList is to load them individually from a separate sp as each CustomerContact is filled. The problem I have found is that because the PhoneList does not use the same connection as the rest of the fetch, I get a 'DTC is not installed on the server' error. Question is: do I need to use TransactionScope for fetch operations and is there a more logically way for producing what I am trying to do???</P>
<P>TIA</P>
