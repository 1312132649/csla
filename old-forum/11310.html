I&#39;m trying to get an automated way of showing errors on a WinForm app directly on the MainForm&#39;s StatusStrip, following the Project example. I&#39;m not able to find an example anywhere. And I cannot find example usage of What are HasBrokenRulesEventArgs, CslaActionCancelEventArgs and CslaActionEventArgs. </p>
<p>Where can I get some advice on these?</p>
<p>Thanx!</p>

<p>If you are doing something for the status bar in a UI, I would expect you&#39;ll get the best results by doing a LINQ query directly against the business object&#39;s broken rules collection.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Troncho replied on Monday, April 16, 2012</h2><p>Hi Rocky, thanks for your quick response :)</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try what you are advising me here. I&#39;v written some code to get the 1st broken rule against the Broken Rules List in order to work as an example on a particular UC managing&nbsp;editing of a BusinessBase class. Works nice. Now, my goal is to extend it directly to the Main Status Bar.</p>
<p>Never thought of using Linq against the Broken Rule list, and U R RIGHT! I&#39;ll defenitively gonna give it a try.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll tell you the results when I&#39;m done.</p>
<p>BTW, those special EventArgs classes defined in CSLA, are they ment 4 something special?</p>
<p>Thanks again Rocky :)</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>You may also look at ErrorTreeView in <a href="http://cslacontrib.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets">http://cslacontrib.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets</a>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Download the latest source code and then goto : $\Branches\2010.11.001\ErrorTreeView </p>
<p>That project is in VB but once compiled can easily be converted to C# with IlSpy 2.0 (take compiled code and save as new C# Project). <br /><a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/christophwille/archive/2012/04/15/ilspy-2-0-final.aspx">http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/christophwille/archive/2012/04/15/ilspy-2-0-final.aspx</a></p>
<p>Remember that when you have parent-child-grandchild with broken rules each object holds is own list of broken rules.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Troncho replied on Tuesday, April 17, 2012</h2><p>Thanks for your advice Jonny <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>
<p>I&#39;ll download the suggested code and convert it 2 C#.</p>
<p>CSLA is really an excelent business framework, and it gets even better the more I dig in.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try and master most of the CSLA WinForm interface during the following months and then I&#39;ll buy what you and Rocky suggest as&nbsp;2 move forward 2 CSLA 4 (reading, examples, etc.)</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>BTW, those special EventArgs classes defined in CSLA, are they ment 4 something special?</p>
<p></div></p>
<p>They are used by the custom events declared and raised by CSLA. If you handle the right events, you&#39;ll find that those EventArgs subclasses are passed to the event handler as a parameter.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Troncho replied on Tuesday, April 17, 2012</h2><p>Thanks again Rocky. I was searching the CSLA project with the Solution Navigator which didn&#39;t find any reference to those ...EventArgs. Now that you told me this, I see that the Sol.Navitagor doesn&#39;t perform a deep search. I&#39;ve done a deep search in CSLA and found what you are talking about :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
