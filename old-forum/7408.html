Is there any easy way to run the validations on a specific field  (or better yet, a specific validation rule) from inside another field's setter?<br /><br />Thanks...<br /><br />- Mike :-)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, August 05, 2009</h2><P>You can set up dependencies between properties within the business rule subsystem. This is discussed in the Expert 2008 Business Objects book, and I'm pretty sure I cover it in the CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series as well.</P>
<P>You can set up your calculation as a business rule and trigger it to be run when any of the four properties is changed.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MBonner replied on Saturday, August 08, 2009</h2>Yes, the book deals with this in Chapter 11 (pp. 339-340 for the C# edition)  and in Chapter 17 (pp. 526-527.) You probably do address that in video 5 or 6, I've only had the time to watch the first 4 so far (great series so far btw!)<br /><br />In case someone else finds this post in a search, the solution is to use the ValidationRules.AddDependentProperty method which sets up the cross property dependency.<br /><br />Thanks for the pointer!  Sorry for posting such basic questions, it's been a while since I've had the chance to use CSLA as I've been stuck doing legacy app support rather than new development for a while now.<br /><br />- Mike :-)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
