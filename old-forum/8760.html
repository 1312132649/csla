<p>The Silverlight folder contains Csla.dll and System.Windows.Interactivity.dll.&nbsp; I&#39;m assuming both of these need to be referenced by the Silverlight projects?</p>
<p>The Client folder contains Csla.dll, Csla.Windows.dll, Csla.Xaml.dll and System.Windows.Interactivty.dll.&nbsp;&nbsp;My&nbsp;assumption is Csla.Windows.dll would be a&nbsp;needed reference for Winforms projects, Csla.Xaml.dll for WPF projects and Csla.dll and System.Windows.Interactivity.dll would be references for both?</p>
<p>The Server folder contains Csla.dll, Csla.Web.dll, Csla.Web.Mvc.dll and System.Windows.Interactivity.dll.&nbsp; These look to be the assemblies for ASP and possibly web services projects?</p>
<p>Which folder&#39;s version of Csla.dll should be used for the .net business object library projects?</p>
<p>If I&#39;ve missed a relevant post somewhere I apologize.&nbsp; Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The previous prerelease was mostly focused on .NET, because SL4 was still very immature at the time - but obviously things have changed rapidly in the past couple months, and both .NET 4 and SL4 are launching the week of April 12.</p>
<p>CSLA 4 is the first time I&#39;ve included binaries in the releases. I hope to have a setup (.msi) program to distribute at least the binaries and basic source code. I have it sort of working, so we&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>In any case, the projects now build to the top-level bin folder, and into debug and release folders.</p>
<ul>
<li>bin\...\Client is the .NET client profile output - including the .NET Csla.dll</li>
<li>bin\...\Server includes the full .NET assemblies</li>
<li>bin\...\Silverlight includes the Silverlight Csla.dll</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s not how it worked in the previous prerelease, but this is what&#39;s coming next week.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
