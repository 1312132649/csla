<p>I would like to add new records by blanking the field data from the current form and allowing the user to complete the fields on the form without displaying a new form, I don&#39;t want to open a new form when adding records. </p>
<p>I&#39;m&nbsp;using a TriggerAction and calling a method on the viewmodel, within the method I call &quot;DoAddNew()&quot;, at that point I have a break point set and sure enough the model property does have a blank record.&nbsp; What I can&#39;t seem to get working or maybe don&#39;t understand how, is having the form pointed at the new record in the collectionviewsource and having the form fields cleared.</p>
<p>Could someone help me out ?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using CSLA 4.1 with VS2010, C#</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
