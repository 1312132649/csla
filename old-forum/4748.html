Is there any way around this?<br><br>Long version: I have created a test project, FilteredBindingTest, you can download it <a href="http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=10782787791777771044">here</a>. I want to be able to maintain a FilteredBindingList reference in my bound business object, but that seems to be a problem. I know FilteredBindingList isn't supposed to be serialized, so I thought I'd solve the problem by adding the [NonSerialized] attribute to the private property, but no. The problem only occurs when the property is instantiated.<br><br>If I drill down in the databinding process, I think it is the Clone() call in relation to the BeginEdit() due to the DataGridView-binding, that is the problem.<br><br>I am using CSLA 3.0.4<br><br>Any ideas?<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, April 25, 2008</h2>You also have to mark the field as NotUndoable, otherwise the n-level undo feature will attempt to serialize the object.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FrodeNilsen replied on Monday, April 28, 2008</h2>Thanks a lot, that did the trick!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
