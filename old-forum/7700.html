If not, that may be the root of your problem.</P>
<P>Use cases, or user stories, or user scenarios, are user-focused. It should be the case that the words you use to describe your objects are mostly the words used by a user to describe what they are trying to do.</P>
<P>Oh sure, later in implementation you might use somewhat more cryptic techie terms/names. But at the design stage things should be in the user-focused language.</P>
<P>In any case, your problem description is too vague for me to guess what you are trying to do. Is this like a bill of materials or something?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Kevin Fairclough replied on Tuesday, September 29, 2009</h2>It is essentially a bill of materials, yes.&nbsp; Or at least the forerunner to a BOM.<br><br>I need a hierarchy of Items but my Item object is too heavy, hence the lighter Item<b>In</b>Hierarchy (my object not user requested).<br><br>The terms derived from user (given to me) are Item, Contains(Items) &amp; Contained In(Items).<br><br>My main gripe was I need to pick Items in order to create the Contains hierarchy and this is where ItemInHierarchy came from.&nbsp; A lighter Item object that can be used to structure the items that are contained within the Item.<br><br>So do I have <br>Item.ItemContainsHierarchy.Contains.Add(itemInHierarchy)&nbsp; etc.?<br>or do I separate the hierarchies from Item object, if so how do I save then together, a command object?<br><br>Thanks for your time.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 29, 2009</h2>






 





<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I spent many years in manufacturing, which is why I thought this
sounded somewhat like a BOM :)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I agree, when building a BOM structure, typically the items in
the BOM aren&#8217;t the actual &#8220;items&#8221; or products. The use case
isn&#8217;t to edit product information, it is to establish relationships between
products.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So the BOM structure is a hierarchy of &#8220;item link&#8221;
objects that usually contain a small number of read-only properties describing
the actual item/product.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>In this case, you&#8217;ll almost certainly have some ROL
containing products so the user can pick a product to add to the BOM.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>And you&#8217;ll have the BOM itself, which is an editable root.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I think the issue here is that the user says &#8220;Item&#8221;
and that has two contextual meanings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>&#8220;Item&#8221; is something they pick to add to the
hierarchy &#8211; and what they are really describing is a ROL of ItemInfo
objects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>&#8220;Item&#8221; is also something in the hierarchy &#8211;
and what they are really describing is a BB (editable child) in the hierarchy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>You just have to tease the two concepts apart and recognize that
they aren&#8217;t the same thing within the use case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Why would you separate Item and ItemContainsBOM?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>We used the terms &#8216;product&#8217; and &#8216;part&#8217; to keep our sanity. A
product is the top level item, and parts and the items in the hierarchy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Product -&gt; ComposedOfParts -&gt; Part<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Also of course<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Part -&gt; Composed of Parts -&gt; Part<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Because this is a hierarchy with potentially many levels of
detail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Different properties and rules were involved in a Product compared
to a Part, so they (for us) were clearly different things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
