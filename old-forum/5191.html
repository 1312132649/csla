This often caused the code to be marked as unused. I was suppressing this message but it meant any properties etc only accessed by DataPortal_xxx we also marked unused.<br><br>A colleague discovered that by declaring the DataPortal_xxx to be protected the code is considered used and instead we could suppress the message warning that the method name contained an underscore.<br><br>Iain<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vdhant replied on Friday, August 22, 2008</h2>I think there are also attributes that you can add which suppress the messages. I know that this isn't all that nice but it should do the job. <br><br>I'm not sure if these are specfic to FxCop or not but this is what CSLA itself does: [System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Microsoft.Naming", "CA1707:IdentifiersShouldNotContainUnderscores", MessageId = "Member")]<br><br>Hope that helps.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
