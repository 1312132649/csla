I have a Show list button on this form that works just like the Project Show list button.  However, when I select the data from the listbox that displays the available data (after using the search/filter field) I get my Memberedit form displayed, but without any data in it.<br /><br />I have stepped through the code to the best of my ability and the correct data is being pulled from the database, but I can't work out why it is not being displayed.<br /><br />Any advice on where to look or what I could possibly have missed in my code?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, January 06, 2010</h2>Sounds like your bindings could be wrong.&nbsp; Open the output window and check for messages.&nbsp;</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Wednesday, January 06, 2010</h2>Thanks, you got it in one!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
