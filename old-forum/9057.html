<p>While working with the attached sample (I am thinking that it got attached, but I am not sure), and also with my project I have had some difficulty.&nbsp; My problem with installing the project on the &quot;staging&quot; server may also stem from the same issues.</p>
<p>The sample does not work. This is because while ViewModel is in place, the Model has not been created.&nbsp; And that is because for some strange reason I can&#39;t create my little TestObject. Go figure! (I am still working on it) </p>
<p>I am going to try and send the sample again just to make sure it&nbsp;arrives. Nope. I got an eror again.&nbsp; The zipped file is 5 MB, may be that is too big.&nbsp; Three attempts at file upload unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll appreciate any help.</p>

For a &quot;child&quot; viewmodel, I usually require that the model be passed into the viewmodel&#39;s constructor. Either way, the creation of the viewmodel ensures that it contains a model.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
