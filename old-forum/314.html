Just remember that any embedded non-vector graphics do not scale up. I've printed to that size with no problem on an Oc√© b/w large format laser as well as banners. I'm a Mac guy by definition so printing is second nature.</P>

<P>However, that PDF was created by printing to Acrobat Distiller from within VS 2005. I don't know if the resulting graphics are vector or non-vector, as that probably depends on how VS 2005 printed them and how Distilller interpreted the printing...</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
