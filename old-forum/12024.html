<p class="Default"><span lang="EN-US">My organization would like to rely on Windows authentication to secure
ours 3 tiers Silverlight applications, in order to provide some level of single
sign-on functionality across all workstations.</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span lang="EN-US">In my case, the Silverlight hosting server is part of a Windows Active Directory domain
and all users credentials and roles are managed as part of that domain. Some
ours workstations are not part of the AD but&nbsp;</span>workstations&nbsp;login access use an user account based on
the AD credentials.</p>
<p class="Default"><span lang="EN-US">So, is it possible to authenticate the users against the windows domain
(even is the workstation is not part of the domain) with 3 tiers Silverlight
application?</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span lang="EN-US">In the very good csla ebook (Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration), Rocky explains how to use Windows Authentification with silverlight application.
But, I have also read some people use the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider for
their AD authentication.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I&#39;m wondering, what is the difference between Windows Authentification method use in the csla ebook and
ActiveDirectoryMembership ? I would like also yours opinions/advises about what&#39;s techniques should be used ?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thanks in
advance for your help,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Best regards,</span></p>
