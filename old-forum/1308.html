<P>I'm sure I have a design issue, but I can't figure out the best way to accomplish without hacking things up quite a bit. Looking for advice.</P>
<P>Here's the use case. A Slot Machine Technician needs to record access information on a Slot Machine, for example, when they open it up to change the software. The Technician needs to be able to scan a barcode on the Slot Machine. When they do this, the system should display information about the Slot Machine, such as manufacturer, installed software etc.</P>
<P>The objects of interest are:<BR>SlotMachineAccessEditableRoot - has properties about why a Slot Machine was accessed<BR>SlotMachineReadOnlyChild - a property of the above object</P>
<P>In the database, there's a foreign key relationship between SlotMachineAccess.SlotMachineFK and SlotMachine.SlotMachinePK.</P>
<P>My issue is when I'm creating a new SlotMachineAccessEditableRoot. I need to have an new, empty SlotMachineReadOnlyChild just so some properties can be displayed on the form. I can't just create a ReadOnlyChild, so I've hacked it up so I could, and when the bar code number gets scanned, the system fetches a SlotMachineReadOnlyRoot, then uses that object to populate the properties of the SlotMacineReadOnlyChild.</P>
<P>While I've got something working, it feels wrong to create a read-only child, but that's what it is, at least in my mind. Any thoughts are appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR>Mike</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, September 23, 2006</h2><P>I don't see where this is a problem - other than that I'm not sure you have an actual "parent-child" relationship as much as a "using" relationship. But that's more a matter of semantics than implementation.</P>
<P>If it would make you feel better (<img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />) you could use a seperate factory object to go get&nbsp;your EditableRoot (SlotMachineER) and a ReadOnlyRoot (SlotMachineRO) in a single fetch call:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>Dim factory As MyFactory = MyFactory.GetObjects(...)<BR>Dim er As SlotMachineER = factory.ER<BR>Dim ro As SlotMachineRO&nbsp;= factory.RO</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>SlotMachineER would, of course, be savable like any normal editable root, but it wouldn't have a public Get___() method - forcing the use of the factory. The same for the read only root.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
