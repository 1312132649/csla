<P>Segment 5 of the <A href="http://store.lhotka.net/"><FONT color=#669966>CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series</FONT></A> is now available. This segment covers all the CSLA .NET object stereotypes, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Editable objects (single and list) 
<LI>Read-only objects (single and list) 
<LI>Name/value list 
<LI>Command 
<LI>Dynamic list (EditableRootListBase) 
<LI>etc</LI></UL>
<P>The focus is primarily on the business class structure and features, with some time spent discussing XAML data binding and the use of the CslaDataProvider and other UI controls.</P>
<P>This segment is 1:37 hours in length, yes, 97 minutes. The vast majority of this time is in Visual Studio, walking through code and providing information about class development that will be immediately useful to you.</P>
<P>Because segments 6 and 7 are not yet complete, I’m offering a <A href="http://store.lhotka.net/"><FONT color=#669966>pre-release purchase offer</FONT></A> of <STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=4>$50 off the regular price</FONT></STRONG> of $300. If you buy before June 20, your price is $250 for the entire video series, and you get the first five segments, over 5 hours of content, immediately!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Also, I’m looking for feedback. Most of the content in segment 5 (and in segment 6) applies to any user of CSLA .NET&nbsp;– Silverlight, WPF, ASP.NET, Windows Forms, etc. Yes, there’s some Silverlight/XAML specific data binding discussion, but most of the video is focused on business class implementation.</P>
<P>If you are <EM>not</EM> a Silverlight developer, would you be interested in purchasing these two video segments even if some of the content didn’t apply to you? Let me know what you think, thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Tuesday, June 02, 2009</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div><div><img src="http://download.lhotka.net/images/csla_light_video.png" border="0"></div><br><p>If you are <em>not</em> a Silverlight developer, would you be interested in purchasing these two video segments even if some of the content didn’t apply to you?

They are very thorough, and he goes over the details. I find them very useful, especially the N-Tier 4th video. <br /><br />Mos sample projects have a WPF project, which is not covered in the videos. Several of those I have added the WPF project to the solution and can see the code work with WPF. (It didn't work with 4c, WPF project config wasn't changed to use compression.)<br /><br />Rocky, the 3rd video Client Arch had a major cough just before the 16 min mark. Recommend a little editing, if not already changed. Otherwise, the quality has been great, which probably made that stand out more.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Michael</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 02, 2009</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>mbblum:</strong></div><div>Rocky, the 3rd video Client Arch had a major cough just before the 16 min mark.

<P>Thanks for letting me know. I let my producer know, and he's aghast at having missed that, so it should be fixed within a day or two.</P>

I not very happy with that , so I will wait for VS2010. <br>Until then I will develop only to CSLA.NET for ASP.NET. <br><br>So I am interrested in purchased a CSLA.NET for ASP.NET Videos Series, if one day this come up.<br><br>This is my feedback , from someone who is not a Silverlight developer .<br><br>NickyLarson<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
