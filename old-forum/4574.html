<P>If I use simple control without much styles or instead use a simple image in the element, then scrolling goes fine and application performance is good. </P>
<P>However, if I load the control with heavy WPF styles,then at very high resolution say (1400 * 900) systems, scrolling gets jerky and CPU usage increases.The problem exists with machines with low graphic card.</P>
<P>I studied this and found that WPF can take advantage of hardware rendering pipeline but couldn't find any working example.</P>
<P>Is there some way in WPF by which we can use heavy styled xaml controls with good performance on&nbsp; PCs with UMA graphic card?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Paul Czywczynski replied on Friday, March 28, 2008</h2><p class="MsoPlainText">Hi, this isn't the appropriate forum site for this kind

perform better on a low-end graphic cards. It is up to you to recognize the
limitations of the machine by checking the rendering tier and code your WPF
styles and animations appropriately.</p><p class="MsoPlainText">Here are a couple of good starting points:</p><p class="MsoPlainText"><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742196.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742196.aspx</a><br><o:p></o:p></p>

<P>Perhaps load up Perforator and see what kind of performance you're getting --&nbsp;maybe you can pinpoint what exactly is causing the slowdowns.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Edit:<BR>Thought about this a bit more.&nbsp; I am assuming your listbox *unstyled* works fine, but styled with a ControlTemplate it does not?&nbsp; If you didn't set it to use virtualization it will slow down to a halt because it is drawing all of the elements simultaneously, regardless of whether or not you are seeing them.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>neerajdev replied on Tuesday, April 01, 2008</h2><P>Thanks for the reply.</P>
<P>I have already lowered the Bitmap effect and applied the caching still in need more performance, can you suggest something ?</P>
<P>Can i somehow further reduce the rendering quality while doing doing some particular task?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ERodewald replied on Tuesday, April 01, 2008</h2><P>Everything you need to know about optimizing your WPF app is here: <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970683.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970683.aspx</A></P>
