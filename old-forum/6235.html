<P>I'm just looking for peoples thoughts on their use of application exception classes they may create. In particilar I'm wondering what general opinion people have for:</P>
<P>1. Do you find that you business library has relatively few 'Application Exceptions' defined and there is usually one type that is thrown and this type contains a value indicating the specific reason?</P>
<P>2. Do you find that almost all exceptions that can occur are either DataPoralExceptions or ValidationExceptions?</P>
<P>3. Do you have many exception derived classes specific to each individual area of the application?</P>
<P>I'd be interested in hearing what people have to say.</P>
<P>Regards</P>
