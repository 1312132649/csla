<P>If you want, you could create a static observer that handles these events (in your objects' DP_XYZ and OnDeserialized events you'd hook the instance events to the static observer). This static observer could then raise a global event. Make sure your EventArgs subclass includes both the original and new object references.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CSLAer replied on Saturday, November 24, 2007</h2><P>Appreciate if you can provide some simple code.
