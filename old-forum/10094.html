I&#39;ve bought the books for C# 2005 and C# 2008. I&#39;ve been a big fan of this framework, but I haven&#39;t had the chance to use it again, until now. I just got hired into a new position, and I&#39;m pushing really hard to get CSLA.NET 4+ adopted in our shop. The shop is on the VS2010 stack.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read most of the ebooks from the series that Rocky is writing. I&#39;m finishing the Data Access pdf. One thing that I haven&#39;t figured out is where do WCF fits in. I search the forums, but didn&#39;t find anything that answers my question. It looks like there are several assumptions that I&#39;m missing.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing (from the samples) that WCF is being used in the DataPortal. I would appreciate if I could get help in sorting this out.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>First, the data portal can use WCF as a network transport. Most (probably all) of my n-tier examples use WcfProxy and WcfPortal, and therefore are using WCF behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Second, you can create a WCF service interface on top of CSLA objects. Chapter 21 of the &quot;Expert 2008 Business Objects&quot; book discusses this scenario.</p>
<p>Third, you can create a &quot;1-tier app&quot; that runs on the client, with a local data portal (so the data portal runs on the client), where your data portal methods invoke remote services through WCF. This is how you create an SOA edge application.</p>
<p>And I suppose another option is that you could create a service interface with one set of CSLA objects on the server, and then also create an edge application with different CSLA objects that invoke that service. So four ways total :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hector replied on Wednesday, February 23, 2011</h2><p>Thanks!
