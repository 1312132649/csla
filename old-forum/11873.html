(Or perhaps was this somehow implemented in a more recent version of CSLA)</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of the WebServicePortal in particular. It doesn&#39;t look like it would be difficult to do. Rather than deserialize the incoming byte streams, it would just reinvoke something similar to the client WebServiceProxy with the raw byte stream and then return the response.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, March 11, 2013</h2><p>The mobile data portal has this functionality.</p>
<p>Look at Csla.Server.Hosts.Mobile.WcfPortal and MobileRequestProcessor in version 4.5, or the Silverlight equivalents in 3.8-4.3.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
