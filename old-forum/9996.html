<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you considered adding IManageProperties to CommandBase thus allowing the ObjectFactory to load a property with a private setter?</p>
<p>It would be a &#39;nice to have&#39; allowing my results property to have a private setter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implementation would be similar to ReadOnlyBase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>a) Use ReadOnlyBase as base class (like unit-of-work)</p>
<p>b) Use normal C# properties (of serializable content; public if using SL)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>agartee replied on Tuesday, October 18, 2011</h2><p>I really didn&#39;t like the idea of having the result property publicly settable. &nbsp;A ReadOnlyBase UoW-like implementation seems like a much better idea. &nbsp;I had&nbsp;apparently overlooked that sample in Rocky&#39;s book and was focused on the CommandBase UoW examples (and getting wrapped up with calling Execute() for all command-like behaviors).&nbsp; Thanks for the quick response!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
