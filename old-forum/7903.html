If they are advertised more information should be collected, would you set it up like :<br /><br />BusinessBaseList (Products)<br />BusinessBase (Product)<br />BusinessBase (AdvertisedInfo)<br /><br />or<br /><br />BUinessBaseList (Products)<br />Businessbase (Products and AdvertisedInfo)<br /><br />Thanks<br />Andy</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Swylix replied on Thursday, October 29, 2009</h2>Or, is it possible that a product viewed by customer x, customer y, needs different advertisementinfo?<br />=> then you can it apply like ProductList, Product, ProductAdvertisements.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
