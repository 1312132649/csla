<P>I would expect the checking of the checkbox, or more accurately, navigating off the check box to cause the object to become dirty.</P>
<P>I know this has been addressed before - I'm having issues finding it though.</P>
<P>Thoughts?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>esteban404 replied on Monday, May 15, 2006</h2><P>Do you have a&nbsp;visible check box bound to the IsValid property of your object on the form also? (perhaps hidden behind another control or off the form)</P>
