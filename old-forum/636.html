<P>Patrick</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, July 16, 2006</h2><P>If you have developed something that you'd like to contribute to the broader CSLA .NET community, like a code generator, templates, a data portal channel or whatever, you need to register with <A href="http://www.codeplex.com">www.codeplex.com</A> and give me your username. That's what I need to make you a developer in the project.</P>
<P>You'll also need Visual Studio Team System, or need to download the Team Explorer add-in for other versions of VS - that's what you need to interact with the source code repository. There are instructions in the other post I put here with the message from the CodePlex team.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JTWebMan replied on Wednesday, July 19, 2006</h2>I have helped out on the VB.net Codesmith templetes. Can you add me to the new Code Plex project?<br>&nbsp;<br>Username: jtwebman<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Also I have been working on some CodeSmith Templetes for using NHibernate and CSLA together. I have based them off of the eixsting VB.net Templetes. Allowing for base classes and partial classes as well as a siingle class. Could I add them once I get them up and running?<br><br>JT<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 19, 2006</h2><P>I've added you as a team member.</P>
<P>If you look at the folder structure, you'll see that there are currently two CodeSmith template sets - each with its own subfolder. You should coordinate with the creators of those efforts.</P>
<P>If you have a different set of templates please create another subfolder for that effort to avoid collision with existing efforts.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
