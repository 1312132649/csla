<p>I have a collection of parent objects that need to have a property to filter business rule validation for themselves and all children.&nbsp; There is a complex hierarchy of child, grandchild and so on&nbsp;objects.&nbsp; These children need to skip validation when the property is set on the parent most object.</p>
<p>I need some suggestions on how to get the children to alter their validation in this manner.</p>
<p>We&#39;re using CSLA 3.8</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, March 09, 2010</h2><p>I think I&#39;d look at doing a cascading call from the parent to its child objects when the property is set. This can be done using a business rule method attached to the parent property.</p>
<p>Implement internal methods (or an interface) that allows the parent to easily loop through all the child objects, calling a method so the child object can update its own status to mirror that of its parent.</p>
<p>The thing to remember is that objects shouldn&#39;t control or manipulate other objects. So if a parent would like to <i>ask</i> its child objects to not validate, that&#39;s OK - and this would do exactly that.</p>
<p>What you&#39;ll probably find helpful is that ValidationRules has a property an object can set to disable validation processing globally for that object. This feature exists to support batch loading of properties in a web or service app setting, but should work well for you in this case.</p>
<p>The business and validation rules video in the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net">Core CSLA 3.8 video series</a> covers suppressing validation in this manner.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
