<P>I have</P>
<UL>
<LI>Account : BusinessBase&lt;Account&gt;&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Accounts : BusinessListBase&lt;Accounts, Account&gt;</LI></UL>
<P>I have created a data source to Accounts, dragged it to a form as a DataGridView. Everything works fine, I can edit, delete and add new in the DataGridView.</P>
<P>But on updates, DataPortal_Update() on Account is not executed.</P>
<P>I can debug that EndEdit() is called in BusinessBase - and then I'm lost. I can't figure out why DataPortal_Update() is not updated. I don't know where to look ...</P>
<P>Anyone else had the same problem?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>I have found the description/template in the&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;e-book.</P>
<P>Is there any place / site with an overview of the different base classes and their use - besides piecing it together from the book and the 2.1 e-book?</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR>Jmmy</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
