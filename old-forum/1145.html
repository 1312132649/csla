<P>I handle the Zipcode TextChanged event where I find the row being edited to get at the address object.&nbsp; I then call:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Csla.Data.DataMapper.SetPropertyValue(ObjAddress, "zipcode", zipcode)</P>
<P>This executes the lookup code and I can see the address.city and address.state values being set correctly.&nbsp; The problem is that this change is not reflected in the GridView. I have looked and looked, but cannot find an appropriate method to trigger&nbsp;a "refresh" of the textboxes in the GridView's EditTemplate.&nbsp; I would have thought that a change in the CslaDataSource&nbsp;values would automatically&nbsp;lead to the new values being shown.</P>
<P>I would appreciate if anybody has a suggestion or two.</P>
