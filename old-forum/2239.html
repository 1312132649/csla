<P>First the advice, I am creating an winForms application that allows the users to update some of the domain tables in the application.&nbsp; I do this by displaying a read only collection of all the items in a datagridview.&nbsp; On this form the user can click an edit or add button which will display the appropriate edit window with that object.&nbsp; My question is once the user makes the changes to the object in the edit window I need to reflect these changes in the datagridview.&nbsp; I know I could simply refresh the list by pulling all the information into the database, but this seems like overkill since some of the tables will contain thousands of records and I can't see updating the list with that many records for changes in one record.&nbsp; </P>
<P>My question is should the readonly collection know how to add/update records based on its editable coutner part?&nbsp; Or should the UI be responsible for updating/adding the new record to the list?</P>
<P><BR>Next question involves code generation with partial classes.&nbsp; How are you handling compisition in your code generated classes?&nbsp; How are you handling ValidationRules that don't depend on the&nbsp; database constraints?&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Tuesday, January 30, 2007</h2>Add an update method to the read only item that takes the editable object and updates its fields.&nbsp; Then the UI can use the editable object if the user saved the changes.<br><br>public void Update(EditableObject item)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Update fields<br>}<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
