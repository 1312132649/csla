I'm using their latest trial version 3.6 with Csla 2.1.4 and data binding it the same as the .NET DataGridView.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I've got the .NET DataGridView working just fine and it really only took a few hours to get it going,&nbsp;including the&nbsp;learning curve. I love it because you don't have to write any code in the UI. With Xceed I've been trying for about a day and have been trying to trap various events just&nbsp;to get it to behave properly and just can't seem to get it to go.&nbsp;I'm having a horrible time with adding a new record, cancelling it,&nbsp;getting errors to show up, etc.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I really&nbsp;like the automatic grouping that you get in the Xceed Grid so I'd like to get it to work. Not that I'm blaming this on the grid, it seems really good, it just seems to behave differently enough from the .NET grid that you gotta do something different.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Has anyone successfully got this thing working?</FONT></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
