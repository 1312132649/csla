<P>I have a DataGridView bound to a collection. It displays a&nbsp;text column and a checkbox column.&nbsp; This binds to a string and bool property on my object. Simple stuff.</P>
<P>The problem is I have another boolean property that defines whether the checkbox should be displayed.&nbsp; What I need to do is display the check box if this property is set to true, and hide it if false, on a row by row basis.</P>
<P>Any ideas? Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2>I don't think you can't pick and choose cells to display; entire columns, yes, but not cells.&nbsp; You'd have to enable disable the cell for the row based on your other boolean property.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mark replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2><P>DataGridView has so many events - there's probably a way to do this (might involve owner-drawn cells).&nbsp; I've used the CellFormatting event in the past to customize how field values are displayed.&nbsp; Either this event or the CellPaiting event might be of use.&nbsp; If you can't find the solution, you might check out the MSDN forums as well.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pfeds replied on Thursday, June 08, 2006</h2><P>After all that, it now turns out I don't need to do what I said <img src="/emoticons/emotion-42.gif" alt="Confused [*-)]" /></P>
<P>I did come up with a couple of solutions, but neither were ideal.&nbsp; The first was to make the column read only, and use a context menu to modify the value.&nbsp; In that way I could check on the popup event whether the given row can have the boolean value edited.</P>
<P>The other way is similar by using the context menu (or a button etc).&nbsp; If I make the value a nullable bool and make the column a text column then I will either get "True", "False", or "".&nbsp; Still, a bit untidy though.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Maybe a solution would be to create a new DataGridView Column type...</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
