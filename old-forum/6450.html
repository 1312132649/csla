How can I do this? I know this is a stupid question, but I became a little dumbfounded at the moment. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Wednesday, February 18, 2009</h2><P>My suggestion is to create an internal/Friend (or public, depending on your needs) method on the UserControl that performs the insert operation.&nbsp; Then, modify your CslaDataSource Insert method to delegate to this method.&nbsp; By setting the scope as needed, you can then call the same method from outside of your UserControl.</P>
