<P>I have created a test csla objects that reference those and it works fine locally and on remote server (using remoting).</P>

<P>I am confused about the mobile objects concept.</P>
<P>As far as I understand CSLA objects (that are supposed to be send back and forth between client and server) have to be serialized and then all the objects refernced in them have to be serialized also.</P>
<P>Since custom objects are not serializable how come&nbsp;it still works?</P>
<P>Thank you in advance&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, October 11, 2007</h2>Did you really setup the DataPortal to do remoting?&nbsp; To do this, you need to setup IIS to host the application server and set some configuration file settings.&nbsp; Unless you do this,&nbsp; you're running in local mode, where everything happens on the client, so nothing is getting serialized,&nbsp; unless you're doing some N-level undo or Cloning of objects.&nbsp; Have you tried these methods?<br><br>I'm not sure what you mean that custom objects aren't serializable; anything is, as long as you mark the classes with Serializable.&nbsp; <br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>isharko replied on Thursday, October 11, 2007</h2><P>Thank you again for your response, Andy.</P>
<P>Yes, I did setup Dataportal to do remoting, used IIS&nbsp; on a different server to host the objects and set config file. Followed Rocky's instructions in the book step by step.</P>
<P>By not serializable I meant that there is no serializable&nbsp;atributes in any of our&nbsp;custom objects (we could add it if need to).</P>
<P>I didn't tried cloning or n-level undo. I have only used dataportal's fetch method to populate object's props. </P>
<P>I guess that is why it worked? When are the objects are sent across the network only when the need to update themselves?</P>
