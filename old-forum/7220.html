Why do the examples return void instead of the new object?<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />John </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 02, 2009</h2><P>The method signature is different in .NET and Silverlight.</P>
<P>In Silverlight the method is void. In .NET the method returns type object.</P>
<P>Also the implementation is different. In Silverlight the implementation is async, and in .NET the implementation is sync.</P>
<P>My guess is that you are doing Silverlight, and just need to put this code into your .client.cs file or use a compiler directive so it only compiles on the SL side.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lgroup replied on Thursday, July 02, 2009</h2>Ah ha!!  I was taking my examples from your video demo code (006) for Silverlight, but my code is not for a Silverlight app.<br /><br />Thanks Rocky!<br /><br />By they way, I think it would be great if you were to add a video or two targeted towards those of us still in the Windows/Web forms world.  The videos have been hugely beneficial!!   :-)<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 02, 2009</h2>Thank you for the feedback on the videos. Several people have told me how valuable these are, and I am seriously considering putting together videos for CSLA .NET for Windows in the very near future.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
