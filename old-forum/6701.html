<P>Anyone else have this issue or solved it.&nbsp; It seems that when I dupe any object from a previous project and change namespace and the "Database" class for example; then copy in some other BusinessBase or ReadOnlyListBase (etc).&nbsp; The '<FONT color=#ff0000>RED</FONT><FONT color=#000000>' error squiggly-line appears under the 'Database.WhatEverConnection'.&nbsp; Whenever I try to edit the line to change the connection reference, I get the 'Not Responding/Visual Studio Re-Starting' cycle.</FONT></P>
<P>Using VS2008/CSLA 3.6.1/Vista Home Prem.</P>
<P>I am almost positive it has nothing to do with CSLA, but since we are all in the CSLA 'Boat', I thought I would ask here first.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
<P>Kelly.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jkellywilkerson replied on Tuesday, March 31, 2009</h2><P>Sorry All,<BR><BR>I was a bit worried yesterday as I could not figure out what was going on.&nbsp; I had never had this issue before in my dealings with CSLA.&nbsp; Back in November, I installed DevExpress CodeRush and DevExpress Refactor! Pro for another project and left it installed when I returned to my CSLA project.&nbsp; Well it appears that the CodeRush installation was the culprit.&nbsp; Once removed, normal editor use for CSLA could continue.&nbsp; DevExpress has some really nice components, but I guess their IDE integration stuff may have a bug or two.&nbsp; They&nbsp;have&nbsp;been&nbsp;fairly responsive on other issues; I will see how responsive they are to this one.</P>
<P>Thanks and sorry again,<BR><BR>Kelly.<BR></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Tuesday, March 31, 2009</h2>Depending on the size of your project, make sure you have the latest versions of Refactor &amp; CodeRush as there have been lots of issues with performance. I had to uninstall it for several months because of crashes like this, but using the latest version it appears much more usable.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
