It appears to be like one of those crap sites that don't release you. (Try getting out of yahoo or hotmail.) I tried the delete function in the settings, and it takes you to a page not found error. Not only that, I use firefox with an ad/cookie firewall, and a filtering proxy server, and couldn't even get to the member settings by turning them off. I had to load IE as a last resort, but still their site has page not found errors.<br><br>I have page load problems with this forum and firefox. These embedded html editors don't really work correctly, I've never seen one that does. The pages often don't load all the way, and the editor won't start.<br><br><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, October 08, 2006</h2><P>This (among many others) is why I left msn for something better...</P>
<P>I don't know why you are having such bad luck with FF on this forum.&nbsp;Did you do something to earn some bad karma recently? <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></P>
<P>Seriously - I use FF all the time without issue (I actually have more trouble with IE6). Other than a couple odd formatting issues, and the fact that FF doesn't copy-paste from other Windows apps nearly as well as IE, FF is far more reliable on this forum in my experience.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, October 13, 2006</h2>Regarding FF issues,<br><br>I have some, it usually when I'm editing a post.&nbsp; Sometimes FF will freeze, the icons on the taskbar for ALL FF instances dissappear.&nbsp; Eventually it comes back, and as I get each window focus it reappears on the task bar.<br><br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
