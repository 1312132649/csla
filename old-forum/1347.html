After working with the CSLA framework, I am thinking I could implement the reports with each row of the report being a Business Object and the whole report being a Business Object Collection.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I could implement Authorization the same as normal.&nbsp; This would allow me to portability of moving the reports to web or windows forms as well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a while from moving on this idea, but has anyone done anything like this yet?&nbsp; If so, can you give me any pointers on what pitfalls to look out for?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Friday, October 06, 2006</h2><P>We stored what reports were available and the parameters they needed in 2 database tables and created&nbsp;business objects based on those so that we could tap into the security and only show the reports available to security cleared users in our UI.&nbsp; We had simple properties indicating if the report was a management report or not - we had a simple security model but there's no reason why you couldn't have a ReportRoles object.</P>
<P>The actual report data was returned as a DataSet in our application as we were stuffing this straight into Crystal Reports and then later ASP Grids.&nbsp; We didn't feel the need to convert the report data into business objects, primarily as Crystal is happier with a goold old fashioned DataSet.</P>
<P>Hope this helps.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
