Actually from the time I graduated from my university (last summer). When using this forum and particularly by the mantra of Rocky: "Behaviour instead of Data", I came to the conclusion I must have missed the point during colleges about OO / Programming. <br><br>Therefore I am looking for a book now which described the essentials of Object Orientation, in particular Rocky's Mantra. <br><br>Note that it does not need to tell what inheritance or polymorphism is, because I have figured that out long ago. <br><br>Can someone recommend me a book that addresses this issues?<br><br>Greetz,<br><br>Ruben Rorije<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 14, 2007</h2><P>"Object Thinking" by David West</P>

As a follow-up, consider Head First Design Patterns. Again, an excellent read. People should read this before the GoF Design Patterns book. One caveat: the examples are in Java. It's not difficult at all for a C# developer to interpret, though. Even if VB is your language, I still think this is a worth-while read. </P>
<P>If you haven't read any of the Head First series, you're going to be suprised - the writing style is... different. The entire format of the book is designed to helping you learn most effectively. I'm a huge fan of the series. My only critique is that they are Java-centric.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
