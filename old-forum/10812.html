<p>I have a problem with the wpf propertystatus control. The datacontext is bound with a dynamicresource. When this resource is updated the propertystatus sometimes show the wrong icon, or two icons on top of each other. E.g. the error icon instead of the warning icon or both at the same time. The csla version is 3.8.3.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to solve this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Fredrik</p>

<p>The control needs stable access to the underlying business object, because it needs to handle the object&#39;s events, and interact with the object via a direct interface.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the DynamicResource is somehow altering the underlying object and confusing the data context connection?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fsl replied on Thursday, October 27, 2011</h2><p>If I can&#39;t use a DynamicResource I have a problem with my design. What can I do Instead, update the datacontext directly on the propertystatus, whenever I need the control to interact with a new instance? Or do I have to create a new instance of the propertystatus when I have a new instance of the BO?</p>

I don&#39;t have time to look at this issue right now, but I suspect there&#39;s a way to alter PropertyStatus to work with a dynamic resource - if you can figure that out we&#39;ll apply that fix to the code.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fsl replied on Thursday, October 27, 2011</h2><p>Thank you for the quick reply! I&#39;ll take a look at the source.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
