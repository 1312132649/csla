<P><SPAN id=ctl00_ctl00_content_content_exceptionMessageLabel0>The following message may help in diagnosing the problem: </SPAN><SPAN id=ctl00_ctl00_content_content_exceptionMessageLabel1>C:\Documents and Settings\Jav\My Documents\Visual Studio 2005\Projects\csla20vb\ProjectTracker20vb\www\PTWeb\App_Code\PTMembershipProvider.vb(11): error BC30451: Name 'PTPrincipal' is not declared.</SPAN> </P>
<P>I am trying to create a custom Membership provider in my own App, and I keep getting a different version of a similar error.&nbsp; In may case the message says that it cannot load type <STRONG>MyMemberShipProvider</STRONG>. </P>
<P>That is even though I have created the MyMembershipProvider class just like the PTMemebrshipProvider and have modified the Web.Config.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is only one difference in my set up (and it may be significant): I am using a Web Application Project - which does not support App_Code folder.&nbsp; Therefore, my MyMembershipProvider class is sitting in the main website directory.&nbsp; Perhaps I should add it to one of BizObj projects.</P>

You MUST use IIS when building custom membership providers due to a (bug/feature) in the way Cassini loads (or fails to load) assemblies...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Thursday, December 14, 2006</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; My website is in IIS.&nbsp; I originally had everything set up as a standard Website.&nbsp; Only recently I created a Web Application Project and moved everything into it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If, in the Web Config, I set the type="System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider",&nbsp;I can configure everything - but then my code, ValidateUser in MyMembershipProvider class does not get executed.&nbsp; If I set it up with type=MyMembershipProvider, I get a runtime error that&nbsp;&nbsp;MyMembershipProvider cannot be found.&nbsp; I thought that the lack of an App_Code folder had something to do withit.&nbsp; But I have not added the class to one of my other librariaes and still the same error.&nbsp; </P>

<P>I have written a "custom" membership provider myself and find that remoting may throw a minor wrench into things. I find that if I run the ASP.Net web site admin tool from the remoting web site I'm able to do the configuration of users without a problem (provided I have the application name set properly). </P>
<P>If I run the tool from the Web site itself it fails when it invokes the remoting portal.</P>
