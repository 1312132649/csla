The SingleCriteria class is simply a convenient ready made object when you only have one criteria. You can still make your own criteria class with as many properties as you like just as you did in earlier versions of CSLA. If the criteria class is defined inside the BO then it needs nothing special at all. If it's defined outside the BO then I think it needs to inherit from CriteriaBase.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Saturday, November 29, 2008</h2><P>tetranz is correct. Nothing has changed in that regard.</P>
<P>I tend to define my criteria outside of the BO so I can re-use them across BOs. But with the new SingleCriteria class I could replace many of mine. (I built them in 1.1 before Generics so there were many of them for a single criteria - 1 for each type - String, Integer, Long, etc.)</P>
