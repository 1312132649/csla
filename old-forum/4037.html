<P>As per my requirment.I have created one business object class file for table Company. but now I want to execute some queries that are related to other tables also. But I don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;objeect for other class.</P>

<P>Wow.&nbsp; Not sure where to begin.&nbsp; For the most part you should be able to look at Rocky's ProjectTracker application for ideas.&nbsp; The point I try to keep in mind is to keep my object's properties&nbsp;"encapsulated".&nbsp; </P>
<P>When I need to have properties that are actually associated with another "related" object, then I make sure these properties are Read-Only within the main object (I usually include the ID key to the related object as well).&nbsp; That way when I need to change the property of the related object - I can open the related object itself to do so.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There are several different ways to get / hold the related object's ID.&nbsp; What you usually need is a "bridge" type table - one that holds the relationship between the two objects.&nbsp; Say your main object is Project and your related object is Resource (should make it easier for you to follow along within ProjectTracker).&nbsp; You will actually need to define a child object of Project -&nbsp;that being ProjectResources (this holds the values from the "bridge" table).&nbsp; This&nbsp;is actually an object in and of itself having its own properties (if nothing else it's own ID, and the IDs of the two related objects - in my case I usually have at least the date the relationship was created and who created it as well).&nbsp; This child object really is nothing other than Read-Only values for display purposes and most importantly the ID value for the related Resource objects.&nbsp; To actually see the entire related object you would select it from the ProjectResources child list, grab the ID and launch / load the main Resource object.&nbsp; More likely than not, this object would contain the child object ResourceProjects (Rocky actually calls it ResourceAssignments, but I have trouble remembering that Assignments are actually&nbsp;Projects so I prefer naming it a little different and it is all up to you anyway)&nbsp;- since now Project is a "related" object to the Resource object.</P>
<P>It is all a matter of how you design your objects.</P>
<P>Enjoy,</P>
