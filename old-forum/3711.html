										<a HREF="/members/Toloma%c3%bcs.aspx">Toloma√ºs</a> discusses how to implement an architecture based on bith Csla and NHibernate.

<P>Obviously the real proof would be to take the ProjectTracker example and re-engineer it.&nbsp; But I agree with the idea of starting on something easier to get your head round the "right" way to do it first.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skaue replied on Monday, October 15, 2007</h2>I would really like to see how and where to put in the csla bases in a mvc/mvp-world. I couldn't figure this out when I tried. But then again, I'm pretty new to .Net :-P<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
