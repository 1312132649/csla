I fixed it in 3.0 with some added features. This isn't a Parent /Child Relationship. It's more of an Extended Properties scenario, which I'll explain.</P>
<P>I have a BaseObject which inherits the BusinessBase. Object 1,2, and N inherits BaseObject. So when and if i bind my particular control with Object 1,2 or N, I can bind properties to it with ease. Now, if i call upon my database table where my extended attributes are to be stored, the table colum has to be of XML or a Name/Value column. So my question is, how is it possible to go about this architectual structure using the new csla.net 3.5? In csla 3.0 I used a GetExtendedProperties / SetExtendedProperties methods in my properties, and then used an Serializer to make them into a Name/Value Column when&nbsp;I was Fetching and Inserting/Updating my DB. This also plays an issue with the Primary Key of the objects to be able to call it from the extended objects.</P>

<P>Oh, and while I'm spilling out my brains. I better get this off my mind as well. Has any one come across Asychronous LINQ, or is that too much to ask? I really want to keep my asynchronous ado.net the way it is.. but i'll move to LINQ if it can do async. My whole site is async and i'd hate to move backwards. Ok I'm done.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>AKaplan replied on Thursday, April 03, 2008</h2><P>am i explaining this wrong or am i just crazy?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
