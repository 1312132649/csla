I got it working no problem with a Csla BO for SessionInformation.. but for some reason it keeps my page in an endless loop..<br><br>

Now I just have to figure out how to prevent it from automatically generating a new session when it times out</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
