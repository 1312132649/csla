Let me throw it around in my head and discuss with the Rockster and perhaps I can accommodate you.  Regarding your "closing" issue: I certainly can see your point if your using UserControls, and UserControls would probably be my technique as well.  I'll have to think about the best approach here, but I'll tell you what; at minimum I can throw a "close" event that you can then handle or bubble up - sound good? <br /><br />I just fixed the last issue for child object changes so it'll be out in Rocky's next build (I suspect 3.6.3).<br /><br />Please keep in mind that none of the other stuff mentioned above is making it to that build so I'll try to target the one following for some kind of solution to these problems.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Miguel</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 26, 2009</h2><P>This is where XAML is so much nicer, because the coupling between components is looser and is handled through data binding...</P>
<P>I wonder, though, if we can't take a page from XAML and apply it here - in&nbsp;a sense.</P>
<P>Perhaps it would be possible to design CslaActionExtender to be subclassed, such that someone could override the methods that enable/disable each button. That would allow them to replace the rules governing the enable/disable process?</P>
<P>I do like the Close event. I also create all my forms as UserControl objects - I can't remember that last time I created a Form that actually did anything beyond act as a container - and so totally support a solution that makes the UserControl model work well.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>PederSvaleng replied on Monday, February 22, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;m&nbsp;trying&nbsp;to use the CslaActionExtender with usercontrols that enherits from WinPart (like in the ProjectTracker). If&nbsp;I bind the close button to the Close action my entire app closes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the CslaActionExtender support this action?&nbsp;If not, is there a workaround?</p>
<p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
