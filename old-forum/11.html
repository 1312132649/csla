BindingSource... trying to understand it...</h1><span style='font-size:small'>Old forum URL: forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/11.aspx</span></p><hr><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ward0093 posted on Friday, May 05, 2006</h2><P>(This is continues from the OLD CSLA.NET Form)</P>
<P>I have a ROOT Object -&gt; Child Collection -&gt; Child Object (example: Invoice.LineItems.Item(0)); and I have three grids on my forum... Invoice Total Grid; Purchase Items (the lineItems); and Current Line Item Details.</P>
<P>I bind the Invoice Grid and the Purchase Items Grid to there respective objects... and the Current Item gets bound to the Collection Item at Index (0) (i.e. Invoice.LineItems.Item(0)).&nbsp; I do this all through BindingSource Objects and in the beginning (before any LineItems exist in the Collection).&nbsp; So this means that Invoice.LineItems.Item(0) is NOTHING.... </P>
<P>Now... if I add a new lineitem to the collection... making Invoice.LineItems.Item(0) something... will the Line Item Details Grid update automatically without having to setup the bindings again?&nbsp; Meaning... I don't change a thing after the first time i bind...???</P>

<P>CurrentLineItemBindingSource.Datasource = Invoice.LineItems.Item(0);</P>
<P>But if like you say this equals Nothing because the grid is empty then you are not actually achieving anything with that line of code.&nbsp; Off the top of my head maybe you could use either the CurrentChanged or PositionChanged events of the Line Items binding source so when the user selected a different row (or added a row) in the Line Items grid you could then rebind the Current Line Item's binding source to Item(0) or whatever they selected.&nbsp; I may be talking rubbish, it is late here after all!</P>
