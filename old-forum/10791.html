<p>I&#39;m considering a system that stores multiple types of business evaluation records. &nbsp;These records are associated with a subject (a user in this system) and an author (the authoring user).</p>
<p>This system has a concept of multiple types of roles. &nbsp;For instance, there are roles that indicate a user&#39;s level, and would allow a user to be a member of one and only one of these roles. &nbsp;There may also be predicate roles for which a user may be a member of 1 or more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When an object is requested from the system, the requesting users &quot;level&quot; role and &quot;predicate&quot; role(s) are to be compared to the subject user&#39;s roles. &nbsp;If the requesting users &quot;level&quot; is higher than the subject&#39;s and the subject and&nbsp;requester&nbsp;share at least one predicate role, then the&nbsp;requester&nbsp;may have access to the object.</p>
<p>Does this make any sense? &nbsp;Is there a design that maps well to this sort of concept? &nbsp;Certain reading for CSLA that I should target first that might help me with this design?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>StefanCop replied on Thursday, October 20, 2011</h2><p>I havn&#39;t fully understood your statements. But I recommend to read these sources:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/PermissionbasedAuthorizationVsRolebasedAuthorization.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/PermissionbasedAuthorizationVsRolebasedAuthorization.aspx</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4AuthorizationRules.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4AuthorizationRules.aspx</a> (including Source\Csla\Rules\AuthorizationRules.cs)</p>
<p>I guess, you need your specific &quot;IsInRole&quot; authorization rule. A role basically is just a string, which you can give some additional sematic, i.e. &quot;predicateA;5&quot;.</p>
<p>The authorization rules are designed to be simple and fast.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
