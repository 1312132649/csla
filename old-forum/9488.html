<p>I&#39;ve spent a few years developing with CSLA but now I need to migrate my application from csla.net 3.8 to a silverlight app using csla.net 4.0.&nbsp; What I&#39;m wondering is how applicable the Csla/Silverlight 3.8 video series will be if I&#39;m using clsa 4.0.&nbsp; I know Rocky has announced new eBooks and videos for csla 4.0 but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s able to put forward an exact release date.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been using WPF for&nbsp;a while but never silverlight so I don&#39;t know how much the clsa framework changed in regards to silverlight between 3.8 and 4.0.&nbsp; Will the 3.8 video series due or should I wait for the 4.0 videos?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 09, 2010</h2><p>If you are pretty familiar with CSLA 3.8 and the way objects are created and used (in general), you are probably best of getting the existing <i>CSLA 4 MVVM</i> video series.</p>
<p>That series assumes you know all about CSLA object creation, and focuses entirely on building XAML-based UIs with MVVM - in CSLA 4 or 3.8.</p>
<p>If you aren&#39;t comfortable with CSLA object creation, the <i>Core 3.8</i> series is still very valuable. The primary areas of change in CSLA 4 are around business and authorization rules - which does mean video 5 is out of date, and parts of video 6 are out of date. Videos 1-4 are still relevant.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have a release date for the <i>Core CSLA 4</i> video series. I can tell you that the <i>earliest</i> possible date for me to start putting out video segments is mid-October.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>davidk replied on Thursday, September 09, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Rocky.&nbsp; I&#39;ll start with the CSLA 4 MVVM series you suggest.&nbsp; I&#39;ve read several posts on CSLA and MVVM but what I had assumed is that if, for other reasons, you need MVVM this video shows you how to make it work.&nbsp; Maybe what you&#39;re saying is CSLA with MVVM is a preferred pattern when doing Silverlight/CSLA development?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
