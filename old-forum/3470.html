<P>My stored procedure is also having some complex checks and once it is verified then it will add those records.</P>
<P>Has anybody done anything like that or is there any example on how collection object is modifed to support this..</P>

<P>Currently in our BO's, all child collections simply request child object to save itself but in my case, collection will be responsible for sending all child objects together to stored proc.</P>
<P>If checks are passed in stored proc for all records then it will be added.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triplea replied on Wednesday, September 05, 2007</h2>Same technique should still do the trick for you. But you would need to replace the parent (in the example) to be your actual list (so e.g. if you have a Person with an Order list then your XML should have Orders as its parent node and Order as&nbsp;its siblings).<BR>Out of interest, is anyone using the above mentioned technique?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
