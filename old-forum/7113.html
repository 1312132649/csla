<P><U>UI stuff:</U> Yes, we had to do this because Silverlight is missing so much functionality at the UI level that it wasn't realistic to build apps using CSLA without the UI stuff.</P>
<P>I laugh to hear I should add assemblies. You can't imagine all the crap I got from people when CSLA was multiple assemblies years ago, and how much joy people expressed when I consolidated into a single assembly :)</P>
<P><U>Docs:</U> I am ever so aware of the missing XML comments. And if I had time I'd fix them all. As it is, I'm slowly adding comments as I work on the code here and there. </P>
<P>You do realize I do this for free, and I (for the most part) do this alone?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Thursday, June 18, 2009</h2><P>You do a good job and i doubt i would had done the same thing even if i had the time. I get payed to do what i'm good in, ok and do some stuff for a motorclub and my wow guild :)</P>
<P>Anyway, u really can't spit CSLA up into 2 assemblies, just to get rid of the grid reference hehe..<BR>Or isn't Silverlight version 3 not missing UI functionality?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
