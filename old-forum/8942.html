<p>CanReadProperty/CanWriteProperty/CanExecuteMethod now accept a parameter of type IPropertyInfo.</p>
<p>Would it make sense to extend the IAuthorizeReadWrite interface by providing these method overloads?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, May 17, 2010</h2><p>I thought about that, and maybe they could be overloads. But the primary consumer of IAuthorizeReadWrite is the UI, and in most cases the UI will be using the string property name because that&#39;s how data binding works.</p>
<p>However, I can see where you might create a custom UI framework that was aware of IPropertyInfo fields and would use them, so this is probably a good suggestion, thanks!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
