The line numbers are different in VB and C# so I don't know where you are looking for sure. I assume you are looking at ItemChanged?</P>
<P>Most importantly, do you have&nbsp;a concrete example of where it acts incorrectly (raises the event for the wrong item or something)?</P>
<P>It is intentional that the list doesn't re-sort when you edit the sort column value, as the result in the UI is quite jarring - the row disappears out from under the user and data binding gets quite confused about what's being edited (currency). I'd originally tried it this way, but it isn't workable due to the unpredicable results in the UI.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2>Sorry, for not being more clear.&nbsp; It is in the ItemChanged section of the C# code.&nbsp; I did not realize that it was intentional.&nbsp; I will just keep catching the ListChanged event filtering for ItemChanged and reapplying the sort in my UI code.<br><br>Cheers.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
