<P>Have you or anyone else used XAF from DevExpress with CSLA?&nbsp; There are a lot of things that make it appealing, but it does not seem to allow the use of a middle tier - looks to be strictly 2-tier.</P>
<P>Just wondering if anyone has done any "combining of technologies" along this front.</P>
<P>Thanks, Kelly.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Friday, August 01, 2008</h2><P>Kelly,</P>
<P>No I haven't.&nbsp; And actually I've moved jobs recently, to a new position where I no longer use CSLA.&nbsp; Hopefully, someone else may respond to this post and give you the answer you need though.&nbsp; There are lots of helpful people on these forums.</P>

<P>&nbsp; We are using XAF for a commercial application.&nbsp; The only drawback is the lack of tier support.&nbsp; Our smart client basically sends queries across the wire and has to get all the results back to build up the objects.&nbsp; I really really really need to figure out how to use CSLA for the remote data portal part.&nbsp; If I could have the objects built on the server and then passed back I would save countless calls across the wire.&nbsp; Have you made any progress toward this?&nbsp; Care to combine forces?</P>
