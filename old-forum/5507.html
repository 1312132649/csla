Initally, I was looking for online tutorial or blog series to learn abut CSLA.NET but there are not so many resources so I decided to buy ebook CSLA.NET 3.0 from store.lhotka.net. (no way to see the content of that book at that time.)<br /><br />When I started reading it, I found that this book is for those who are already faimiliar with CSLA or who already read Expect Business Object and CSLA 2. So, I'm very disappointed about that. <br /><br />Could you please share me if you have any recommended resource (e..g links or blog post or etc)  to learn about CSLA? <br /><br />Thanks in advance. <br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Thursday, October 02, 2008</h2><P>Yes the CSLA 3.0 eBook is a follow on and you really need the version 2.0 eBook too.&nbsp; The expert book is also worth getting and I'm sure you could pick that up pretty cheap second hand somewhere.</P>
<P>Alternatively, Rocky is working on the next book which I think is scheduled for release sometime in December.</P>
<P>HTH.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pandelaras replied on Thursday, October 02, 2008</h2>expert business objects 2005 should do the trick, until expert business objects 2008 comes out.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>reagan123 replied on Thursday, October 02, 2008</h2>I agree that the business objects book is the way to go, but the following site helped explain some of the basics to me.<br><br>It's not for clsa 3, but it may help you a bit.<br><br>http://www.csladesktopref.com/<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, October 02, 2008</h2><P>Here's a list of the book editions</P>
