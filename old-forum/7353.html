You want to make sure that when you add a Task object that you enter/check whether the 'TaskDate' is greater than or equal to the Project.StartDate.<br /><br />I know you can add dependent properties within an object; but, not sure of this use case.<br /><br />I appreciate any help or direction to examples in this matter.<br /><br />Thanks.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Wednesday, July 29, 2009</h2>chk this post<br /><br />http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/34849.aspx<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, July 29, 2009</h2><P>Well, technically you can't make them dependent properties. That only works on a given BO. A key thing to do would be to write a rule in the Parent BO which loops over all the children and compares the dates. Then if they are out of line you can say which child BO has an issue. But the single rule exists only in the parent. Be sure to re-check that rule prior to calling save. It is either re-check the one rule or try to wire up all the events from the children to run in the parent. I would rather just re-check the rule.</P>
