As well as being able to set the internal property of the class (via a public Set on the class) it has a couple of methods I can access. I have the convienience of storing the data I need in that class, but also have some related methods I can call, all from the instance of the property in the parent Business Object.<br><br>My problem is that I update the value in the class through its public Set method my parent business object does not become Dirty. However if I breakpoint and examine the property I can see it has my new value (it's data bound via a combobox and all of this is working great)<br><br>Do I need to impliment <i>INotifyChildChanged </i>in my custom class or is there something else I'm missing.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 06, 2009</h2><P>I think you just need to implement INotifyPropertyChanged so the change notifications flow up through the object graph, but I'm not entirely sure. You are exploring an area I haven't looked into in any depth.</P>
<P>SmartDate is a value type, and so isn't the same as a reference type, so you may have to dig fairly deep into the field manager implementation to see if it supports what you are trying to do.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 06, 2009</h2><P>I just took a quick glance at FieldData&lt;T&gt;, and it doesn't hook or deal with any PropertyChanged event from the value it contains.</P>
<P>You'll probably need to create your own IFieldData&lt;T&gt; object that can act as a smarter container that does hook the event - though I'm not sure the field manager listens for change events off the IFieldData objects (I don't think so) and so even that may be insufficient.</P>
<P>Your easier course of action is probably to make your object an actual child object - have it inherit from BusinessBase&lt;T&gt; so you get all the automatic hookups.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
