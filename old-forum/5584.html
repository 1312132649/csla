<P>I thought I understood, but it seems I don't: what's the difference between these two conventions?</P>

<P>But what happens if you have a need for a&nbsp;Parent BusinessBase version of Resource?&nbsp; What would that class be called since the name "Resource" is already taken by the child of Resources?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>decius replied on Tuesday, October 14, 2008</h2><P>It seems to me that this naming convention will ultimately clash like so...</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Object</STRONG> (BusinessBase Child of <STRONG>Objects</STRONG>) 
<LI><STRONG>Objects </STRONG>(BusinessListBase Root/Parent&nbsp;of <STRONG>Object</STRONG>) 
<LI><STRONG>ObjectInfo </STRONG>(ReadOnlyBase Child of <STRONG>ObjectList</STRONG>) 
<LI><STRONG>ObjectList </STRONG>(ReadOnlyListBase Root/Parent of <STRONG>ObjectInfo</STRONG>) 
<LI><STRONG>Object</STRONG>???? (BusinessBase Root, clashes with the child '<STRONG>Object' </STRONG>of <STRONG>Objects</STRONG>)</LI></UL>
<P>How are people avoiding this issue?&nbsp; At first I figured to just add an additional Get factory method to <STRONG>Object </STRONG>that goes through the DataPortal<STRONG>, </STRONG>but I think that would be unintuitive for the UI Developer.... any thoughts?</P>

<P>I like to look at the class names in the solution explorer and know what the object does. So I suffix my bo's like:</P>
<P>CustomerER - editable root</P>
<P>CustomerRORL - read only root list</P>
<P>CustomerROC - read only child</P>
<P>CustomerERL - editable root list</P>
<P>etc.</P>

<p>Out of curiosity, what convention do people use when you have the following
within the same namespace:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>ProjectInfo (read-only object)<br>
Project<strong>Info</strong>List (read-only collection of ProjectInfo)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Project (BusinessBase object)<br>
ProjectList(BusinessListBase collection of Project)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I use the above info bit in my read-only list but maybe there is a more
elegant convention...<o:p></o:p></p>
