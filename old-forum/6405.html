The GlobalTaskItemList has a factory method of GetGlobalTaskItemList(GUID UserType) to return a global list of tasks based on the user type. My question is where does the responsibility lie for converting the GlobalTaskItemList to a UserTaskItemList? Keeping in mind that UserTaskItems is quite similar to GlobalTaskItems and we also do not wish to save the UserTaskItems into the local database just yet, we only want to populate the UserTaskItemList to show the user and let them decide whether they want to call save or not. If they decide to run a task from the list it will then go and save the list to the local database for future reference.<br /><br />Thanks in Advance <br />- Paul</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, February 12, 2009</h2>Well, it goes in a new class, the GlobalTaskToUserTaskConverter.&nbsp; <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
