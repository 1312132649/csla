<P>This worked splendidly until I downloaded the WebDeployment software from <BR><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/reference/infrastructure/wdp/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/reference/infrastructure/wdp/</A><BR>and used it to compile the code and install it on my staging website.&nbsp; </P>
<P>That's when the user authentication fell apart.&nbsp; It appears that the line of code&nbsp;in Global.asax is somehow not being executed.&nbsp; The Global.asax is not one of the files that I can see&nbsp;in the compiled stuff, and copying it manually to the site does no good.&nbsp; I am assuming that the functionality of Global.asax code is probably meant to be included in&nbsp;the single compiled assembly.</P>
<P>Would appreciate some help.&nbsp; It took a while for me to understand this stuff and to finally have it working.&nbsp; I would hate to throw it all away.</P>
