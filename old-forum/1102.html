When I compile I get the following warning. </P>
<P>Warning&nbsp;1&nbsp;'MyCompany.Library.StatusCategoryList.this[int]' hides inherited member 'System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection&lt;MyCompany.Library.StatusCategory&gt;.this[int]'. Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.&nbsp;<BR></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ramesh replied on Friday, September 01, 2006</h2><P>This is because the property "this[int index]" is already implemneted in the base class of your class. Since in base class its not marked a svirtula therefore you must use new i.e. "new this[int index]" before the property if you are intentionally overriding this property. Usually you need to override this but I dont know your requirements so you need to decide on this..<BR><BR>- Ramesh</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RangerGuy replied on Friday, September 01, 2006</h2><P>Thanks for the quick reply :) Just so I understand correctly.</P>
<P>The issue is BusinessListBase doesn't declare a&nbsp;virtual (this)&nbsp; property and the generic list has a default this property which expects an indexer of type int. So in order for me to use this[int index] I need to add a virtual (this) property to business list base?</P>
<P>Is that why in project tracker. The class ResourceAssignments can use this[guid projectid] with out a warning because it expects a guid and ProjectResources has GetItem method because&nbsp;it needed an integer for an index?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, September 01, 2006</h2>Sounds like you have it correct; although you can use the new keywoard on the this[ int index ] on the subclass.&nbsp; You should avoid it if at all possible though because you're breaking OO principals.<br><br><br>The easiest way to think of it is that this[ int index ] is actually just a method like MyMethod( int index ) behind the scenes.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RangerGuy replied on Friday, September 01, 2006</h2><P>Ok so I just found a link that explains the "new" keyword it basically just tells the compiler that you intentially want to call this method instead of the one implemented in the base class.</P>
<P>What I don't understand is why using the "new" keyword on a method is breaking OOP principles.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, September 01, 2006</h2>It breaks OO principals because it allows you to change the return type or method parameters.<br><br>For example:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public class Animal {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public int Walk( int howFar ) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public class Cat : Animal {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public new void Walk( int howFar ) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>Obviously that can be a very bad thing because you can have a list of Animals, and call Walk expectinga&nbsp; return, but things bomb once Cat is encountered.<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
