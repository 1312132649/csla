<p>Specifically if I call checkrules when loading from the db and isbusy get&#39;s &quot;stuck&quot; I have to comment out each rule one by one until I find the one that is sticking.&nbsp; This is not optimal.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t find any documented way to tell *why* the object is busy and I&#39;m imagining a future scenario where my product is released and a user reports a tech support issue where a screen is just showing a busy icon and they don&#39;t know why and I can&#39;t tell them why because I have no way to automatically report what&#39;s going on specifically.</p>
<p>There is a way to check if a specific property is busy but many of my properties are associated with more than one rule and this isn&#39;t helping to automate reporting what is busy.</p>
<p>Is there some way to tell why an object is busy?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, March 15, 2012</h2><p>Yes, </p>
<p>Asyncronous rules can be a PITA. </p>
<p>No, there is no provision for a list of property and the rule that is causing the property to be busy. <br />The rule engine only maintains a list of BusyProperties - but not which rule that caused the property to become busy. </p>
<p>Added&nbsp; to the wish list. </p>
