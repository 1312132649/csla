Within my solution, I created a new class library project to store my test fixtures. I added references to CSLA, my CSLA BO library and NUnit.Framework. It follows this pattern:<br><br>Solution (Visual Studio 2003)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Website<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClassLibrary<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClassLibrary.Tests<br><br>Within ClassLibrary.Tests, I create some fixtures and tests, but when I attempted to run the tests, I get a DataPortal Exception. Oh yeah, there's no .config file for the connection string. I add App.Config and make sure that &lt;appSettings&gt; exists with the connection string.<br><br>I attempt to run the tests again and it still fails. Turns out, a class library completely ignores App.Config. In fact, it doesn't even get copied to the Debug folder. Even if I manually copy it there, it is quietly ignored.<br><br>So, how the heck do I use NUnit to run unit tests against my CSLA Business Objects? What is everyone else doing to run NUnit?<br><br>- John<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, September 14, 2006</h2>You have to tell Nunit explicity to use the configuration file.&nbsp; Here's how I do it (this a nant project)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;nunit2&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;formatter usefile="false" type="Xml" /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;test<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appconfig="${LocalSolutionBin}\${SolutionName}.Test.dll.config"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;assemblies&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;include name="${LocalSolutionBin}\${SolutionName}.Test.dll" /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/assemblies&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/test&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/nunit2&gt;<br><br>There's a command line switch, or you can specify it in the gui as well.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JHurrell replied on Thursday, September 14, 2006</h2>Since I don't use NAnt, at least not yet, I had to dig a little deeper. The UI tip helped and I figured it out. If you open an NUnit Test Project File and click Project &gt;&gt; Edit, there's an entry for Configuration File Name.

<P>Sorry to be so late to this party.</P>
<P>I usually put an NUnit project in the same Solution as the app that I'm coding.&nbsp; As an example, lets say that I call that project NUnitProject.</P>
<P>Under this project in the&nbsp; Bin/Debug folder, place a copy of the app.config file that you want NUnit to use.&nbsp; Rename this file (using my example project name above) NUnitProject.dll.config</P>
<P>NUnit will now use this file as the app.config file for the application being tested.</P>
<P>Don't forget to install NUnit as an external tool in VS.&nbsp; Makes it very easy to use NUnit from within VS.</P>
<P>Another tip.&nbsp; If you're using a local "remote" Dataportal (i.e. you're using remoting, but the app server site is on your dev machine) you can de-bug into the CSLA DataPortal code by going into the Debug menu in VS and selecting "Attach to Process".&nbsp; The process to attach to is the ASP worker process aspnet_wp.exe ( I learned this from Andy on this forum - Thanks!).</P>
<P>Finally, to debug code in your NUnit test classes, Attach to to the process called nunit_gui.exe AFTER you have started NUnit, but before you have run any tests.&nbsp; This will allow you to use de-bug breakpoints in your Nunit test methods.</P>
<P>Good luck.</P>
