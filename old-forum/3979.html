<P>I'm hoping some might be able to help me. I want to implement the rest of this class, so I understand what is happening here. I'm no web developer, but I've been asked to do a website, so I based my site on PTracker and so far it's going ok. </P>
<P>What I need to be able to do is allow valid users to download files, and admins to upload files to specific folders. And admins&nbsp;need to be able to edit any of the content.</P>
<P>Cheers</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, December 04, 2007</h2><P>Assuming you have the forms authentication working in your web site (and I imagine you do if you followed PTWeb), the easiest answer is to use directory-level authorization.</P>
<P>In ASP.NET you can create a subfolder in your virtual root. In that folder you can add a web.config file. In that file you can include the authorization elements in &lt;system.web&gt; and specify that items in the folder can only be accessed by a specific role.</P>
<P>Then put your upload.aspx page (or whatever it is called) in that subfolder, and only people in that one role will be able to access the page.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Tuesday, December 04, 2007</h2><P>Hi Rocky</P>

<P>I seem to have killed off debugging in switching from&nbsp;VS web server to IIS. Does anyone know whether there are any doc that cover this?</P>
<P>Any help would be appreciated.</P>
<P>Cheers</P>
