<P>Just a quick note of thanks for the book - I read the first framework book (and caught about 10% of what was going on) and this 2nd edition for VS 2005 is even better.&nbsp; I hope to catch a whopping 15% this time around.</P>
<P>I want to point out how valuable the very first chapter has been for me.&nbsp; It is pretty easy to get documentation on how to build X or Y - but a discussion where the author walks through the reasons for particular decisions is really the kind of stuff I need to be thinking about.&nbsp; The <EM>why</EM> is as important as the <EM>how</EM> when it comes to designing and building one's own applications.</P>
<P>The book reads like a discussion among professionals - I love the <EM>'take or leave it'</EM> approach - its like you aren't trying to sell the framework or push it onto anyone - but rather discussing it as an alternative and so everything comes across as so open handed and flexible.&nbsp; The fact you throw in alternatives and short discussions on how things could be done differently really adds to the understanding of the material.</P>
<P>I hope as you consider future editions of the book that you'll take careful notes at key decision points and include even more of the decision making process and alternatives.&nbsp; Every portion of the theory you've discussed has been great.</P>
<P>There are many programming books out there:</P>
<P>1: General application design books.</P>
<P>2: Specific "How To" technology books.</P>
<P>The Expert Business Objects book ties these two things together at what has to be the least understood part of the development process for me personally - that is, how to use the technology one knows with the design principles one knows.</P>
<P>Bravo.</P>
