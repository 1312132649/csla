<P>As a mater of fact, I am not sure about the value of using tools like NHibernate.</P>
<P>In the CSLA Book, it is trying to avoid using such tools, but in the threads you pointed out for me, there are a lot of people who are in favor of using NHibernate.</P>
<P>So I am hoping to get feedback from different users about the real added value of using NHibernate.</P>
<P>For Code Generators, the idea is clear, and I can see the benefit.</P>

<P>1. It is not very easy to learn,</P>
<P>2. Has limited support for back-end Database Connectivity,</P>
<P>3. Requires additional work to implement the ROM and then you may have to change the mapping made in your BO to meet the real world use case.</P>
<P>4. Limited support for using Stored Procedures.</P>
<P>5. You can do nearly the same with Typed Datasets,</P>
<P>6. The new LINQ feature of .NET 3.x framework I think it does the same.</P>
<P>I am not very happy with NHibernate.</P>
