It sounds like you are implementing a "display quote information" use case, and in that context the customer data <EM>is</EM> quote data.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>slipmat replied on Sunday, July 23, 2006</h2>Thank you for your input. I will take your advice.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
