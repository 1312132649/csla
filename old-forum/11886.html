But it does not add&nbsp;new row automatically to the grid. Infact it gives an error:<br />&quot;No parameterless constructor defined for this object&quot;.</p>
<p>(1) When I added a public constructor in the child class, it started working fine but I am not sure what code&nbsp;exactly should I write in the constructor without breaking the intended functionality. Is there any other workaround to achieve this functionality?</p>
<p>(2) I have already seen few posts stating that WPF grids lack some standard functionality. What are the other limitations and their workarounds?</p>
<p>(3) Is there any recommended 3rd party WPF components which work best with CSLA?</p>
<p>I am using csla 4.5 and&nbsp;currently not interested in MVVM. </p>
<p>Thanks<br />Abbas</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
