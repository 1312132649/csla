<P>I have a class Address.&nbsp; The Address&nbsp;class has&nbsp;various&nbsp;fields.&nbsp; In addition to these fields, the address class has a collection of AddressLines for customizing localisation issues. Each address line is a String.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have to cases to design this class.</P>
<P>1.</P>
<P>&nbsp;public class Address : BusinessBase&lt;Address&gt;</P>
<P>{</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private string _street;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private string _postalCode;</P>
<P>....</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; BindingList&lt;string&gt; _addressLines;</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>2.</P>
<P>public AddressLine : BusinessBase&lt;AddressLine&gt;</P>
<P>{</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;string _line;</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>public AddressLines : BusinessListBase&lt;AddressLines, AddressLine&gt;</P>
<P>{</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>public Address : BusinessBase&lt;Address&gt;</P>
<P>{</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;private string _street;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private string _postalCode;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AddressLines _addressLines;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>}</P>
<P><SPAN>How to do?
