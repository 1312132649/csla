<p>I am facing a weird problem with one of my Csla Object Lists using Csla Light. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that in the fetch method, I populate the list using a Stored Procedure, and everything works fine there. &nbsp;BUT, when it gets back to the silverlight UI, in the event handler, the data is there but empty(instances are in the list, but everything inside them is null). &nbsp;I tried to find the answer, but I must admit that I am clueless on this one.</p>
<p>The only difference between this object list and the others in my project which are working 100% fine is the number of properties, there is a lot more.</p>
<p>Thanks for answering.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 05, 2010</h2><p>Are you checking e.Error in the callback? You must always check e.Error to find out if there was an exception during the async processing. The e.Object value will be null if e.Error has a value.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>Eblanchette replied on Monday, April 05, 2010</h2><p>e.Error is null, and e.Object is not null, in fact, it contains a list of objects, but inside these objects, all properties/members are null</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, April 05, 2010</h2><p>Are you using managed fields?&nbsp; If not, are you overriding GetState and SetState (IIRC) from MobileObject?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pneurohr replied on Tuesday, May 04, 2010</h2>Did you ever find a solution to this problem.  I am having the same thing happen to me.  The objects are populated in the data portal then empty when returned to the event handler.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
