I have it working for general controls on a Windows Form, but cannot get it working with a DataGridView. I traced through the call to ResetControlAuthorization() and what I see is in the ApplyAuthorizationRules(control) method it looks&nbsp;at control.DataBindings value. Now my DataGridView is initialized with DataSource = BindingSource, and when I examine the DataGridView in the debugger I see that DataBindings.Count = 0, but the DataSource does have a Count = 2 which I assume is what my grid is using. </P>
<P>So is ReadWriteAuthorization supposed to work with a DataGridView? And if so how can it with the DataBindings empty but DataSource not empty. My grid has been working fine for all other purposes for quite some time now.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
