<P>I am sure when the lightbulb comes on I will feel like a dummy, but this is bugging me big time as to how the login validation is working.</P>
<P>Thank you,</P>

<P>In other words, if you have a Loaded event handler for your main page, does the debugger break there? If not, then you need to turn on debugging in the project's properties and (I think) in the web site properties.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CyclingFoodmanPA replied on Tuesday, January 20, 2009</h2>Hmm, how do you set up debugging correctly for Silverlight?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
