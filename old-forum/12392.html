<p>Personally I find it very confusing that DataPortal calls don&#39;t cross the dataportal??&nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have the portal say &quot;hmmm I know I am on the client...let me cross over unless the person specifically says no do it locally&quot;.&nbsp; Not sure if it is related but there was a RunLocal attribute that handled that.</p>
<p>Getting way to complex for me to track let alone those I am going to be training.&nbsp; Conversation goes like this: </p>
<p>Me - &quot;Because this is a child dataportal call you DON&#39;T cross the dataportal so you have to use a ReadOnly or a CommandObject like a creator to ACTUALLY cross the dataportal.&nbsp; THEN you call the child dataportal method.&nbsp; The child dataportal methods just stay on whichever side they are called&quot;</p>
<p>Them - &quot;But it says DataPortal.ChildCreate.&nbsp; Why doesn&#39;t it use the dataportal?&quot;</p>
<p>Me - &quot;I know but it&#39;s not actually using the portal part of the portal...its setting MarkAsChild for you automatically and other stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>Them - &lt;blank stare&gt; &quot;This is confusing&quot;</p>
<p>Sorry, maybe just showing my ignorance and theirs at the same time by raising this question :-)</p>

<p>My option is to code a normal DataPortal_Fetch etc. on the child object and then:</p>
<p>- markaschild()&nbsp; do i do this on return or before that while it is in its dataportal method?</p>
<p>- anything else?</p>
<p>Mostly this will be for Creates and Fetches especially for lazy loading.</p>
<p>I just can&#39;t get over creating a creator for every child object.&nbsp; I know I know</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, February 23, 2014</h2><p>I really the &quot;Using CSLA 4&quot; ebooks.

<p>Your scenario is typical for &quot;lazy loaded&quot; objects or objects that need to get to the server for initialization.</p>
<p>In these circumstances you must use the DataPortal.Fetch or Create to pass tiers and call MarkAsChild on the object.&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
