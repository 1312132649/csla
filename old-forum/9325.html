<p>DataPortal.Fetch failed (A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 26 - Error Locating Server/Instance Specified))</p>
<p>I&#39;m using identical connect strings in both the 2.1.4 and 4.0.0.x project config.&nbsp; Are there other changes that need to be made in the app.config to allow connections (see attached 4.0.0 app.config)?&nbsp; The <span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#0000ff;font-size:x-small;">CslaDataPortalProxy </span>key does not exist in the 2.1.4 app.conif file and I don&#39;t know enough yet how this is used.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, August 06, 2010</h2><p>CslaDataPortalProxy is used to configure the data portal to use a remote server. If that key is setting the value to something other than &quot;Local&quot; then the connection string you care about is in the remote server&#39;s web.config file. Odds are good that you need the WcfHost or WcfPortal project (whatever I called it), as that&#39;s the process that is really talking to the database.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
