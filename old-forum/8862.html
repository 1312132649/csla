<p>Public Class MustInherit MyBaseForm(Of T as BusinessBase(Of T))<br />...<br />&#39;It can contain things such as:<br />&#39;Public Property DataSource As T<br />&#39;Public MustOverride Function DoSomething()<br /><br />&#39;You can also have all your security handled here, or the common save procedures<br />&#39;or whatever you think you can reuse....<br />...<br />End Class</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking this maybe a good start but not sure where to go with it.&nbsp; Does anyone have any code they would like to share or possibly point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

There are some hacks and workarounds, but it is not a core scenario that is supported by Microsoft.</p>
<p>There are several interfaces in CSLA 3.8+ (maybe as early as 3.6) that should allow you to create a base form that is non-generic, and which uses things like ISavable, ISupportUndo&nbsp;and ITrackStatus to interact with business objects regardless of their specific type.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, May 02, 2010</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Take a look at the CslaActionExtender that show one way of isolating generic Save/AddNew/Cancel using the Csla Interfaces.<br />And if it doesn&#39;t suit your needs then make a copy and modify it....</p>
