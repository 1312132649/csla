<p>I got this to work first using the VS2008 Web Server, then through some struggle, I got it to work in VS2008 using the local IIS Web Server as the configuration for the Web project.&nbsp; Then I got it to work as a deployment service using IIS just on my development pc.</p>
<p>I am now trying to get multiple clients to hit the Broker Service.&nbsp; The first time I call it on IE it comes up pretty fast.&nbsp; But the second time I bring up the web page - a silverlight project really - I get the page but since my calls to the Broker are asynchronous I have to wait for the reply to show the data.&nbsp; It seems to be taking a really long time to get replies for the second client.&nbsp; I don&#39;t understand why, one instance of the web app running is fast and the second one is consistently slow.&nbsp; I am not sure what to look at.&nbsp; Can anyone explain?&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it could also be that the application server is just being slow on responding.&nbsp; But once it responds to the login then all the other messages are pretty fast.&nbsp; Can someone help me understand what is going on?</p>
<p>I am using a csla dataportal between the client and the broker.&nbsp; But I think it is solid.&nbsp; I think it could be a configuration issue but not sure where.</p>
