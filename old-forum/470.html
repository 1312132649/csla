<P>I have written an application using CSLA v2.0.1, the project has a reference to the CSLA.dll wich is at a central location (for all my projects). Today I downloaded v2.0.2 and compiled it and replaced the 201 version with 202. <BR>After loading my project I and select CSLA.dll I see that the version number is 2.0.2.0, however when I start my application I get the following exception :</P>
<P>An unhandled exception of type 'System.IO.FileLoadException' occurred in SecurityMaint.exe</P>
<P><FONT color=#000080>Additional information: Could not load file or assembly 'Csla, Version=2.0.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=93be5fdc093e4c30' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)</FONT></P>
<P>It turns out that the .vbproj file in my project holds a reference (Specific Version = False) to csla.dll including the version number wich is not automatically upgraded :<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Reference Include="Csla, Version=2.0.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=93be5fdc093e4c30, processorArchitecture=MSIL"&gt;<BR><BR>I can solve this problem by removing the reference and recreating it but that's rather time-consuming, I've also tried refresh and clean on my project.<BR><BR>Am I missing something here, I've done this in VS2003 many times with no problems at all.</P>

<P>I've tried that, Build - Clean Solution then Build - Rebuild Solution, but I still got the same exception.<BR>As it turns out I was using a selfmade lookup-component wich wasn't recompiled using csla 2.0.2 so was still using 2.0.1, after rebuilding that component with 2.0.2, my project worked just fine.</P>
