<p>The last requirement won&#39;t work since it seems to be the other way around. If an user is denied a read or write under an specific role he won&#39;t ever be able to read or write it even if he is allowed under another role.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been debugging into code and bumped into the code in Csla.Security.RolesForProperty which uses IsInRole internaly, i won&#39;t adjust that ofcourse.<br /><br /><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:x-small;"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:x-small;">public</span></span><span style="font-size:x-small;"> </span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:x-small;"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:x-small;">bool</span></span><span style="font-size:x-small;"> IsWriteDenied(</span><span style="color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;">IPrincipal</span></span><span style="font-size:x-small;"> principal)<br />{<br /></span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:x-small;"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:x-small;">&nbsp;&nbsp; return</span></span><span style="font-size:x-small;"> </span><span style="color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;">AuthorizationRulesManager</span></span><span style="font-size:x-small;">.PrincipalRoleInList(principal, WriteDenied);<br />}</span></p>
<p>Does anyone understand my problem?<br />Do u know a way to turn the behaviour the other way using the deny rules? Or any suggestions?<br /><br />I think i&#39;ll have to add a deny rule only if the rule applies in both authorizationgroups.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Monday, June 14, 2010</h2><p>Oh well..</p>
<p>I solved it by adding allow rules&nbsp;whenever i have one deny rule i just add all allow rules excluding the deny rule.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, June 15, 2010</h2><p>You should only need the Allow setups.&nbsp; Csla works by granting access to all by default.&nbsp; If you specify allow or deny, then the roles are checked.&nbsp; If you specify Allow, then any roles not in the list will be denied by default.&nbsp; An explicity Deny would however override an Allow.</p>
<p>In other words, the Deny rule is redunant; just call Allow for your administrator, and all users not in Administrator would be denyed by default.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Wednesday, June 16, 2010</h2><p>yup, exactly the way i solved it</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
