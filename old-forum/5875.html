<p class=MsoNormal><span>Indeed, you discovered an SL bug.&nbsp; One character change is
not pushed by binding infrastructure to underlying object.&nbsp; At least two
character change is required.&nbsp; I think this has been logged in
Silverlight.net, but I am not 100% positive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hi <br>
<br>
I first noticed this in a CSLA Silverlight app I have been experimenting with
and have just downloaded the lastest Rolodex sample and get the same behaviour.<br>
<br>
If for instance I edit the AT&amp;T company record by adding an extra character
at the end of the company name textbox I sometimes find that the save button is
not enabled when I tab off the textbox control. Even if I shift tab back or
change the focused control using the mouse nothing happens until I enter
another character. <br>
<br>
On a CSLA Silverlight app that I have been experimenting with I can enter a
single character into a sequence of textboxes after tabbing between each of
them and get the same behaviour. I added some code and discovered that the text
changed event is being invoked but none of the csla silverlight code is run. <br>
<br>
Also if I do enter more than one character into a textbox and then click save
the previous textboxes which did not cause a change in the save button lose
their change.<br>
<br>
Is this possibly a silverlight bug?<br>
<br>
Regards<br>
DTS<br>
