<P>How in the world do we leverage what we have in CSLA to work in the provider state?</P>
<P>I've done some searching but nothing really hits it from this angle and trying to reverse the logic hasn't gone very well.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ronnymgm replied on Wednesday, August 24, 2011</h2><p><br />I know this post is a little bit old but I want to know how you solve this problem...</p>
<p>The same problem: We are integrating our e-Commerce (that uses CSLA IPrincipal) within sitefinity CMS and it use its own security principal.</p>
<p>Looks like you can&#39;t have both working together because each one rely on its own custom principal implementation.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help..comment.. or tip..</p>
