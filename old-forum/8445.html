<P>This is a bug-fix release, and has been in beta for several months. </P>
<P>There is only one real functional (and breaking) change, which affects only people building WPF or Silverlight applications and using the design-time data support built into the data portal. This feature has been disabled in 3.8.2 because thereâ€™s an issue in WPF (and possibly Silverlight) where detecting design time vs runtime in a high volume runtime scenario would cause a Win32 exception in the .NET runtime.</P>
<P>Since Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0 have a different way of handling design time data, this was going to change anyway; but making this change now helps avoid this WPF runtime issue, and so was important.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
