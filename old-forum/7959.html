Some of what I've done is experimental, and so may or may not stay as I have it - but all the primary versions of CSLA and their sample apps are now under /core/trunk.</P>
<P>The thing is, in 4.0 there'll be at least 3 "flavors" of CSLA .NET:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Core/server - the full framework you know today</LI>
<LI>Client - a subset of the framework built for the 4.0 client profile</LI>
<LI>Silverlight - a subset of the framework build for Silverlight 3 (eventually 4 of course)</LI></UL>
<P>Client and Silverlight link most/all of their files from Core/server.</P>
<P>My current plan is to only do a single release, unlike today where I release Windows and Silverlight separately. I think that's artificial&nbsp;- and will become sillier as time goes on. At the very least almost everyone will need Core and Client, but I think a lot of people (most?) will need Silverlight too.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
