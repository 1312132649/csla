What I did was add two methods in my ReadOnlyListBase&lt;T&gt; class AddItem(T item) and RemoveItem(T item) in those methods you unlock the list, add/remove the item and then lock the list. <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>griff replied on Thursday, June 11, 2009</h2>thanks, did the following

    Public Overloads Sub AddItem(ByVal info As JobLinesNotInvoicedInfo)
        Me.RaiseListChangedEvents = False
        IsReadOnly = False
        Add(info)
        IsReadOnly = True
        Me.RaiseListChangedEvents = True
    End Sub

    Public Overloads Sub RemoveItem(ByVal info As JobLinesNotInvoicedInfo)
        Me.RaiseListChangedEvents = False
        IsReadOnly = False
        Remove(info)
        IsReadOnly = True
        Me.RaiseListChangedEvents = True
    End Sub</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
