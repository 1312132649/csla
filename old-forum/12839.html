<p>Any update about my order ?? really its took a lot of time and i need it. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Threadware replied on Thursday, April 30, 2015</h2><p>I ordered the overview ebook in early march and did got a resolution from&nbsp;<span>cslastore &nbsp;@ &nbsp;lhotka.net in late March. &nbsp;I have now ordered the Building Business Objects book on Monday of this week and the download link does not work. &nbsp;I have emailed all of the contacts that I&#39;ve had from the first issue/resolution and have not heard back. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Hopefully all is well with Rocky and whoever is helping him with his site and this will be an opportunity to fix the automated system and enlist some backup support when that breaks down. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Brian</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Threadware replied on Thursday, April 30, 2015</h2><p>I also had the same difficulties. &nbsp;I ordered the Overview book around the first of March and after trying a few of the contact methods on the site I got a reply from&nbsp;<span>cslastore at lhotka.net near the end of March and I could log into my account at the download site and download that book. &nbsp;On this past Monday I ordered the Building Business Objects book and started similar difficulties. &nbsp;I can log into my account but the download link for the new book I ordered takes me back to the login page. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Regarding the new book order, I have emailed each of the addresses that I did for the previously resolved order but have not received any feedback other that what looks to be automated system replies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully Rocky is doing well and whoever assists/supports him and his store site can figure out the store/downloads issue soon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I used the framework on a couple of projects over 5 years ago and a new client/project looks like a good fit for it now. &nbsp;I talked the team lead into letting me do a limited test project to demo this coming Monday and it looks like I&#39;m on my own and working all weekend to make this happen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Brian</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Threadware replied on Thursday, April 30, 2015</h2><p>Sorry for the &quot;duplicate&quot; response. &nbsp;First time using the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Threadware replied on Friday, May 01, 2015</h2><p>My download has been resolved. &nbsp;I emailed again this morning (as I had earlier this week) and received a message from Tim from the cslastore email address. &nbsp;I then checked the download site and I could download the book. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;ll provide some further details in case they will help anyone who has difficulties getting their ordered products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I also received a message referring me to the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="CSLA Store FAQ page" href="http://lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/StoreFaq.ashx">CSLA Store FAQ page</a>. &nbsp;I had already read this page including the section titled &quot;Email communications&quot;. &nbsp;There is a section there that explains that two or more emails would come my way. &nbsp;I did receive two, one from PayPal and one automated from the cslastore address so the note in this sections about misspelled email address would not seem to apply to me. &nbsp;From the comments at the bottom of the section, I take it this has been an issue for longer than the age of this thread. &nbsp;When I got the email from Tim, about an hour ago, it was preceded by a message that said I was added to a role for the book I ordered. &nbsp;I did not receive this with the first book I ordered a month ago so I think that this is more related to the current delays. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My impression is there there are some manual steps that cslastore takes to process an order and that Rocky&#39;s current surgery recovery is slowing this process. &nbsp;It sounds like Tim is helping out now so I hope the other buyers on the thread will be fulfilled soon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Brian</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Yazan replied on Sunday, May 03, 2015</h2><p>Regarding my case<b> i didn&#39;t received any emai</b>l yet, and still waiting.<br /><br />a quick response is highly appreciated.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Yazan replied on Wednesday, May 13, 2015</h2><p>Just I want to check what happened with my order, please let me now if you have any problem with my payment or any issue that&#39;s causing this lateness. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Threadware replied on Thursday, May 14, 2015</h2><p>Just to let you know, I think the delay was due to the particular timing of your order and mine. &nbsp;Rocky had gone to hospital for major surgery and is still in recovery. &nbsp;I only know this because I received an email and it appeared to be from him. &nbsp;I ordered a second book and had another small delay that was resolved again by emailing the cslastore address I indicated above. &nbsp;I ordered a third book and got access to it overnight, which is apparently the intended process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what else to tell you. &nbsp;I sent a link to this forum thread when I first received contact and access to my first book. &nbsp;I believe in my case that the initial issue was access to the downloads site would not work. &nbsp;My second book order took several days for the download link to work from the download site and the next two were accessible the next day. &nbsp;You have to make sure you are not losing their mail to a spam engine or other blocking. &nbsp;Comments on their FAQ site seem to indicate they have had many complaints that were results of emails being blocked. &nbsp;Beyond that, keep trying the cslastore address. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know if you have ordered one book or the set but now that they are responding perhaps a second order would also jar the download site administrator into setting your download access properly. &nbsp;I know, that is a bad solution and should not be necessary but I&#39;m just sharing all thoughts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I&#39;ve ordered twice this week and gotten access to both (and emails indicating so) I think the csla book operation is functioning properly now. &nbsp;It sounds to me like they have not gone back and fully caught up on orders from the transition in Rocky&#39;s absence. &nbsp;Good luck.</p>
<p>Brian</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 20, 2015</h2><p>Yes Brian, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve been out for a few months due to my surgery. I&#39;m easing back into some work now, which is really nice, but recovery is slow.</p>
<p>I am very sorry for any trouble people had during this time with store orders.</p>
<p>Generally emailing <a href="mailto:cslastore@lhotka.net">cslastore@lhotka.net</a> is the correct way to get support. Tim is usually able to resolve issues, but occasionally something happens where he can&#39;t figure things out, and that has caused some delays.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, literally two days before my surgery something happened to the email server the store relies on, so there was a period where emails were working sporadically at best. Timing couldn&#39;t have been worse, as my primary focus at that time (and this sounds morbid) was ensuring everything was in order for my family in case the surgery was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I think the email server is working properly now.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, I&#39;m working on setting up a whole new store with different software, because what I&#39;ve got now has become far too problematic.</p>
<p>Again, I am sorry for any trouble people have had.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
