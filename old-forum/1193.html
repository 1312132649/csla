<P>Why does ReadOnlyBase have functions defined for Update, Delete, and Create.&nbsp; Even if all they do is throw exceptions, why have them at all in a read only class?&nbsp; I thought that it might be to implement an some DataPortal interface, but I can comment out any or all of these functions and the compiler doesn't complain.</P>
<P>Just curious.</P>

Data portal would throw a method not found exception if they were removed and someone decided to try and call DataPortal.Update() on a ROB-derived object.</P>
<P>The reason they are there is to offer a nicer (?) exception message than method not found. Not all that important really, but having them in the code doesn't harm anything either, so I thought it was a decent trade-off.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
