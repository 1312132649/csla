<P>You can declare private properties with managed backing fields, and perhaps that can help? Declare a private property to manage the lists, and expose them in a separate public property?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, March 02, 2009</h2>Yes, I am, but it does seem to work pretty nicely. <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />&nbsp; I may give that a shot.&nbsp; I think at this point I'm leaning to leaving LineItem children as unmanaged;&nbsp; it should still be able to contain other managed properties, but this part took a while to get working so maybe I should just leave well enough alone.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
