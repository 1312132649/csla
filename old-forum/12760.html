<p>hello Rocky.. </p>
<p>The last version of CSLA I used is 4.3.12</p>
<p>If I have a plan to learn to write android or ios use xamarin for my CSLA.</p>
<p>my questions are :</p>
<p>1. which version I have to used ?</p>
<p>2. what xamarin tools I have to used ? xamarin studio or xamarin for visual studio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks a lot &amp; God Bless...</p>

<p>Current Xamarin Studio supports NuGet, as does Visual Studio of course, so you should be able to get the latest CSLA framework via NuGet from either development tool.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Monday, September 29, 2014</h2><p>To mildly hijack a thread as the blog post has its comments closed...</p>
<p>...when you demonstrate CSLA with Xamarin in Orlando, will you be using Xamarin.Forms, or do you still consider that to be too immature?</p>
<p>The Xamarin route is really appealing when it&#39;s not about having to write separate native UIs, and potentially be coding in a &quot;meta-data&quot; type way where potentially future UIs might automatically get supported rather than having to code up another native UI.</p>
<p>Just wondering if things have evolved further with CSLA working with Xamarin (especially Xamarin.Forms).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, September 29, 2014</h2><p>I am doing a pre-con workshop in Orlando (Visual Studio Live! conference) that will include some time with CSLA in Windows and Xamarin. The workshop as a whole will cover Xamarin with and without xForms, MVVM, CSLA, and some other topics.</p>
<p>CSLA does work with Xamarin.Forms now. I haven&#39;t invested time in building xForms UI widgets just yet because I&#39;m not confident that they won&#39;t change the platform as they make it more mature.</p>
<p>My view on this in terms of recommendations to <a href="http://www.magenic.com">Magenic </a>customers is that Xamarin.Forms is still a little too immature unless the customer wants to accept that risk. For customers who are risk-averse then using native iOS/Android interface technologies in Xamarin is the better way to go.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, September 29, 2014</h2><p>fyi, next week at <a href="http://www.vslive.com">Visual Studio Live!</a> in Washington DC I also have a 75 minute talk on building cross platform business apps with Xamarin and CSLA, so I&#39;ll be using CSLA for Xamarin then as well.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Monday, September 29, 2014</h2><p>Thanks very much for your replies today - I truly look forward to hearing more about your impression of using CSLA with Xamarin.Forms over time as it hopefully matures.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Thursday, November 13, 2014</h2><p>I&#39;d be fascinated to hear that talk, I don&#39;t suppose there&#39;s a video anywhere? &nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, December 15, 2014</h2><p>No video, you have to attend the next <a href="http://www.vslive.com">Visual Studio&nbsp;Live</a> or <a href="http://www.modernappslive.com">Modern Apps Live</a> conference :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>st3fanus replied on Tuesday, September 30, 2014</h2><p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>It&#39;s mean that Business Layer / Business Object dll I develop and build and visual studio could be read / open / load on xamarin studio for creating android client app ? Or I have to use visual studio ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p>
