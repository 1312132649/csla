I want to find some sample projects to get familiarly how to use CSLA.NET in my project. In addition, when I searched in search engine I accidenttally see one sample project that convert Northwind application to CSLA.NET project, but I don't know url to download it. I hope to get your recommended url to get started.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Samnang<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triplea replied on Wednesday, August 22, 2007</h2>Isn't the project tracker sample good enough? And I believe the Northwind sample you mention is used in the Csla Contrib project in Codeplex (search CSLA in <A href="http://www.codeplex.com">www.codeplex.com</A> and you'll find it). Rocky has got some other samples in his downlaod section (e.g. the deep dat sample).</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
