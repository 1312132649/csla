You are all life savers!</P>
<P>I am just looking through the generated code for a test class using the VB template for EditableRoot and have noticed a slight peculiarity which might be a bug with the template. It is in an area that is new in 2.1 and relates to AddInstanceBusinessRules. I don't yet have the 2.1 e-book (I'm still trying to determine how to get the company to pay for it - no, it isn't easy!) so I can't check the detail there.</P>
<P>In the generated sub, there is a call to MyBase.AddBusinessRules(). Should this instead be MyBase.AddInstanceBusinessRules()?</P>
<P>I'd appreciate the input of anyone that has more experience of this newer area.</P>
<P>Many Thanks.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
