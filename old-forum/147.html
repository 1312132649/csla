<P>Several people have proposed replacing General Discussion with separate groups for version 1.x and 2.x.</P>
<P>At least the same number of people think that it is best to keep the discussions all in a single group, because there's often quite a lot of overlap between them.</P>
<P>My fear is that important discussions, like ones around OO design or data access issues, will end up in a version-specific forum, when those are universal issues that have little or nothing to do with "version 1" or "version 2".</P>
<P>Which means at least 3 forums - General, V1 and V2. But more importantly, it means people having the discipline to only put version-specific technical threads in V1/V2 - and I very much doubt that would happen.</P>
<P>It is also the case that I have a limited number of email addresses and so breaking into too many forums means some won't have email (like this admin one), and will be web-only.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RickMartinez replied on Thursday, May 25, 2006</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I think there could be a middle ground here... </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Verdana>Just back from a weeks vacation so I'm a bit jet lagged but I think that we should avoid fragmenting the site at all costs as it'll make the material very hard to find.&nbsp; If there are issues that ONLY occur in one of the versions we should <U>state that clearly</U> in our subject but I agree with Rocky that the OO issues, for example, apply to both versions and so you could end up with three top level forums straight away.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>From there it's a slippery slope to numerous categories such as "Newbies", "Tutorials" , "Web Services with CSLA", "Windows with CSLA" etc etc.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>So lets leave it well alone I think ....<img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></FONT></P>
