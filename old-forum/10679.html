<p>I created another viewmodel and view with just that BLB object, without a parent, and the allow edit property returns correctly.</p>
<p>I have two questions.&nbsp; First, is the BB parent object&nbsp; modifying its child BLB objects allow edit property or do I likely have something wrong with my objects?&nbsp; And second, is there a way, and should i, add a ViewModel property to my View Model to which the BLB can bind and then have access to CanSave, etc.?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
