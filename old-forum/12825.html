<p>The login process is querying the&nbsp;aspnet-MvcUI-20131107034738.AspNetUsers table which is empty.</p>

There are so many variations on the versions and ways people configure SQL Server that just getting the apps to work requires that you understand your database version/edition/configuration and adapt to whatever you have in your environment.</p>
<p>It used to be so simple, but over the years Microsoft has added a lot of complexity to the whole environment around data - I guess this ensures that SQL Server experts have good job security :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
