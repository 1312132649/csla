I've implemented it with two columns, 1 combo box and 1 textbox. <br />When I selected an item from the combo box nothing happens, but on pressing enter after entering data in the textbox the item attempts to save.<br />Is there anyway I can get it to save when an item is selected from the combo box?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 04, 2010</h2><P>Watch the <EM>business object types</EM> video and look at the sample code for that video. The standard SL combobox doesn't actually do what we all want it to do in terms of binding with a selected item. The demo code includes&nbsp;code for a&nbsp;combobox control that does work correctly with data binding.</P>
<P>I think the SL4 combobox finally does work with data binding the way you'd expect, so that's something to look forward to in the near future :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Gareth replied on Monday, January 04, 2010</h2>Thanks Rocky, I've watched that video again to make sure I wasn't missing anything but I can't see why its not working. I've implemented the combobox as per the demo.<br /><br />Each row of the grid has a combobox and a textbox which is slightly different to your demo implementation. I think there is some problem when binding comboboxes to individual data rows.<br /><br />Gareth.<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 04, 2010</h2>In a datagrid you'll need to create your own custom column type, or use a<br />template column, to get the custom combobox type into the column of the<br />datagrid.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Gareth replied on Tuesday, January 05, 2010</h2>Yep I have a template column like this:<br /><br />          (swcd:DataGridTemplateColumn Header="Supplier")<br />            (swcd:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate)<br />                (DataTemplate)<br />                        (tctl:ComboBox x:Name="SupplierCombo" Width="220"<br />                           ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource supplierData}, Path=Data}"<br />                           SelectedValue="{Binding Path=SupplierId, Mode=TwoWay}"<br />                           ValueMemberPath="Id" DisplayMemberPath="DisplayValue" /)<br />                (/DataTemplate)<br />            (/swcd:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate)<br />          (/swcd:DataGridTemplateColumn)<br /><br />Hitting the enter key on the following text column shows that the ComboBox selected value is chosen, however I really want the record to be saved on selection of a combo item. This doesn't seem to work.<br /><br />Gareth.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Peran replied on Tuesday, January 05, 2010</h2>Hi Gareth,<br><br>Your DataGridTemplateColumn xaml does not look like the examples I have seen, you may like to try the following:&nbsp; You are missing a DataGridTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate section where your ComboBox xaml should go, for when the cell is in editing mode.&nbsp; The DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate section is for displaying the value when the cell is in non-editing mode, you would probably use a TextBlock here.<br><br>This link should give you an idea of the xaml required:<br><br>http://weblogs.asp.net/manishdalal/archive/2008/09/28/combobox-in-datagrid.aspx<br><br><br>Regards<br><br>Peran<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
