All of the sample apps are using pop-up window to do data editing.  Is it because E.F. objects do not play well with databinding on the main window green(i.e adding new record to child grid, etc...)?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, September 14, 2009</h2><P>It is certainly true that EF objects don't implement most of the data binding interfaces. I think they only implement INotifyPropertyChanged, which is the bare minimum, and isn't enough for most datagrid controls to operate correctly.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>andy replied on Monday, September 14, 2009</h2>Rocky, Thank you for your confirmation.<br />I just being spoiled by your csla framework and do not expect anything less from out-of-the-box databinding object for a  framework.<br />Just wonder what is the adopting rate for E.F.<br />Does it live up to developer's expectation?<br /><br />Andy</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sergeyb replied on Monday, September 14, 2009</h2>I have been using it with CSLA for a couple of months.  It is a good product, although you can tell that it is version 1 product.  Some of the most painful issues (such as IDs for foreign keys) are addressed in v2 (.NET 4.0).<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: andy [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Monday, September 14, 2009 2:02 PM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] Entity framework editing data<br /><br />Rocky, Thank you for your confirmation.<br />I just being spoiled by your csla framework and do not expect anything less from out-of-the-box databinding object for a  framework.<br />Just wonder what is the adopting rate for E.F.<br />Does it live up to developer's expectation?<br /><br />Andy<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>andy replied on Monday, September 14, 2009</h2>Sergey,<br />I am sure you can use in conjunction with CSLA for your DL.  Any ADO.NET related for that matter.    I just want to use E.F for 2 tiers simple app.  Not sure I want to do so without rich databinding support.<br /><br />Andy  </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sergeyb replied on Monday, September 14, 2009</h2>You can data bind an app to EF classes because they implement INotifyPropertyChange.  You will have to use partial classes probably for validation support since there is no validation in EF itself.  You would also rely on exceptions being thrown from property setters so that your UI (WPF/SL) can listen to those to provide visual feedback to the user.  For a quick and dirty app I'd say feel free to use EF by itself.  For a robust app not a good idea IMHO. <br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: andy [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Monday, September 14, 2009 3:58 PM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] RE: Entity framework editing data<br /><br />Sergey,<br />I am sure you can use in conjunction with CSLA for your DL.

Nor does CSLA do the things they<br />do.<br /><br />Rocky<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: andy [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Monday, September 14, 2009 2:58 PM<br />To: rocky@lhotka.net<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] RE: Entity framework editing data<br /><br />Sergey,<br />I am sure you can use in conjunction with CSLA for your DL.
