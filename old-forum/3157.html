<P>Does anyone know why there is no generic "Find" method implemented in the BusinessListBase &amp; ReadOnlyListBase classes?</P>
<P>Any good&nbsp;workaround other than just implement a "Find" method with the&nbsp;required "predicate"&nbsp;on each class that inherit those classes?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thank you,</P>

However, the predicate methods are on the wish list (<A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/wishlist.aspx">www.lhotka.net/cslanet/wishlist.aspx</A>).</P>
<P>On the other hand, LINQ makes them largely useless, and so I may never implement them.</P>
<P>On the third hand, all these things are dangerous (Find&lt;&gt; and LINQ) because they return lists that are <EM>not linked to the original</EM>. So you might do a find query and get back a list of matching results. You might then add or remove an item from that list - which of course would have <EM>no impact</EM> on the real list...</P>
<P>This is why Csla.FilteredBindingList is probably your best option. It effectively does a find operation that returns all matching results, using a delegate method (much like generic Find). But the resulting list <EM>is linked to the original</EM> so you can add and remove items from the filtered list and those changes are actually reflected in the real list.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ixman replied on Monday, July 09, 2007</h2><P>Hi&nbsp;Rocky, </P>
<P>I'll go for the Csla.FilteredBindingList. The "link to the original list"&nbsp;feature is very&nbsp;handy.</P>
