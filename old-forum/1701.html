<P>I have a payrun root list object which contain individual pays (root busines object). Now my question is this, how would you go about a group save for the pays and not activating until a required at the end. So it's all or nothing.</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, November 07, 2006</h2>You mean you want to update the database within a transaction?&nbsp; You can h andle it manually (and if you're using Csla 1.x you'll have to do it this way) or in Csla 2&nbsp; you can use the Transactional attribute and specify TransactionScope.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Wal972 replied on Tuesday, November 07, 2006</h2>no i want active the save on the pay one after the other, not the database activity</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>malloc1024 replied on Tuesday, November 07, 2006</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am not exactly sure what you are asking but I will try to
help.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Payrun class inherits from
BusinessListBase and the Pay class inherits from the BusinessBase correct?<span>&nbsp; </span>When you edit or add a Pay object you would call
ApplyEdit on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you are done
editing all the Pay objects, you would call Save on the Payrun class to save
all the Pay objects at once.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
