<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do have some server side rules and some client side rules for a business object. And when I am hitting the save button I am explicitly calling the checkrules for the business object. &nbsp;The whole system is working just fine. Even when I am changing field with some data in it and going to the next field it is automatically checking the rules for both sync and async rules. And nothing is broken there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The server side rules are actually async rules. Now what I want is if any of the client side rules (that is non async rules) fails I don&#39;t want to call the server side rules during the object saving process. Can anyone let me know if this feature is already available in CSLA 4.0.1 or do i have to write something for it. Also just an added note I am using Silverlight 4.</p>
<p>Hope I was been clear about my issue. Awaiting your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Use Priority on you rules:<br />Set sync rules to have Priority = 0 (this is the default value so you may not need to change anything)<br />Set async rules to Priority = 1</p>
<p>That should do it. </p>
<p>Explanation:<br />The BusinessRules have a property : ProcessThroughPriority - default value is 0. <br />All rules with lower or equal priority are processed even if a rule is already broken and and the broken rule does not explicitly shorctut RuleEngine (StopProcessing = true).</p>
