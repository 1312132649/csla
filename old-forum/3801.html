To not give out all the sourcecode to everyone (being paranoid about security here), my idea was to create smaller ASP.NET website solutions that later at build time is "merged" together into one big one.</P>
<P>Have anyone tried this before? Or some other "solution" how to partion a ASP.NET&nbsp;project into separate modules to not give 100% of the code away? </P>
<P>Sure, there will be some stuff that will be common for all modules , like master pages/controls and common modules/assemblies. Somehow these has to be incorporated into each sub-modules.</P>
<P>Or is this just a new way to shoot me in the foot twice?</P>

<P>Now if your concern is from an IP standpoint that opens up other challenges.&nbsp; To which I'd say your best defense is a strong NDA.</P>
<P>I must say my gut is you are asking for a headache if each team doesn't at least have an idea about what the other team is working towards.&nbsp; Communication will be your friend here.</P>
