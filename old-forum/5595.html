<P>As I recall there may still be databinding problems in the old code base.</P>
<P>I am planning to jump straight to 3.6 in a few weeks.</P>

From what I understand, this may be an issue.<br><br>I haven't had much of a chance to look at 3.6 yet... I'm just now getting comfortable with 3.0 :)<br><br>Thanks for the feedback... I'll download and start looking at 3.6.<br><br>*** Any other feedback?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Wednesday, October 15, 2008</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I have only read this - no&nbsp;actual experience - but I have read&nbsp;in a few places that CAB/SCSF and WPF don't always play well together.&nbsp; And based on what I've read from MS on this, using&nbsp;that combination&nbsp;will require a kind of hybrid approach, which makes me wonder&nbsp;about the benefits of&nbsp;using WPF in this situation.</FONT></P>
