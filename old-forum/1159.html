I had one form that contained a listview which when loaded will call the getall (returned a dataset) and loaded the dataset into the listview<br>3.&nbsp; The user could click an add, edit, or delete button,&nbsp; all of which passed the listviewitem to the class.&nbsp; The class knew how to populate itself based on the listviewitem passed to it.&nbsp; It also knew what add/edit window to call for updating.&nbsp; <br><br>The most important part of this I could do this using one display form (and the column headers were displayed using aliases in the SQL) and 1 edit window for each table.&nbsp; Using Databinding and CSLA.Net I don't see how to accomplish this without creating a 2 forms one to display the list and one to edit the table.&nbsp; <br><br>What am I missing?<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br>Mike<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>You could use a DataGridView to both view and edit the list.&nbsp; To decide on the columns, iterate over the properties and skip any that are marked with the IsBrowseable(false) attribute.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mr_lasseter replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>Is there an easy way to rename the column headings on the fly? &nbsp;What about the order of the columns?&nbsp; </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>You could clear the columns and recreate them whenever your data source changes.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mr_lasseter replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>I guess this is where MVC proves itself to be so valuable?&nbsp; I am assuming the form should just know that it displays the data source in a datagridview, but the control knows what the column headers should be?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>The grid can 'figure out' what your columns are by looking at the public properties of your business object.&nbsp; Alternately, you can create the columns yourself.&nbsp; The form doesn't necesarly care about what data is in the grid, unless you need it to for some reason.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mr_lasseter replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2><P>I understand that, but the grid cannot figure out what the Display Name should be (ie.&nbsp; property UserID should display as User ID).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>You could put that in your resources file and then retrieve it with a method that turns the object and property into a string and retrieves that from the resources file.<br><br>System.Resources.ResourceManager.GetString("Namespace_Object_Property", ResourceManager.Culture);<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mr_lasseter replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2><P>This is something I will look into.&nbsp; Thanks for your time.&nbsp; </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
