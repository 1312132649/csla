I think this would conflict with your design.  If you still want to do it, you can or you can assign it in code.<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: nobby_trussin [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Thursday, September 24, 2009 8:39 AM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: [CSLA .NET] CSLA for Silverlight and binding to a property<br /><br />Hi,<br />I am developing a Silverlight application using CSLA for SL but have run into a problem with binding so was wondering if someone would be able to help. <br /><br />I am trying to work out how to bind to a property rather than a Factory method using a CSLADataProvider. The examples I downloaded from lhotka.net all seem to use the following pattern where a Factory Method is called to retrieve the data. <br /><br />FactoryMethod="GetTestList"><br /><br /><br />So from my understanding, this XAML tells the data provider to call the GetTestList() method on the ReadyOnlyTestList class and bind to the result.<br /><br />However, I am trying to bind to a list that has already been retrieved and is exposed as a property in a SharedLists class like follows:<br /><br />public class SharedLists<br />{<br />   private ReadOnlyTestList _TestList;<br />...<br />   public ReadOnlyTestList TestList <br />   {<br />      get<br />      {<br />         return _TestList;<br />      }<br />   }<br />...<br />}<br /><br />So I am looking for some example XAML that would allow me to bind to the SharedLists.TestList property.
