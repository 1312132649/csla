I tried adding a project and a resource. In both cases I did not enter any data to see the error logic ( walked through the code while in debug ). I see that the validation error gets set in the project save but....the error label becomes&nbsp;an empty string when the edit page is redisplayed&nbsp;i.e there is no indication that there was an error. In the resource add - same use case&nbsp;- except this time I got a DataPortal Exception not caught by application code run-time error.</P>
<P>Any suggestions on what I need to look at to figure the two scenarios out?</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>So to test this out you need to copy your database file to App_Data and change your connection string to use that location (not an absolute path either!).</P>
<P>OR you can switch to use an external SQL Server instance where you are using a "normal" connection string to a server, rather than a file path connection string.</P>
<P>In short, the issue is with getting ASP.NET to let you talk to the database.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
