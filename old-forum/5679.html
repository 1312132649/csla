<P>I noticed that you've added code in BusinessListBase.IsSavable property to see if a user has authorization to edit the object, and assigned that to a local variable, but on the return statement, you call IsDirty and IsValid first.&nbsp; With short circuting, you'd have better performance if auth is false, if you changed from this:</P>
<P>return (IsDirty &amp;&amp; IsValid &amp;&amp; auth &amp;&amp; !IsBusy);</P>
<P>to:</P>
<P>return (auth &amp;&amp; IsDirty &amp;&amp; IsValid &amp;&amp; !IsBusy);</P>
<P>If auth&nbsp;is false, you'd never have to loop through all the objects twice for IsDirty and IsValid</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, October 28, 2008</h2>Thanks, I'll add that to the to-do list.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, October 28, 2008</h2>Interestingly enough, it was correct in .NET, but not SL - good catch.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
