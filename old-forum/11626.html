<p>Also, if you get the assemblies via nuget, the source is now on a source server so you can walk through the CSLA source in the debugger of necessary.</p>
<p>Personally I&#39;ve switched to nuget for nearly all work because it offers such a great experience for adding and updating references.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Tuesday, October 09, 2012</h2><p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>JonM is making a point: there are no NET4 binaries on the MSI.</p>
<p>When using VS2012 and targeting Framework .NET 4, NuGet shows the correct packges / assemblies. So using NuGet is the only way to use Csla 4.5.3 and target Framework .NET 4.0</p>
<p>Using VS2010 NuGet doesn&#39;t show Csla 4.5.3 even when &quot;Include prerelease&quot; is selected. So for VS2010 people there is no way to use Csla 4.5.3</p>
<p>&lt;edit&gt;</p>
<p>Oops... when &quot;Include prerelease&quot; is selected, Csla 4.5.3 does show under VS2010</p>
<p>&lt;/edit&gt;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, October 09, 2012</h2><p>Ahh, well that&#39;s a bug in my setup program. I&#39;ll fix that!!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Wednesday, October 10, 2012</h2><p>FWIW we moved up to 4.5.3 beta 2 and all 10K+ tests still pass, things look fine for us.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, October 10, 2012</h2><p>That&#39;s great news, thank you!!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
