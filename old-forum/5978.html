What do you mean by navigate through the hierarchy? Also, were you letting the report prompt for the parameters? Can you still specify them problematically? That's what I do with local reports.. specify everything the report needs to run up front, then let it process. Does the reportviewer VS control cache the reports locally?

Well, inteperating the data I usually consider business code, and so it ends up in the business layer.  I was thinking of reports as another use case, and thus build Csla BOs around them.

What's bringing this to light is that I'm trying to keep my Wpf application

this by embedding the reportviewer into a window in my common Wpf library, so
the rest of Wpf needn't worry about it.. but this is posing other problems, for

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The webform control that links with SSRS has all the export
capabilities.  If you just had the control as 100% of the IE window the users
would never even know.  I don’t know if there are more/less features in the web
vs. win control.  But if it’s a static report who cares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why not spawn an ASP page with the reports (WPF has a IE
pluging no)? â€“ or setup a service to take the report request â€“ run the
report, PDF it, and present/email it to the users.&nbsp; Iâ€™ve done that
strategy too.&nbsp; ActivePDF has a great PDF Toolkit that you can intercept
any print function and do PDF wonders with it before sending it back to the
user.<o:p></o:p></p>

I could pop IE into a Wpf window, but I'd like to keep as much rich client
functionality as I can.&nbsp; Using the existing winform control would be
closer to that then trying to embed a web page.&nbsp; Plus, the Winform control
has an export to PDF built in as well... and its what my users are already used
to.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Iâ€™m starting to get a bit worried about what Iâ€™m going
to do J.&nbsp; Iâ€™m also ditching winforms for Silverlight/WPF and hoping to
bypass as much ASP as possible.&nbsp; Granted the reportViewer I just bought
with DataDynamics is winforms/ASP so Iâ€™m going to have a hybrid solution as
well unless I do it all under the covers and just return PDFâ€™s or excel
dumps.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

Ha... reports are the worst part of building this application.&nbsp; It's
tedious and boring.&nbsp; I also feel like it's time to re-think what I'm
currently doing for reports.&nbsp; I've embedded report viewer too much into
the BOs, and I think moving them out of assemblies will allow me to create new
reports more easily in the future.&nbsp; One assembly is 2.57 MB... and 2.2 of
that is the RDLCs embedded inside!&nbsp; Some of those files have embedded
images, which is why they are so large.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm going to have to give users a way to build at least limited reports
in the future... I wouldn't mind creating a new Data Source view to bring
together what they need... but writing the report is something they should be
able to handle.&nbsp; I have enough as it is.&nbsp; <img id="_x0000_i1027" src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile <img src=" />"><br>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Something else to think about is using WebServices as your
datasource.&nbsp; You could still use your BO to do all the datamanipulation and
then just dump the data out.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never used it but that might be a way to
go.&nbsp; Then you just deploy your RDL&#8217;s to the reporting server but get your data
from the webService.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I&#8217;m sure 2008 version has lots of fun bells &amp; whistles that
you could piggyback on but you would definitely separate your logic &amp;
presentation layers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>You can even then setup standard reports that users can get
directly from the repository vs. using your app but they share the same source.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I used crystal in the late 90s.&nbsp; Actually creating the
RDLC was fairly similar, at least from what I remember.&nbsp; I'm checking out
this link currently, since I suspect they are competing products:<br>
http://www.crystalreportsbook.com/SSRSandCR_ExecSummary.asp<br>
<br>
Of course, one I already have, and one will cost more... can't ignore that
either.&nbsp; <img id="_x0000_i1025" src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile <img src=" />"><br>
