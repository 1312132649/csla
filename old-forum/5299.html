<P>This may have been answered before and I am sure someone must have come across this issue. The first statement in the ConvertTo method in the SmartDateConverter.cs in the framework casts the value that is passed into the method to a SmartDate type. If the app is using a nullable smartDate type then the runtime will throw an exception which is happening in our case. </P>
<P>Are there any workarounds to this issue or what does the community suggest we do in this case? Thanks!!</P>

I dont think it is advisable to use a nullable smartDate since the framework assigns a minValue in cases where the date is actually null or empty.
