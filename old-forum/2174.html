<DIV></DIV>I do not think you want an editable list of read-only objects, which 
would not work using the built-in base classes as you would not be able to save 
the items in the list.&nbsp; Beyond that, you are really talking about to 
separate lists: one that the user selects cities from and one of the cities that 
have been selected.&nbsp; I think you would be looking at the following:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>CityList (read only list of cities)
  <LI>City (read only item)
  <LI>UserCityList (list of cities the user has chosen)
  <LI>UserCity (a city the user has chosen)</LI></UL>So the user has a list of 
cities that they can choose from, and the ones that they have chosen are 
persisted to the database.<BR><BR><BR><BR></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
