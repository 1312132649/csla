That would be confusing.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triviany replied on Monday, October 20, 2008</h2>Cheers. My biggest concern was that an object was being returned. However, after reading through replies in the link above, it makes more sense for me to catch the exception thrown by the DP and return null.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><br>T<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, October 21, 2008</h2>Sounds good.&nbsp; Just to be clear though, it's up to your code in the DataPortal_Fetch to throw an exception; Csla doesn't do that for you.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triviany replied on Tuesday, October 21, 2008</h2>Aha! I seem to notice the DP mechanism throwing some sort of an error between the call to DataPortal_Fetch and the return from the business method.<br><br>I better investigate this further. It's always worth knowing how the whole thing works. <br><br>Cheers mate!<br><br>T<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
