<P>Also, I am trying to get a handle on the "Class in Charge" factory pattern but, although it is discussed in C# 2005 Business Objects chapter 2, the sample code does not seem to implement it as described. In particular I would like to see a WCF version of this pattern.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 28, 2008</h2><P>ProjectTracker with CSLA .NET version 3.0 and higher uses WCF.</P>
<P>The <A href="http://store.lhotka.net">Using CSLA .NET 3.0</A> ebook has a chapter on WCF, covering how it is used in the data portal, and how to build WCF services as an external interface to your app.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
