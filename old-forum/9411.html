<p>Seriously though, I dont think so. From what I understand, LightSwitch is a tool and it looks a bit &quot;Accessy&quot;. Even if it kicks off, I would imagine there would be movement to integrate CSLA with LightSwitch.</p>
<p>Also the fact that it is SL only does not help. There are still a lot of folks out there using WPF, Winfworms etc with no view of switching to SL just yet.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Friday, August 20, 2010</h2><p>Lightswitch looks &quot;Accessy&quot; because that&#39;s what it&#39;s intended to target - a .NET replacement for &quot;low-end&quot; Access-style development.&nbsp; There&#39;s been a growing discussion about the barrier to entry in .NET development, which is causing a lot of people to go to Ruby/PHP.&nbsp; Those developers don&#39;t usually switch to .NET when they enter &quot;the big time&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know whether Lightswitch will really compete well in that space, but at least it&#39;s an acknowledgement that something needs to be done.</p>
<p>Given it&#39;s reliance on WCF RIA Services, I don&#39;t think CSLA could be integrated with it, even if Rocky wanted to.&nbsp; But that&#39;s a guess.&nbsp; And given what I see is the intended audience, I wouldn&#39;t see a lot of benefit to CSLA in that environment anyway.</p>
<p>As for the SL-only comment, I believe there are plans to expand Lightswitch to WPF - after all, that wouldn&#39;t be much of a stretch.&nbsp; Of course, MS has had an awful lot of plans over the years...</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, I wrote a bit about Lightswitch with respect to some other &quot;preview&quot; stuff, commenting that there&#39;s just a little too much scatter in the dev tools roadmap:</p>

<p>Today, after seeing a bunch of people dump on Lightswitch for a couple weeks, I added some more thoughts:</p>

<p>I&#39;d really love to see a tool like Lightswitch become a fast-start or prototyping tool that could throw some stuff together quickly for POC purposes, and if there&#39;s a path to grow these prototypes into real applications when needed, so much the better.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve already got people doing code generation of CSLA classes, right? &nbsp;What&#39;s wrong with generating stuff based on an Access-like tool?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, August 21, 2010</h2><p>LS is an interesting technology, and one where I&#39;ve had the opportunity to provide some input - specifically around their n-tier architectural choices.</p>
<p>It is very important to understand that LS has a specific target market - and it isn&#39;t &quot;professional&quot; or &quot;enterprise&quot; developers - though personally I think &quot;professional&quot; is a very slippery term.</p>
<p>If you think back to the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s there was a very large cottage industry of developers (most independent consultants) that made good livings off FoxPro, Clipper, dBase and even Access. This is basically the LS target market - that kind of developer, whether a full-time employee of a company or an independent consultant, or perhaps even a consultant working for a firm (back in those days there were firms that employed this sort of developer).</p>
<p>CSLA is used in that market segment, and by professional and enterprise developers. So LS might replace some use of CSLA at the lower end of the spectrum - and if it is a better tool for those apps, then that&#39;s just great - I&#39;m happy!</p>
<p>But for most of what I think CSLA is used for, I don&#39;t think LS competes - and its value proposition is very different at many levels.</p>
<p>The thing that makes me like LS though, is that it offers much of the simplicity of Access/FoxPro/dBase/etc - but with a solid n-tier architecture lurking beneath the surface. Of course only time will tell if they got all the details right so it really does scale - but it <em>should scale</em> very nicely - they did a good job thinking through the architectural model that is running behind the scenes.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
