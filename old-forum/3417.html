Probably some issues were addressed there so if you don't mind using v3 of CSLA then just stick to&nbsp;using it.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, August 24, 2007</h2>That's correct; in this case, the exception helps you point out that you're not doing databinding correctly.&nbsp; Check the latest project tracker example for how the databinding needs to be done.&nbsp; There's a lot to it, but what needs to be done is pretty clear.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sntslm replied on Friday, August 24, 2007</h2>Maybe I do something wrong with the databinding,but in csla 3.0.2,the exception is disaapeared!So,now I use the new version of csla!<br>Today I will check the Insert/Update/Delete function of my new biz objects.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
