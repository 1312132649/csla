<p class="MsoNormal">Those of us programming on the .NET framework have come to
realize the power and increased productivity that comes with it, says Dr.
Venkat Submramaniam. Like any development, however, there are things that one
should pay attention to while programming on .NET. Are there things in .NET
that, if we do not pay attention to, may result in more trouble than it is
worth? Learn all there is to know in a FREE video workshop conducted by Dr.
Venkat Subramaniam. In the workshop recorded at Saltmarch Media's Great Indian Developer
Summit, Venkat presents Gotchas that a developer needs to know to be productive
in the .NET framework. The issues addressed include framework, language,
language interoperability, COM interoperability. Most Gotchas are language
independent while a few are C# or VB.NET specific. To view the workshop, visit http://www.devmarch.com/video.html<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Venkat Subramaniam will be at Great Indian Developer Summit
2010 to conduct focused conference sessions, a keynote and a workshop on topics
ranging from F# and .NET CLR, effective Java, testing with dependencies, design
patterns in Groovy and Java, Java Generics in version 1.5, functional
programming to pointy haired bosses and pragmatic programmers. The summit will
be held 20-23 April 2010 at the IISc in Bangalore.
