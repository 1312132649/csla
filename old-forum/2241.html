<P>Here's the line of code where the error occurs:&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>Me</FONT><FONT size=2>.Add(Person.GetPerson(dr))</FONT></P>
<P>So I'm sure I'm missing something simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Person root object class, there is no factory method that accepts "dr" as an argument.&nbsp; I could pass in dr.getint32("personID") but that would result in a multiple separate transactions.</P>
<P>Aside from my specific question above, I'm also wondering if anybody can shed some light on how they use the templates.&nbsp; I've been testing different approaches.&nbsp; If anybody can recommend some best practices on usage that would be great.&nbsp; Particularly, I'm wondering what is the best order to do things?&nbsp; I've created the tables in SQL.&nbsp; I've generated basic CRUD stored procedures using the built in codesmith templates.&nbsp; When I'm creating the CSLA classes, I'm specifying the stored procedures in the command object property.&nbsp; Does that sound like typical usage?</P>
<P>Thanks<BR>Greg</P>
