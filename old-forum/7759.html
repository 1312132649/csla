The red icon itself is in the proper place, but when you mouse over it the broken rule description is down and to the right.<br /><br />I saw this in the EditTestObject.xaml page from one of the Silverlight Video series demos and in my own code.<br /><br />Has anyone else experienced this?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, October 09, 2009</h2><P>The broken rule description is actually in a popup window, and could be a list of broken rules. The popup window appears down and to the right of the mouse pointer, which is pretty standard for popup windows.</P>
<P>This is XAML of course, and is therefore stylable. So you can change around many aspects of how this is displayed. I don't know if you can style where the popup window appears though - that might be out of our control as well (much the way popup menus, tooltips and other popup window postions are out of our control).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
