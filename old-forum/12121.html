<p>I have a BLB-object (we can call it list) which holds 5 BB-objects. After I have&nbsp;added&nbsp;a new object to the collection I then use list = list.Save(), and it then enters my Dataportal_Update (where I have my base.Child_Update call)&nbsp;for some reason although the first 5 objects haven&#39;t been changed or altered in any way. After going through Dataportal_Update for all the first 5 objects,&nbsp;Dataportal_Insert is then executed and the new&nbsp;object is added/written to an Xml-file. Shouldn&#39;t&nbsp;Dataportal_Insert&nbsp;be called without first going through Dataportal_Update 5 times, i.e. why are the first 5 objects dirty (IsDirty = true) when they imo actually are not?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Well - then you must investigate how the objects became Dirty. <br />Which field or when it actually became Dirty.</p>
<p>F.ex: If you call PropertyHasChanged the object is marked as Dirty. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pecen replied on Wednesday, August 21, 2013</h2><p>Hi, and thanks.</p>
<p>Sorry, my mistake. Forgot to set using(BypassPropertyChecks) on the Child_Fetch(). I&#39;m just amazed sometimes how much time one can spend looking in the wrong direction. Your answer just made me lift my head and re-think. Thanks again. </p>
