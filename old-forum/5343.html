<P>I use child objects that are not lists fairly infrequently, but one of them involved potentially swapping out a different implementation of an interface (child property of the root was this interface) based on a code selection on the root. </P>
<P>I ended up having to track some additional things on the root manually to facilitate data access as with children getting swapped in/out, potentially swapped out after creation (thus no deletion)... I could not find a way to automatically handle persistence in a perfectly graceful way via the framework. I think I kept a handle of the originally fetched object (in terms of the extra information kept in the root). </P>
<P>I'm sure that's not particularly helpful... </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, September 04, 2008</h2>No, it is helpful.&nbsp; In my case, the root BO is an "Insert only" kind of BO.&nbsp; So I don't need to worry about some of the same things you did, but it's good to know that was the only extra work you had to do.&nbsp; It sounds like I shouldn't have anything to worry about.<br><br>My only question now, and I'm going to dig into the Csla source, is will ChildCreate and ChildFetch honor the RunLocal attribute.. I'm creating a child on the client and don't need the app server to do so, and ChildCreate or Fetch seems most appropriate (since that will call MarkAsChild for me.. I hope!).<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, September 04, 2008</h2><P>That's a good question. I bet it honors the [RunLocal] of the root object. I'd have to look too, though. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, September 04, 2008</h2>It looks like it doesn't perform remoting at all, which in my case is fine.&nbsp; <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, September 04, 2008</h2><P>Yep - just runs in whatever context it's in... so if the FetchChild&lt;T&gt;, CreateChild&lt;T&gt; occurred while on the server, it's on the server, if not, not.</P>
<P>Good to know. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
