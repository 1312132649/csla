I have seen a piece of code called ObjectFilteredList.cs on the net but It seems a bit old and is not part of any supported code base like CSLA and also I&#39;ve checked CSLAcontrib and no such code is included there. In fact the contrib download is only 29k zipped which is not a lot of code. Seems only an extension of the DataPortal or a Proxy. (sorry, haven&#39;t looked too hard there)... </p>
<p>Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has some advice on what is the best implementation for a filtered list... My specific application is for a set of combo boxes in a form and a similar set in a datagridview to be chained... Select the country, the second combo box only contains valid states in the country. Select a state and the third only contains valid cities in that state. </p>
<p>Can be used for any other application but this is my current example. </p>
<p>I have done this before with DataTables and a DataView, but having converted over much of my program to CSLA and now using ReadOnlyListBase and ReadOnlyBase, I don&#39;t want to have to provide a conversion or copy that data only for this one off issue... </p>
<p>Thanks greatly to all those who share CSLA.Net !!!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, January 16, 2012</h2><p>Hi, </p>
<p>The CSLA Contrib project is more like a contribution of code and samples so you should download the latest source code from repository.</p>
<p>For the BindingList based classes you should use FilteredBindingList.</p>
<p>For the ObservableCollection based classes you should use linq queries with the ToSyncList() extension method.<br />The ToSyncList will return an instance of LinqObservableCollection that will attach itself to the underlying list to keep in sync (much like FilteredBindingList does for BindingList deratives). </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
