<P>Could some one please tell me if Rocky has ever mentioned if he will be releasing a new book that covers the CSLA 3.5 from scratch?</P>
<P>In other word, will rocky be releasing another e-book covering just the changes or will he be releasing a full book that covers the CSLA 3.5 bumper to bumper.</P>
<P>Thanks.<BR></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 28, 2007</h2><P>My plan is to release <EM>Expert C# 2008 Business Objects</EM> and <EM>Expert VB 2008 Business Objects</EM> books in June 2008 (or thereabouts). I do not plan to release an ebook covering 3.5.</P>
<P>Whether these books cover things "bumper to bumper" is still a little up in the air. Because .NET 3.0 and 3.5 are additive to 2.0, you can imagine that none of the existing 650 pages would go away, but that I would need to add perhaps another 350-400 pages to cover WPF, WCF, WF, LINQ, etc. The result is a <EM>really huge book</EM>.</P>
<P>Apress thinks that's fine, and so it is likely that this will be the result. But another option is to cut out the "old stuff" like Windows Forms, Web Forms, asmx and raw ADO.NET, and only include the new stuff. </P>
<P>So chop out chapters 9-11, and replace all ADO.NET code in chapter 8 with LINQ. Then the net result is adding perhaps 100 pages. But the reality is that Windows Forms and Web Forms remain quite valid...</P>
<P>And in fact perhaps I should have <EM>yet another chapter</EM> discussing AJAX... Oh, and Silverlight.</P>
<P>Yeah, I can see this becoming a 1200 page book <img src="/emoticons/emotion-3.gif" alt="Surprise [:O]" />&nbsp; </P>
<P>(seriously though - I surely hope it doesn't grow <EM>that</EM> much!!!)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>djjlewis replied on Thursday, November 29, 2007</h2>No doubt this has passed through your mind already,&nbsp; but maybe an option for the future woud be to split the books out into one dealing with just the theory and implementation of the framework i.e. current chapters 1 - 5 and then a seperate book with examples and use of the framework as in a kind of 'CSLA .NET Companion'? (Though I'm sure it would not be quite as black and white as that...)<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Dan.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, November 29, 2007</h2>Don't worry, I'm sure most of us will read it even at 1200 pages.&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Thursday, November 29, 2007</h2><P>What’s coming out first the C# or VB version?</P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I’ll do the C# version first, as my C# books sell more units
than VB. Like Stephen Colbert says, the market has spoken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The June date is an estimation. I can tell you that my work
schedule got a lot hotter in Nov/Dec than I expected, and so I’m not nearly as
far on research as I expected to be right now, so the book will likely slip.
Sad but true…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>June is/was the projected publication date, so allow 2-4 weeks
for printing/distribution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Apress does have a program by which you can buy the book ahead
of time and get electronic access to beta chapters as they come out – before final
editing, etc, but offering an early view of content. You’ll have to get the
details from <a href="http://www.apress.com">www.apress.com</a> – that’s
entirely their thing, I just do the writing </span><span>J</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<P>I was just thinking about this and although you probably already considered this, what do you think about releasing 2 books. </P>
<P>In one of the book you can only talk about how to implement the framework, nothing more. This will be the ideal book for people wanting to get started right away. No inner workings explanations here, you are basically pretending as if the framework was not open source. On the other book you can dive into the details.</P>
<P>I think that there is a lot of people that like to hit the ground running and book number 1 will meet there needs (Short and to the point). Of course, I am sure this wont be an easy thing to do and you may be opening up a can of worms but I just thought I mention it.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>AKaplan replied on Sunday, December 23, 2007</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>I just would like to thank you for your hard work in your research and development. I have read your 2.0 book cover to cover more than a few times. I have been developing a very extremely impressive application using your architecture that I'm sure you'll be impressed with when I'm finished with it. It has reduced an amazing amount of architectural coding, while keeping the architecture very easy to maintain. I can't wait for the 3.5 book to be released. I think I'll read both versions of C# and VB this time as I've only read the VB version previously. Oh, one more thing to add, would you be including in the framework the CSLAContrib as a whole? </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Tuesday, December 11, 2007</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>I, for one, don't see any down side to the 1200-page version.&nbsp; I count it a blessing to get information on that wide a range of technologies from a source I have already come to trust.&nbsp; The more of your knowledge you want to dispense, the more I'll try to take in.</P>
<P>I would certainly hope that there will be a searchable pdf version to go along with it since the 1200 pg version can get a little large for some venues.&nbsp; But I'd sure get both versions and I'd bet most folks here would, too.&nbsp; And the beta chapters via pre-purchase sounds like a good idea, too.</P>
<P>Would those of us who've stuck our heads in our desks and been busy with Windows projects for the last couple of years be able to get a decent grounding in all those topics you mentioned in your book (WPF, WCF, WF, LINQ, AJAX, and Silverlight) or would we need to get a decent foundation in an Intro or Tutorial book (on each?) before we could assimilate your contributions in those areas?</P>
