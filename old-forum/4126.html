<P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Would be better on finding methodinfo to&nbsp;put it in cache for later calls. Cahe can be done in static field like a dictionary of dictionaries protected by ReaderWriter lock. Of course i can do it myself but it would be inconsistent with new releases of CSLA.</FONT></P>

<P>But now i think contrary to my proposition. Methods in famework have not much parameters, i think getting method from the type of the object not much expensive in this case and may be returned at first try. Performance boost&nbsp; would be if there used delegates to the methods (not methodinfo), but in this case we are in need real objects that a long lived and taken from the pool.</P>
