It is designed specfiically to support in-place grid editing in Silverlight, WPF and Windows Forms, where the data binding infrastructure is richer and more immediate than you can get in the web environment.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JohnB replied on Tuesday, March 31, 2009</h2>Ok, I can see that. I have a list of objects that can and will only de edited individually. I was going to use a BLB and just call Save on the BLB after the object is saved but that does not feel right to me. My other option was to use a ROLB and fetch the BB when requested but I figured it would be easier to just use the ERLB.<br><br>John<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
