<p>If this were entirely read only it wouldn&#39;t be an issue; however, I&#39;d like the user to be able to add &#39;Notes&#39; to each record which suggests that each record, although read only, has a collection that is editable - or more precisely, the user can add notes but not edit or delete.</p>
<p>So can I have a read only base class have a collection of editable objects?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, September 11, 2012</h2><p>You can have a &quot;root&quot; editable list as a property on a readonly object. </p>
<p>You must however be aware that you must call save on the &quot;root&quot; editable list and update the readonly object with the newly saved object. </p>
<p>In order to avoid loading to much data I&#39;d prefer to decouple the strucctures. </p>
<p>IE: </p>
<ol>
<li>a list of readonly objects</li>
<li>a &quot;root&quot; editabllye list that is loaded per the selected readonly object. </li>
</ol></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>thaehn replied on Tuesday, September 11, 2012</h2><p>I have done the same thing.&nbsp; I used a command object to save the notes.&nbsp; I put up a child window with and &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons.&nbsp; After hitting &quot;OK&quot; I created the command to save the data.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mehgerbil replied on Tuesday, September 11, 2012</h2><p>Both of you, thanks for the thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hoping that those options were a good fit.</p>
