This was discussed in the previous editions of the books, and you can find examples in the 1.x ProjectTracker app. There are also many discussions on ways to organize your rules on the old forum - searchable at <a href="http://www.searchcsla.com">www.searchcsla.com</a>.<br><br>In 1.3+ you can create rule methods and associate them with properties, and then call CheckRules() to check those rules. The concept is basically the same as the 2.0 approach, but some classes/methods are a bit different. You can find details on how to do this in the 1.3 release notes (<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=12983bcf-4599-4a11-917c-72f3d473883e">http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=12983bcf-4599-4a11-917c-72f3d473883e</a>).<br><br>In 2.0 you can create rule methods and associate them with properties as described in the book. The Assert() concept does not exist in 2.0.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
