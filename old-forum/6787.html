<P>I am wondering if it is possible to build CSLA 3.6 applications on a machine that only has .NET 2.0.</P>
<P>I know that .NET 3.5 SP1 is listed as a pre-requisite for setting up CSLA but I am curious if it would work on a 2.0 server/machine because in the setup, it says to set the virtual roots in the IIS&nbsp;to use .NET 2.0.</P>
<P>Would it work or am I not understanding something fully? Any clarification would be great.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

Especially if you use the like of LINQ or any 3.5 features in your business objects.<br /><br />IIS last time I looked didn't really identify any difference between 2.0 and any higher versions. <br /><br />Here is a forum that I found with a quick search that explains it:<br /><br />http://forums.asp.net/t/1210237.aspx</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, April 14, 2009</h2>No... Csla 3.5 requires Linq, and .Net 2.0 doesn't have linq.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, April 14, 2009</h2>Marjon is correct.<br />ASP.Net shows a tab for .Net 2.0 even through versions 3.0 and 3.5. This is because the basic ASP.Net version did not change with those enhancements to .Net. I think you will see a new tab for 4.0 though.<br />Joe<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lprada replied on Tuesday, April 14, 2009</h2>No, I have test the worst way - In a client with only 2.0 - and does not work.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
