<p>I am working on a WPF application using CSLA version 3.6.0.0. &nbsp;We do plan to upgrade to the current version of CSLA in the future but need to schedule time for regression testing. &nbsp;I have a window with a ListBox control that is bound to an empty BusinessList object. &nbsp;I have a button which opens a window where the user can enter some data to create a Business object and save it then the child window calls back to the parent window and adds that new Business object to the ((businessObjectCollection)ListBox.DataContext).Add(businessObject). &nbsp;But the ListBox does not get refreshed with the newly added object. &nbsp;I saw a post that CSLA uses a style of interface but not the Observable interface which is why the ListBox does not update itself. &nbsp;What should I look at to fix this?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, November 04, 2010</h2><p>There is no easy fix, that&#39;s the problem. Microsoft really put us in a bad place.</p>
<p>WPF uses ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;. Windows Forms uses BindingList&lt;T&gt;. The two are basically incompatible, though WPF sort of works with BindingList&lt;T&gt;.</p>
<p>CSLA 3.x uses BindingList&lt;T&gt;. CSLA 4 defaults to ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;, and has secondary list classes using BindingList&lt;T&gt; for Windows Forms work.</p>
<p>You can search the internet for ways to bind WPF to a BindingList&lt;T&gt;. There are some solutions out there, but none are elegant or easy. That might be your only option though, at least until you can get to CSLA 4/.NET 4.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
