Hope someone can help me out.<br /><br />I have some textboxes bound to nullable decimals, ints etc. The problem is whenever i change a value in these controls and tab out they are reset to the previous values. I dont know what is happening. any ideas.<br /><br />regards<br /><br />cash pat</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, March 03, 2009</h2><P>Does the object property's setter get called (use the debugger to find out)?</P>
<P>If not, and I suspect not, then you have an issue at the UI level where data binding isn't handling this properly, and you probably need to tweak some settings on the textbox controls to tell them to support null values.</P>
<P>If the value does get to the setter, is the setter somehow throwing an exception? That may also cause odd behaviors - set blocks shouldn't throw exceptions, and if it is throwing then there's a bug somewhere (possibly in one of your validation rules).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cash_pat replied on Tuesday, March 03, 2009</h2>The Setter is not being called.
