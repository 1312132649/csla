<p>I just started messing around with the MVVM pattern and I am a getting ready to put it on practice on a small project that I am working on.</p>
<p>My problem is that I would really like to get this MVVM implementation right or at least to be able to get close to getting it right. After looking at some samples here and there I think I have the general idea but just because I think I know how to apply the pattern it does not mean that I really know how to do it.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I think I remember you mentioning something about creating some training videos related to CSLA and MVVM.</p>
<p>Is that still on the radar? If so, is this something that you are paining on doing on the near feature? Like 2 or 3 weeks from now?</p>
<p>Just curious,</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 17, 2010</h2><p>My plan is to do the videos within the next 2-3 weeks - probably 4 with production time.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m a bit torn, because I&#39;ve spent the past few days working with MVVM in VS10 and there are differences in approach if you want to use the designer. So I&#39;m a bit concerned that I&#39;ll do a 3.8 MVVM video and its lifetime will be extremely short.</p>
<p>So then I&#39;m thinking I should keep working through some of the VS10 issues and delay the video by 1-2 weeks - so I can cover VS 2008 and VS10 (to some degree at least) in this project.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lukky replied on Thursday, February 18, 2010</h2><p>Rocky,</p>
<p>Go for the VS2010 video !! I&#39;d rather wait a few more weeks than spend money for &quot;nothing&quot;.</p>
<p>Regards</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Thursday, February 18, 2010</h2><p>Rocky,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Although I am extremely eager to get my hands on those
videos, I also agree with Luc Morin, if you feel is worth the wait then lets
just wait&hellip;.... but hurry up too because we <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><i><strong>really </strong></i></span>need those videos <span>&nbsp;<img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /></span></p>
</div></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 18, 2010</h2><p>It depends on how rapidly people move to VS10 I guess.</p>
<p>Though I can try and address some VS08 and VS10 issues both - but the approaches are different because of the XAML designer actually working in VS10.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Monday, February 22, 2010</h2><p>At least for myself, without a subscription that covers Blend, I&#39;ll be moving to VS 2010 immediately and am actively doing some development in beta 2 right now -- just really find a designer useful. Though I must say, after having used Blend before the VS 2010 designer is kind of disappointing - I find myself doing a lot more hand-editing of XAML with VS 2010 then I did with Blend 2 (when I had it).</p>
<p>Maybe I just need more familiarity with the designer... </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 22, 2010</h2><p>I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t used Blend - it requires a part of my brain that apparently doesn&#39;t work well <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p>
<p>So I&#39;ve spent the past few years typing lots of XAML. What I&#39;m finding is that VS10 makes me unlearn a lot of things. Techniques that are optimal for hand-coding XAML are not optimal for working with the designer.</p>
<p>Interestingly, and perhaps this is habit, some things seem just a lot faster to do by typing XAML than clicking and selecting this, that and the other thing in the Properties window.</p>
<p>On the other hand, being able to drag-and-drop an object onto a form with the result being a fully drawn and bound form is a big time saver. </p>
<p>So on the whole I think having the designer is better than not.</p>
<p>Against my better judgment though, I&#39;m slowly but surely evolving a lightweight UI framework that supports MVVM while enabling full use of the VS10 designer. It is coming together well enough that I&#39;m debating whether to incorporate it in CSLA or make it a separate thing. The only trick is that it requires some features of Csla.Reflection, and of course is designed to work with the new TriggerAction control (designer-friendly replacement for InvokeMethod/Execute).</p>
<p>In any case, I&#39;m going to let it gel more as I continue working.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
