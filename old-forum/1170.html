At least that's my prediction.</P>
<P>In other words, I think that thread needs to be kept in check - moderated even though the rest of the forum is not moderated. So I locked it.</P>
<P>I'm quite happy to entertain ideas on how content can be added to the thread, or how that top-level post can be improved to better point people to a more vibrant FAQ list or something like that. But I can't see how an open thread would be a good or beneficial idea...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, September 14, 2006</h2>I'm sorry, I wasn't clear.&nbsp; I think it should remain locked.&nbsp; Forum users should discuss in this forum what should go in there.. so we'll generate the content, and then send it to you so you can update the FAQ thread.&nbsp; I don't think it should be open at all.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 14, 2006</h2>I'm totally happy with that.<br><br>For that matter, if someone (you? <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" />) wanted to own the FAQ, I'm happy to figure out how to grant permissions so that could happen.<br><br>(as you can see from the existing post, I don't actually know how to do that, so I just used the admin account, but I'm sure it can be done)<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, September 15, 2006</h2>Well, it was my suggestion.&nbsp; I'd like some help creating it, but I wouldn't mind taking responsbility to keep it up to date.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 15, 2006</h2><P>I've added you to a role that allows you to edit that sticky post.</P>
<P>fyi, it also allows you to do other moderator/editor tasks, including editing and removing the posts of other people, but it is the most restrictive level I can find that does what's needed for the sticky post.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, September 15, 2006</h2>Cool.&nbsp; I won't touch anything except my posts or the sticky thread.&nbsp; Must not be very observant though; didn't notice the new buttons when I was browsing the main forum before coming here.&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cmellon replied on Tuesday, October 17, 2006</h2><P>Hi All,</P>
<P>Might be worth putting a link to rockys solution to the Identity issue and GetId,&nbsp;I think it would help with the second FAQ.</P>
