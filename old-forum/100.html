<P>Although the data is stored in the same physical tables, breaking the logic into 2 different objects was definitely the way to go.&nbsp; There's a formal process that actually "converts" a working purchase order into a regular purchase order (one that has been finalized, assigned a PO#, and&nbsp;transmitted to the vendor).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Monday, May 15, 2006</h2>Here's what I do in some of my property set:<br><br>If not IsNew Then<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throw New ApplicationException("You can't edit this field once the data has been saved. bla bla bla")<br>End If<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
