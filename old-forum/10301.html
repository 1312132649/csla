<p>I&#39;m assuming you are calling SetProperty.</p>
<p>Try writing some test code.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ddredstar replied on Tuesday, April 26, 2011</h2><p>Actually, it&#39;s a Editable List object that bound to DataGrid, i changed Property values on UI inside the DataGrid.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Tuesday, April 26, 2011</h2><p>If you&#39;ve put properties on your actual list object (not the child objects it contains), then that&#39;s likely your problem.&nbsp; Databinding in .NET&nbsp;wasn&#39;t originally&nbsp;designed to consider properties on list objects, and I&#39;m pretty sure CSLA list objects don&#39;t consider properties on the list object itself when determining its metastate.</p>
<p>If that&#39;s something you need, then you&#39;ll need to create a parent root object, put your list in that, and put your list-based properties on that parent object.&nbsp; I think it may also be possible to override some behavior in your CSLA list object to consider your list-object properties, but I&#39;m not 100% sure on that.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re saying that changes on your child objects aren&#39;t bubbling up to your list, then it sounds like you may have an issue creating your child objects.</p>
<p>HTH</p>
