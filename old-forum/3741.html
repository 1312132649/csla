<P>I am trying to add ChangePassword functionality in my application.</P>
<P>The first problem&nbsp;I ran into was implementing the GetUser functionality.</P>
<P>This function is supposed to return MembershipUser. As I can't find any membershipuser in CSLA, can&nbsp;I implement one in the CustomIdentity used in PTWEB. And if it isn't fit inheriting from the MembershipUser that already exists in .net and implementing it in the custom identity.</P>
<P>Is this the only way to implement GetUser.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
<P>Greetings.</P>

One of the methods, as you have seen, is GetUser, which can return a MembershipUser instance. Via MembershipUser you can do all kinds of things, such as "ChangePassword". MembershipUser is a class used in the Membership API which has quite a few members.&nbsp;Some of the ASP.Net controls plug right into this Membership API. Obviously there's allure there. </P>
<P>In Rocky's book, this wasn't covered in great deal, as his book is really geared towards CSLA; it wouldn't make sense to walk through fully&nbsp;implementing a Membership provider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>The approach I took was to leverage&nbsp;the built in providers within the .Net framework to take advantage of the full API without building it myself. The weakness with the providers AS-IS&nbsp;is that it assumes the items invoking the membership API are in a place that can directly access the database. This is not necessarily the case - if we utilize a remoting solution we will likely not have the Web server have capabilities to connect to the database. </P>
<P>So, I wrote a couple of clasess to wrap the functionality of the built-out providers which happen to leverage a Csla command class - to use the DataPortal, so that the API can execute on the application server. </P>
<P>The SqlServer providers are right&nbsp;in the .Net Framework - SqlMembershipProvider and SqlRoleProvider. One can download (I'm pretty sure) Oracle ones if that's your flavor. </P>
<P>The thread which contains my code is here:</P>

<P>Alternatively, you can just skip out on&nbsp;using the Membership API --&nbsp;just write out methods&nbsp;invoking Csla command classes&nbsp;to do various things like changing a password, etc. (I've also seen one implementation leverage a Csla "User" class with things such as "password" as members.) </P>
<P>For us, all of the built in implementation of the Membership and Role providers&nbsp;made it worth figuring out how to leverage them. </P>
<P>Good luck,</P>
