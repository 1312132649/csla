I added 2 child objects on UI and then cancel. The issue is one child is removed but another one still exists in the parent&#39;s children collection.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, February 22, 2012</h2><p>Is the object still active in databinding or unboud from the UI when you call CancelEdit? </p>
<p>If the object is still databound then this is the expected behavior. </p>
<p>The object must be unbound before you can call CancelEdit and expect a revert to the BeginEdit snapshot (taken before bound).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 22, 2012</h2><p>To add to this, you should never interact with the object while bound. If the object is bound, you should only interact with the binding source.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
