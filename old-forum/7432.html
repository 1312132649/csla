Nothing above .NET 2.0 works on TS2000. (Customer requirement) So this means I need to roll back to CSLA 3.0.5 according to the download page.<br><br>When recompiling my app, It says "Type or Namespace 'PropertyInfo' could not be found". Also receiving a similar message for 'SingleCriteria'.<br><br>When were these introduced? Will I need to eliminate all Managed properties and go with private backing fields? Any other way around this? <br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Jeff Young<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, August 11, 2009</h2>Hi Jeff, <br><br>I have downgraded Csla 3.6.3 to run on&nbsp; .Net 2.0 SP1 (in Visual Studio 2008) and Rocky will be releasing it soon. This version contains support for ManagedProperties, SingleCriteria,  support for Linq2Objects, almost all of the new C# 3.0 syntax and lots more. <br><br>Code and samples are checked into csla subversion repository. <br><br>Send me an email on jonny.bekkum(a)gmail.com and I can send you the svn addresses. <br><br>We have been running this version on .Net 2.0 for almost a year (since Csla 3.5) and upgraded it continuously at one of our largest clients that are still using W2K clients.<br><br>/jonnybee<br><br><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RedShiftZ replied on Tuesday, August 11, 2009</h2>email sent. :D Thanks.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RedShiftZ replied on Tuesday, August 11, 2009</h2>Many Thanks JonnyBee!!!<br>That works like a champ and saved me days of fixing my objects.<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
