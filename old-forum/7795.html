Since all I needed was to create Properties, Parameters and SafeDataReader fields, I thought I was all set.  But a strange thing is happening.  In any place a Column name has the word 'Category', it gets eliminated.  'CategoryKey' becomes 'Key', 'RootcategoryKey' becomes RootKey and 'CategoryName' becomes 'Name'.  Unfortunately the word 'category' occures in almost all of my tables.<br />I have looked around to see if I can modify the templates but haven't discovered what to change. <br />Any ideas would be appreciated. Are there any other C# templates that could do the job.  Thanks.<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Thursday, October 15, 2009</h2>There is an option for UniqueColumnNames which is supposed to be used only when generating against views or storedprocs.<br /><br />I added the names my columns to this option.  While it didn't work consistently with tables, it does work with storedprocs, and I am assuming the same will be true with views.<br /><br />Javed</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rasupit replied on Thursday, October 15, 2009</h2>That's only true if the table name is Category.&nbsp; By default, any column name contains table name will be shortened.&nbsp; If you don't like this option, you can search for GetPropertyName method in TemplateBase.cs then remove the lines in red.<br><br>public static string GetPropertyName(DataObjectBase col)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string name = col.Name;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //ensure first character is capital letter<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name = name.Substring(0, 1).ToUpper() + name.Substring(1);<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //convert ex:START_DATE or Start Date to StartDate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (name.IndexOf('_') &gt;= 0 || name.IndexOf(' ') &gt;= 0 || name == name.ToUpper())<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name = CsHelper.MakeProper(name);<br><br><font color="#ff0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //fix name that contain table prefix<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //ex table:Project column:ProjectName, ProjectDescription<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(col is ColumnSchema)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name = name.Replace(((ColumnSchema)col).Table.Name, "");<br></font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (name.EndsWith("TypeCode"))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name = name.Substring(0, name.Length - 4);<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(name.Length == 0)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw new Exception("Column " + col.Name + " has resulted blank property name");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return name;<br>}<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Sunday, October 18, 2009</h2>Thank you.  That was indeed very helpful - and it worked.  Thanks also for your tireless contributions.<br /><br />BTW, I cannot find the download links anymore - has this project been terminated?<br /><br />Jav<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, October 18, 2009</h2>Hi,<br><br>No it's alive and in activity. <br><br>Download all code from the "Source Code" folder. On the right hand side you will find "Latest version" and the download button. <br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Saturday, October 24, 2009</h2>Aah!
