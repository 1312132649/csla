I have been working on it for over a year, I just haven't been using the sourforge site. I have a small google group set up for testers that has been somewhat private so far, where a small group of people have been giving ideas and bug reports over the last few months. I use it on my every day tasks and although it's still not perfect, maybe it's time for me to open up the forum and have a more widespread testing.<br><br>You can check it out here:<br>http://groups.google.com/group/CslaGenerator<br><br>The idea is to move it to codeplex at some point, but in order to do that we need to make some changes, like removing dependencies on some ui libraries.<br><br>I hope you like it.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sam replied on Wednesday, November 29, 2006</h2><P>Hi Andres,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have look at the csla generator google groups.It is great help for me.But for now i just want </P>
<P>the simple overview of&nbsp; this project.What we have to do it with that xml metabase and what's the use of it.</P>
<P>plz help</P>

Now there's a "Generate" button in the toolbar, so you don't have to interact with codesmith.<br><br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Thursday, November 30, 2006</h2><P>The "private" work you're doing implies a pending new version???</P>
<P>I'll be constructively frank here - I really liked the concept of the tool but thought the UI was a bit lacking.&nbsp; In particular, the property grid for mainting the BO's properties seemed so crude.&nbsp; I was really looking more for someting like the server explorer or data sources explorer in Visual studio - A treeview kind of navigation where I can see things more visually.</P>
<P>Ultimately, a nice graphical UML-like&nbsp;designer would be ideal, but now I'm just wishing out loud.&nbsp; :)</P>
<P>Can you give any more details about what the next version might look like compared to the current one, other than the "generate" button.&nbsp; :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Thursday, November 30, 2006</h2>You (or anyone else) can take a look at it here:<br>http://groups.google.com/group/CslaGenerator/ (I thought I posted the link already, sorry)<br><br><br>The property grid isn't going anywhere, although I'm open to ideas. It would be hard to implement something like that in a tree....<br>I'm curretly moving the codebase to .net 2.0. I'll post a new version soon.<br><br><br>Andrés</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sam replied on Tuesday, December 05, 2006</h2><P>Hello friends ,</P>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Wanted to update this post as a lot of information in this post is no longer relevant. CodeSmith is on our third major version of the <a href="http://www.codesmithtools.com/generate-csla-code-with-templates.aspx">CSLA templates</a>. We have an <a target="_blank" href="http://community.codesmithtools.com/Template_Frameworks/f/68.aspx">active community around the templates</a> and a template issue tracker located <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/codesmith/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=Framework%3DCSLA">here</a>.</p>
