Hopefully someone can help with a solution.</P>
<P>My Csla Classes are:<BR>Invoice (Editable Root)<BR>&nbsp;--&gt; SubInvoiceCollection (Editable Collection)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; SubInvoice (Editable Child)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; InvoiceDetailCollection (Editable Collection)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; InvoiceDetail (Editable Child)</P>
<P>The InvoiceDetail Class contains an amount field which is editable.&nbsp; Any changes to the amount field should be propagated to the InvoiceDetailCollection, which I have done using the Observer pattern.&nbsp; The InvoiceDetailCollection is responsible for notify the SubInvoice that its CalculatedAmount has changed, which I have also done using the Observer pattern.&nbsp; The SubInvoice contains a readonly property that exposes the InvoiceDetailCollection.CalculatedAmount.&nbsp; So when the SubInvoice class receives notification from InvoiceDetailCollection it calls PropertyHasChanged("CalculatedAmount").</P>
<P>On the UI I have this setup using parent - child databinding (each are displayed in 2 different DataGridviews).&nbsp; This is all working correctly, when I update an amount in the InvoiceDetail Grid I see my changes appear in the SubInvoice Grid.&nbsp; The problem is when the SubInvoice grid refreshes, the current selected cell of the InvoiceDetail Grid is moved to the first column.</P>
<P>Any advice on how to keep the cursor on the selected column?</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR>Mike<BR></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
