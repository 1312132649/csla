client's machine. <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Misled replied on Sunday, May 14, 2006</h2>Are you sure about the control?

<P>We have been using NetRun and the Assembly.LoadFrom for many months with no issues.&nbsp; So I can vouch for the fact that this mechanism has worked pre-2.0.&nbsp; Post-2.0 is another story.</P>
<P>Its troublesome that the Assembly.LoadFrom call now does not retrieve the latest version from the server.&nbsp; The only way to get the lastest version&nbsp;is to clear the temporary internet files.&nbsp; This is not a valid deployment requirement for our users.</P>
<P>It would be great to know&nbsp;if anyone using .NET 2.0 has verified that NetRun (Assembly.LoadFrom) actually works...</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>an idea for you ....</P>
<P>click-once was designed to isolate app dependancy so that for example 2 or more versions could be installed w/o stomping out each other.</P>
<P>while the path is "hidden" it is still there, I think with a bit of care you can build code to "find" the apps. what about having links to the app's in a known location ?</P>
<P>each app puts a link in say program files\complex app\links\</P>
<P>and each app can build a list of links to other apps to run on the fly...</P>
<P>each time a click-once app is updated it re-writes it's link so all the other apps can find it via the link.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mcerisano replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2>
