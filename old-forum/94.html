<P>Amazon now shows the book in stock as of May 5th (instead of May 8th as before) but my copy has not yet shipped.&nbsp; Although my account shows a delivery estimate: May 16, 2006 - May 18, 2006 .</P>
<P>Has anyone got the VB 2005 book yet? (other then Rockford that is).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jan replied on Saturday, May 13, 2006</h2><P>Hi Steven,</P>
<P>You could order the beta-book which is available from the apress website.&nbsp; Currently the full RTM version of the VB book is available for download.&nbsp; Available today, fast, easy to print chapter by chapter and searchable&nbsp; (and only 30 dollars).</P>
<P>Regards,</P>

<P>While I fully understand the economic rational for your comment, I would like to propose a counter argument. Stop buying print and only buy ebooks in the future. My rational...</P>
<P>1) Cheaper... in total. Especially if you went the beta route as suggested above. </P>
<P>2) Lighter... try carrying 3-4 software books into Starbucks for a relaxing early morning read. (Not to mention tagging yourself as a bit of a SW geek.)</P>
<P>3) Encourage publishers to improve this delivery mechinism. This is truely a under developed technology.&nbsp; (But that is a whole other discussion.)</P>
<P>4) Electrons don't grow on trees... </P>
<P>Cheers,</P>

<P>Valid points I suspect but did it ever occur to you that some of us actually like turning pages on paper books and the feel of a book in our hands.</P>

<P>My Table of Contents page X is blank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am missing the Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 page.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Is this just my copy or is anyone else missing this page?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, May 18, 2006</h2>It appears blank in my copies as well, so it must be a printing issue. I've contacted Apress to find out what's up.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Thursday, May 18, 2006</h2><P>I got my VB book from Amazon yesterday.&nbsp; It's a great read, reinforcing the lesson learnt -&nbsp;all of which seems a lot easier to grasp&nbsp;now that I have been using the Csla for more than a year.</P>
<P>I did notice that in chapter 7, the Editable Root object does not list the Save method in the Factory Methods region.&nbsp; I did look for a coincidence to see if the page number in this case - 385 - was one of those&nbsp;on the blank page in TOC but no, no that wasn't it.&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /> </P>
<P>Thanks Rocky - I don't recall ever waiting so anxiously for a book - and it was well worth the wait.</P>

<P>Then yesterday I got the e-mail saying the book had shipped.&nbsp; I don't know if my order editing bumped it up to some required attention level or my timing was just a coincidence.&nbsp; But I'm expecting mine tomorrow.&nbsp; And any of you that ordered from Bookpool should have probably received notification, too.&nbsp; If you didn't, try editing your order (or killing it off and starting over).</P>
