Everything works fine if I host it on another server running&nbsp;IIS6 so I know it's not the binaries. At this stage I haven't tried remote debugging&nbsp;but just thought someone else may have tried this and know what needs to be done with&nbsp;the IIS configuration to make it work?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>David replied on Monday, July 30, 2007</h2>Sorry,&nbsp;please ignore this. The problem was actually to do with the database connection string and it is all working fine now.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
