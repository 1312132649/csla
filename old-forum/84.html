I have to create a Parent/Child set of objects.<br>So for the parent I was going to create a shared function to call from the UI that would instantiate the parent object and load the data from the database. Like I've seen in the book. <br>The question I have is do I need to do the same thing with the child object? Since when I'm loading the data into the instantiated parent object I'm already on the remote server it seems I could just create the child without a shared factory method. Or does that break the idea of CSLA?<br>I hope this makes sense and thank you.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, May 12, 2006</h2><P>You certainly could just expose a Friend/internal scoped constructor on your child classes. As you can see in Chapter 7, I prefer to be consistent and use a factory scheme for all my objects, but that's really personal preference.</P>
<P>The factory method is pretty much required for any root object, otherwise you can't interact properly with the data portal. But for non-root objects (within reason) I suppose you could say anything goes.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Discord replied on Monday, May 15, 2006</h2>Consistency... I didn't think about that. Seems like a good reason to use the factory functions for non-root objects too. Thank you for the reply and great framework.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
