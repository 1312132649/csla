I have a master/detail arrangement where the master object is a BusinessListBase derived from a BusinessBase object. This BusinessBase object has a property that is a list of child objects which is another BusinessListBase derived from another BusinessBase object. I have a form divided into two parts on the left side is a grid where the master list is displayed, on the right half I&#39;m displaying the master BusinessBase details. The problem that I&#39;m having is that as I move up and down in the list on the left, the details on the right &quot;CanSave&quot; is always true when it shouldn&#39;t be and I don&#39;t understand why, can someone please try and explain what might be happening</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
