<P>Ivan,</P>
<P>I have just tried out what you are suggesting and it works fine for me. In my case I have a property called description in a customer parent BO and a description field in a one to one customerAddress child object, I have set the binding in code in the way you describe and it works.</P>
<P>How about doing a bit more checking before changing your approach?</P>
<P>Regards,</P>

<P>The only thing I can suggest about your ‘parent object code property appears in the child object code property’ issue is that there must be some mix up with how you are doing your data binding on this form. When I get confused I often try just recoding the form from scratch. As you know from the form that does not confuse the two, this technique does work.</P>
<P>I have not found a way to bind 1:1 child object properties to columns in a grid when the grid is bound to the parent’s binding source. The way I would try to get around this is to surface the child object properties as properties in the parent. In other words, have a parent property that wraps the 1:1 child property. This parent property can be bound in the normal way.</P>
<P>I have not come across a really good technical discussion on windows forms data binding. I have learnt as much from Rocky’s books as anywhere else. Please let me know if you find one.</P>
