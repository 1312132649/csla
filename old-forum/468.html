<P>I know it is possible to do this, but I can't figure out what I am doing wrong.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated!!</P>

<P>I actually haven't done this with CSLA and VS 2003, so I may be off base here, I do know I had to do this with another framework...</P>
<P>IIRC, there's a bug/missing feature&nbsp;in 2003 so you have to do this manually every time you want to step in. Put a breakpoint in your code somewhere before CSLA stuff is called. When you hit the breakpoint, goto Debug | Windows | Modules (Ctrl-Alt-U). You'll notice that the assemblies you want to reference say "No symbols loaded". Right click on the assembly you want and choose "Reload symbols". You may need to browse to choose the assembly.</P>
<P>Should work from there. Kind of a pain. This actually worked properly in a pre-RTM version of 2003, but doesn't work right in the release version.</P>
<P>HTH,</P>
