Typically this would be a Windows service, but you could do it as a console app, or Windows app as well - though not in a server environment. Obviously you'll configure the custom host to listen on a tcp:// address. Ingo Rammer's book, Advanced .NET Remoting, probably has the info you need to do this.</P>
<P>Then on your client, just use a tcp://address-to-the-service/DataPortal.rem style address to reach the server.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>virik replied on Monday, April 23, 2007</h2><P>Thank you for your answer! It is very helpful!</P>
<P>Could you tell me shortly how to bind this component with your CSLA framework? </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 23, 2007</h2>All you need to do is create a custom host that listens on the tcp channel, where you directly expose the Csla\DataPortal\Hosts\RemotingPortal class as a SingleCall component. If you look at how this is done with IIS/ASP.NET in Chapter 4 you'll get the idea - but you need to do it somewhat differently in a custom host than in ASP.NET - which is where Ingo's book will likely be helpful.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
