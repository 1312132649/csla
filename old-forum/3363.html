I am someone who has done development in both Java and .Net platforms and your framework, design patterns stand out as one of the best out there. We have started used this great framework very recently on a large application and are really excited with it. I intened to borrow some of the principles from this framework and port them to Java (for our own internal use). <br><br>Thanks again.<br>Narinder.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
