<P>It appears the paraphrased answer (from page 97) is that since both read-only and editable objects use the interface, it has no common behaviours. But it is useful for detecting whether an object is a business object..</P>

In the longer term I do think you'll see the interface gain some members. Interestingly enough though, there are relatively few common behaviors across all business objects - at least not ones that are (or should be) public.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
