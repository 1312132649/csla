<P>My source list is list of editable root objects.</P>
<P>Filtering and sorting works properly.</P>
<P>However New or updated records are not saved to the database eventhough they are updated in the list on screen.</P>
<P>Can anyone give me a solution to this problem ?</P>

<P>If you bind to the SortedBindingList then any changes made to it are really made to the underlying list.</P>
<P>When you bind to the ObjectListView you have to locate the correct object and take action on it. I do not think that databinding can do this for you but I am not sure.</P>

<P>Thanks for your answer</P>
<P>Can you provide some sample code which uses ObjectListView to persist records to the database ?</P>
