<p>I am basing my applications ample in the InventoryDemo and utilizing Csla.Xaml and the ObjectFactory.&nbsp; How would I go about searching for a particular Product, Warehouse, or Customer utilizing that example?</p>
<p>I was using the MVVMLight toolkit a while ago and figured somethings out with that by using properties and the OnChange event to trigger the requerying of the object, but I am battling with getting my head around triggering a change here and also how to use the Criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some instances where I want to pass multiple criteria so I probably will have a search button for multiple search items but may have the search triggered automatically if only one item is being searched on.&nbsp; Any help/guidance/ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>The Telerik controls rock.&nbsp; If you haven&#39;t used them, check them out.&nbsp; They work great with Rocky&#39;s MVVM objects and are just so easy to use.</p>
