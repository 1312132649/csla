So my question is whats the best way to pass parameters to this object if you have more than a few e.g. with the AddAssignment method is passed in 5 parameters. Should i wrap them up in an object? <br><br>Any advice is much appreciated.<br>Thanks<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
