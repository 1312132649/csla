<P>I am newish to using CSLA, I am looking to implement the functionality from the sortedbindinglist from an earlier version&nbsp;and the latest filteredbindinglist from version 2.1</P>
<P>I am able to get these working individually (Can sort a sorted binding list, Can Filter a filtered binding list)</P>
<P>The trouble i am having is when trying the sort and filter the same list. </P>
<P>I have tried to bring some code into filteredbindinglist from sortedbindinglist to apply the sort to this list but i get a notAllowed exception as SupporstSorting is False in IBindingList.SupportsSorting</P>
<P>Is there a way of using the functionality from these two classes with one list in the UI or do i need to merge the underlying filteredbindinglist&nbsp;and sortedbindinglist classes</P>
<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am struccling with this one for quite a while and need to sort it out once and for all</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, October 10, 2006</h2>You can use them in combination - you don't need to merge their code (which would be quite hard).<br><br>Dim x As New List(Of String)<br><br>Dim s As New SortedBindingList(x)<br>s.ApplySort()<br><br>Dim f As New FilteredBindingList(s)<br>f.ApplyFilter("Test")<br><br>The result is a sorted, filtered list: f.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jphegarty replied on Tuesday, October 10, 2006</h2>Thanks Rocky, thats great</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
