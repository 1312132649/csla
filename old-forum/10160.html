<p>If you purchase, or have purchased, the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;ProductID=22"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Using CSLA 4 ebook series</span></strong></a>, you can also download this new ebook, because it is part of the series.</p>
<p>This 214 page ebook (in PDF format) covers the four data access models supported by CSLA .NET, focusing on the two models that provide the best maintainability and flexibility without incurring undo complexity. </p>
<p>The book walks through each business object stereotype, demonstrating how to implement the encapsulated invoke and factory implementation data portal models. It also demonstrates the use of ADO.NET, ADO.NET Entity Framework, and mock database access technologies.</p>
<p>The book includes several sample applications that provide complete implementations of persistence to accompany the concepts and techniques discussed in the book.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lazaroms replied on Friday, March 11, 2011</h2><p>Hi Rocky:</p>
<p>Does this ebooks series is focused to VB too or just to CS like the ProjectTracker project?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Right now the sample apps are C#. Once I get through the draft process I&#39;ll use Instant VB to convert them to VB as well - but I do not plan to create and maintain two versions of the books.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
