<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm getting 2 table data and then have to related them with Foreignkey relationship. (Dataset with 2 tables and relation). How can I do this with 2 lists in CSLA.</P>
<P>I first read both list then attach them with relation (masterkeyid and foreignkey id). Is it possible or not in CSLA. I cannot read each master's detail because it will end as very slow load.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks,</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
