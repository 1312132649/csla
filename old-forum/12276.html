<p>However, I discovered that once the <i><b>Shown </b></i>event had completed, it was at this point that the principal was reverting back to the Generic Principal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving everything to the <b><i>Load </i></b>event , rather than the <i><b>Shown</b></i>, fixed my issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know <i>why </i>this was (they are DevEx Forms too if it is specific to this) though!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
