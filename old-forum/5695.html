<P>Hi,</P>
<P>I have a form with two usercontrols, lets say one for company details (parent) and the other Contacts (children).</P>
<P>I have created my Business Classes and have successfully managed to databind on the form between text boxes (company details) and grid (contacts), everything works fine.</P>
<P>I have now decided to split the controls up into user controls, as I will be reusing both controls elsewhere in the application.</P>
<P>This is where my problem arises, how can I shares the BindingSource of usercontrol Company with usercontrol Contacts.</P>
<P>I hope I have made sense, any help would be appreciated.</P>
<P>Many Thanks</P>
<P>Andy</P>
