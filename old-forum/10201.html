<p>I have developed a windows application where i have created a form its looks similar to ProjectTrackers Role Edit form. i have copied the code from project trackers role edit form and i am using grid to create and edit data.</p>
<p>actually i have added few more properties</p>
<p>Id Byte</p>
<p>Code Byte</p>
<p>Name string</p>
<p>In single object i can change &#39;name&#39; property and even i can save but not Id and Code properties</p>
<p>when i change code property, it changes the value of code property but its remains unsavable or not dirty.</p>
<p>when i change name property it changes property and also savable and its dirty.</p>
<p>ex: when i make code from 1 to 2 when i check the property value it&nbsp; shows as 2, but its not savable or dirty.</p>
<p>but when i change name from ABC to XYZ then it is savable and dirty.</p>
<p>Could&nbsp;anyone please suggest.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

It sounds like you might have got some of the the&nbsp;get/set accessors&nbsp;and the actual set/getproperty calls mixed up and certain properties are being set incorrrectly</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
