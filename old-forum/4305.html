The children are then bound to a grid. If I do Grid.EndEdit or Bindingsource.EndEdit I still can't save the children. I'm never calling beginedit. When I try to Save I get "Object is still being edited and can be saved". I tried a "ApplyEdit" from the Invoice. You can't do "ApplyEdit" on the children because they are child objects. I know I'm doing something stupid here. Help please.....</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 06, 2008</h2>You need to unbind the objects from the UI. This is discussed in the <EM>Using CSLA .NET 3.0</EM> ebook and illustrated in the CSLA .NET 3.0.3+ PTWin project.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Misled replied on Wednesday, February 06, 2008</h2>How did I miss that!!!......
