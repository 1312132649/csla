I have a usual editable&nbsp;form and the moment I assign the main datasource to my CSLA object as per usual:</P>
<P>myBindingSource.DataSource = myBoObject;</P>
<P>in the&nbsp;Output window&nbsp;I get a couple of the following messages:</P><FONT color=#00ff00 size=1>
<P>A first chance exception of type 'System.ArgumentException' occurred in System.Windows.Forms.dll</P></FONT>
<P>I think it has a (slight) performance hit but more than anything it bugs me that I cannot find out the source of the problem. Is there anyway of finding out where these exceptions get generated?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, January 05, 2009</h2>You could probably set VS to break on all exceptions, and if you have the pdbs for the .net framework you should be able to see the code.<br><br>My experience though is that these messages print, and I'm not sure why... but it looks like the exception is handled in the library and you needn't worry about it unless your form isn't working.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triplea replied on Wednesday, January 07, 2009</h2><P>Thanks I didn't know you could (or how to) do that.

<P>In my case these occur in my code but could never pin point where they occured. Now its fixing time...</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
