<P>A related issue that can happen is that the debugger may evaluate Properties that you didn't actually execute, and if you get&nbsp; stack overflow in that situation the same thing will happen. Debugger evaluation of properties that your code really didn't execute can really create some bizarre symptoms if your property getter has side-effects.
