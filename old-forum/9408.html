<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, August 21, 2010</h2><p>You should pass any values required by Child_Fetch() as a parameter to FetchChild(), and thereby to the Child_Fetch() method.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
