All you have to do is have your object implement their simple IDXDataErrorInfo interface, which is&nbsp;straightforward&nbsp;given the CSLA BusinessRules implementation.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 17, 2008</h2><P>Unfortunately you must remember that the Microsoft grid (and data binding in general) only understands the concept of an error. They have no concept of warning/info messages.</P>
<P>So you have to address this in your UI code in some manner - by creating a custom control, using a third party control that can understand the concept, or something along that line.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Thursday, July 17, 2008</h2><P>Okay.&nbsp; Thanks for the help.&nbsp; I'm actually suprised that the datagridview doesn't offer any more help in this area.</P>

Handle the CellEndEdit event and then loop through the BrokenRulesCollection you can then find your warnings and set the Cells[index].ErrorText. The error icon will show in the cell not in the row header like a real error, but it gives you the needed feedback.</P>
