But before implementing anything I would like to know if CSLACE does have some similar functionality or if anyone knows any better idea.<br /><br />Thanks a lot!<br /><br />Greetings!!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, April 01, 2009</h2><P>I don't believe it does. CSLA CE is based on the CSLA .NET 3.0 codebase, which pre-dates the new PropertyInfo&lt;T&gt; syntax. The new PropertyInfo&lt;T&gt; syntax allows you to attach metadata to a property without resorting to reflection.</P>
<P>You can absolutely do what you describe. Just be aware that the reflection calls to retrieve custom attribute data are among the most expensive reflection calls you can make. Due to this, you'll probably want to figure out a way to do the reflection once and cache the results for the lifetime of the application.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>byle replied on Thursday, April 02, 2009</h2>OK, I'll create a cache to store all read attributes.

Thanks a lot for the advice!
