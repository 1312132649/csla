As the name of the class implies, it has one managed property 'Id' of type 'int'. Let's say I have BO named 'Project' which extends the BusinessBaseWithId&lt;T&gt; and has one managed property named 'Name'.<br><br>When using local proxy everything is OK. FieldManager of the returned 'Project' object shows 2 PropertyInfo objects in the '_propertyList' collection (Name and Id).<br>But when switching to the WcfProxy there is only one item in the property list collection (Name), the Id property info is missing.<br><br>I know the problem with static fields that need to be initialized before using BO. I already have the following code in the base class:<br><br>private static int _dummy;<br>protected BusinessBaseWithId()<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; _dummy = 0;<br>}<br><br>In fact I can't belive I ran on a bug that is so easy to find. I still belive I'm just missing something.<br><br><br>-- Jure<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Saturday, September 06, 2008</h2><P>Set the dummy flag within OnDeserialized as well. </P>
