<P>say an order was placed and u need to send an email to your customer of the order reciept? how is this handled in csla? </P>
<P>or what about just normal emailing of private&nbsp;or group&nbsp;messaging using csla?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, February 20, 2008</h2>This is something I think should be handled outside of Csla.&nbsp; I use Sql Server Notification Services, but that's going away in Sql Server 2008, but for Sql 2008 I think the answer is supposed to be Reporting Services.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, February 20, 2008</h2><P>Emailing is not a CSLA function.</P>
<P>It can be part of your application though.</P>
<P>I have a table in my DB where I enter basic information required for an email.</P>
<P>I have a scheduled job that runs every X minutes which reads that table and sends email messages and then clears the row after the message is sent.</P>
<P>The objects to fill the table and send the emails are built using CSLA.</P>

<P>Hey!</P>
<P>This app was designed this way since 1997! </P>
<P>SQL Server must have copied us. &lt;g&gt;</P>
<P>Besides, I needed it to work with Oracle too. (Which we finally got rid of!!!! YEAHHH.)</P>
