<UL>
<LI>One will only need to make the Contructor in the original object Protected.</LI>
<LI>In the SubClass (root)&nbsp;Private Contructor, do not call "MarkAsChild"</LI>
<LI>Provide a GetObject and Save in the Factory Methods</LI>
<LI>Provide a Criteria class if necessary</LI>
<LI>In DataAccess region, provide a DataPortal_Fetch and a DataPortal_Update</LI></UL>
<P>How does this sound?</P>

<P>The constructor doesn't need to be protected though, does it? Since the inherited class IS also the&nbsp;base class, it should be able&nbsp;to call the&nbsp;private constructor.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Friday, May 26, 2006</h2>Actually, constructors aren't inherited in the normal sense anyway, so I really think you'd want to stay with the private one to make sure that's what's called when you instantiate via the private one in the inherited class.&nbsp; Yes, no, maybe so?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Friday, May 26, 2006</h2><P>Yes, y'all have reached the right conclusion.&nbsp; For a class to be inheritable, it has to have at least a Protected access Constructor.&nbsp; Since writing my original post, I have gone ahead and implemented the scheme in an object that was becoming unmanageable as a switchable.&nbsp; Everything has worked just fine.&nbsp; In fact in all my UI custom controls, where the previously switchable control is being used in data binding, I have had to make not a whit of change.&nbsp; I simply pass the new root control to the same controls.</P>

The member has to be declared protected so that it can be called from an inherited class. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, May 26, 2006</h2>LayerDev,<br><br>You are right; sub classes cannot call private members.<br><br>This also applies to constructors; you'll get a compiler error if you try to subclass from a class which only has a private constructor.<br><br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
