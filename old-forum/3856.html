<br>the code inside childclassA and childclassB is 100% identical, except for the name of the class and the "inherits" line.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that it will always be this way. (they won't diverge in the future, in fact, the divergence is maintained in the parent classes).<br><br>I don't want to simply copy/paste my code from one class to the other. The REAL answer is multiple inheritence, which isn't supported in VB.NET.&nbsp; Is there some sort of "include file" technology I could use to put code in one place and have it used in 2 classes?&nbsp; Do partial classes help at all here?<br><br>To pre-emptively answer any questions about reorganizing the classes, I can't do that here.
