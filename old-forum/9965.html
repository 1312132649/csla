<p>I&#39;m seeing strange behaviour in my business object with regard to ChildChanged. &nbsp;If I handle this in my root BO and load the object via my factory I&#39;m getting a lot of ChildChanged evenst raised, should this be happening or is there a problem with my Factory.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want the events to be raised, you need to turn off event handling on your collections (RaiseListChangedEvents to false) - though that won&#39;t entirely disable them - just the ones that trigger off collection changed events. There is no way to disable property changed events, and those can also cascade up as child changed events.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, January 20, 2011</h2><p>And if there&#39;s code in Child_Changed that you do not want to run during load yuo could check if ApplicationContext.LogicalExecutionLocation is Server or Client. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Kevin Fairclough replied on Monday, January 24, 2011</h2><p>I originally looked at this because my rule wasn&#39;t being executed when a child object&#39;s property changed. &nbsp;A scan of the forums lead me to believe I had to force the rule to run on the ChildChanged event. &nbsp;This event as I now know fires even when the object is loading via the factory also, so I need to conditionally force the rule on the ChildChanged to stop it running more than it should.</p>
<p>ApplicationContext.LogicalExecutionLocation to the rescue!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
