<P>We have an application that uses CSLA.1.4.0 under .Net1.1, now we want to convert this application from VS2003 to VS2005. What is the better csla version that I should use for .Net2.0, is Csla.1.5.2 or Csla1.5.3? We don't have too much time left for creating new csla2.0 business objects and&nbsp;I know this&nbsp;should be&nbsp;the best solution but we can not do it now. We just want our application would run under .Net2.0. Does anyone do this before? any suggestions?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thank you!</P>

<P>I am not sure we even re-compiled CSLA 1.x first. May have just used the existing .dlls.</P>
<P>This way I can transition to CSLA 2.0 when I find more time.</P>
<P>You have to change the Namespace in either 1.x or 2.0 though to avoid conflicts.</P>
<P>I found it easier to change it in 2.0 to Csla2 in the Project. So my one .dll file is named Csla2.dll.</P>
<P>Everything works.</P>
<P>I modified my custom Principal to use Csla2 and 1.x.</P>
<P>If you want to do remoting you have to set up 2 separate endpoints in your config file. </P>
