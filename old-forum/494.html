<P><SPAN>If you are having this problem while building your VS.NET 2005 project in Release mode here is the solution: <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Go to the project properties. Click on the build tab and set the value of the&nbsp;"Generate Serialization Assembly" dropdown to Off.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>P.S. If you wonder for what is this sgen.exe here is explanation from the msdn: "The XML Serializer Generator creates an XML serialization assembly for types in a specified assembly in order to improve the startup performance of a XmlSerializer when it serializes or deserializes objects of the specified types."</SPAN></P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><SPAN>The problem went away as promised.&nbsp; Any reason for concern?</SPAN></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 28, 2006</h2><P>Hmm. I don't see this error. I just rebuilt my current code (basically 2.0.2) in release mode, using VS, and see no errors in the output window or error list.</P>
<P>The only place where serialization assemblies could/should be created would be for the web services data portal channel. There's no where else in the framework that the XmlSerializer is used or is even valuable really.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Thursday, June 29, 2006</h2><P>Just went back and re-tested.</P>

<P>I hadn't done anything with Csla on this box before, I had been working with it on two other machines with no problems.&nbsp; Then again, I had only worked with Debug mode before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll try the same thing at home and report whether the same situation exists on my "main" machine for csla dev, or whether it's localized to my virtual pc at work.&nbsp; </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Professor Rotwang replied on Thursday, May 10, 2007</h2><span id="ctl00_ctl01_bcr_Deletepost1___Span1"> David, did you ever get
to the bottom of this? I'm getting the same error when trying to build
the latest VB version of CSLA (2.1.4) in VMWare 5.5.3 (Win XP SP2 guest
and host, VS 2005 SP1 Team Developer). I've narrowed it down to using
VM shared folders as the location for the project files - if I copy
them to the guest OS's C: drive then it builds fine - so obviously a
problem with VMWare and not CSLA. However, I have always used shared
folders for my other projects, but then they do not include web
services and such fancy stuff - still a noob when it comes to .NET let
alone CSLA!<br><br>I don't think that the setting </span><strong>"Generate Serialization Assembly" </strong><span id="ctl00_ctl01_bcr_Deletepost1___Span1">is available in VB. I just wondered if you found another brilliantly simple solution

<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Professor Rotwang replied on Friday, May 11, 2007</h2>Thanks for replying. I think there is a latency issue with the shared folders in VM - it is almost as if the built files are not available to the sgen utility, but they are there when I look at them afterwards. I'll try the vmware support forums, or just not use shared folders. They are really useful though for sharing projects across various VMs and allowing me to copy them to other locations without starting VM. <br>Thanks again.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
