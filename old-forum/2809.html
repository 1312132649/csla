<P>Is this a common problem people have come across?&nbsp; Also.... do I need to really upgrade my CSLA implementation to the latest and greatest?</P>
<P>Thanks for any and all feedback</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, May 02, 2007</h2>If you're using .Net 1.x, then you should probably be at Csla 1.53.&nbsp; I believe thats the last version for that version of the framework.&nbsp; I always prefer to keep up to date with Csla releases, but depending on the version you're using now, moving up may require some work as there are a few breaking changes.<br><br>If you overrode IsValid and IsDirty for the parent, your setup should be working fine.&nbsp; (Csla 2 has an IsSavable property, which is simply IsValid &amp;&amp; IsDirty).&nbsp; I would check to make sure your child's state is really what you think it is, and trace into the IsDirty and IsValid of the parent and child.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
