<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have constructed several business objects similar to the design of the ProjectTraker example. I am now trying to get an XML representation of the created objects and I am running through some issues.</P>
<P>Since XMLSerializer only serializes public fields or properties - what can I do with the read only type objects (although they all have&nbsp;public properties&nbsp;that implement get functionality the XMLSerializer will only serialize properties implementing both get and set)?</P>
<P>I&nbsp;also added an empty constructor to<FONT color=#000000> </FONT><FONT color=#2b91af><FONT color=#000000>NameValueListBase in order for the&nbsp;inherited&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;NameValueListBase objects.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Any insights?</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>FWIW, you could look at implementing the IXmlSerializable interface - it's designed to customize how .NET's XML serializers work with your objects.&nbsp; But that's a bit of work, and depending on what you need the XML for, I wouldn't necessarily recommend that approach.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>CSLA objects don't necessarily play well with .NET's XML serializers, which is one of many reasons why Rocky suggests an alternate approach when discussing web services.</FONT></P>
