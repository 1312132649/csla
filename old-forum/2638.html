<P>I justed to see what the consensus was for creating flowcharts&nbsp;of my code. The application is becoming more complex and I need to create flowcharts to keep track of things. So I was wondering how people have handled this in the past. Also if there's some good books I can use as reference to get consistancy. (its been a while since I've looked at such things)</P>
<P>Thanks for any suggestions made.</P>

What I like about this book is that the authors take a pragmatic view towards modeling where UML is a means to an end, as opposed to some other books I read where 'perfect' UML was the goal in itself.<br><br>Although UML will help you in describing your software, it will of course not address the fact that your software is still getting more and more complex. ;-) To keep things maintainable you might 'grow' your code into a more modularized architecture perhaps (e.g. separate assemblies)?<br><br>Regards,<br>Bayu<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
