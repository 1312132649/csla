<p>in my first(!) real SL-app (so, no MVVM or other &#39;must haves&#39; ;-))&nbsp;now the time has come to load several collections(in fact inheriting from NameValueListBase) to fill some comboboxes.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a little confused how to do that in a correct way. With only one collection I pass a method to fill into an app-wide-property (since it&#39;s used more than once) as the callback. But what with more than one collection? Isn&#39;t there a prob with several, maybe overlapping db-fetches (made by ADO.net)? In good ol&#39; windows times I wrapped that all into one method that was executed via a backgroundworker in a serial manner.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m just not seeing the wood for the trees?</p>
<p>Thanks for any input</p>

<p>as always, a direct hit ;-) I really appreciate your answer.</p>
<p>Maybe I should read the ebook first. If there wouldn&#39;t be that timeframe...</p>
<p>Thanks a lot and best wishes</p>
