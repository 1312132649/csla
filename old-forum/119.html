<P>Option #1 is good, however, if I'm using this other object within the containing object - in which case maintaining a reference is a fine thing. But then you need to realize that you've assumed control for that object's lifetime to some degree - in that the object instance will stay around as long as your containing object stays around.</P>
<P>If you do #1, make sure to make it as [NonSerialized] as well, because you probably don't want this (presumably root) object moving around the network with your object - that could get a bit messy (unless you plan for it).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
