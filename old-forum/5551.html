<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>RunLocal does one very simple thing, it causes the data portal to invoke the DataPortal_XYZ method without going across the network. </P>
<P>If the current machine is not configured to use a remote data portal (and your server would be configured in local mode by definition) then RunLocal would have no impact at all.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Wbmstrmjb replied on Wednesday, October 08, 2008</h2><P>Thank you for the clarification.&nbsp; I somehow figured that instantiating a BO on the remote server would try to also remote (but to where) and cause either a performance drop or an error.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
