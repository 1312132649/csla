<p>I have a project that is using CSLA 3.02.</p>
<p>I have a BLB object that has child items that have an IsDefault property.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When a child object has its IsDefault property set to true, I want to set the other child members IsDefault property to false.</p>
<p>I am calling the OnPropertyChanged(&quot;IsDefault&quot;) in the setter and I have that raising the Collections ListChanged event.&nbsp; However, the sender of the event is the Collection object, not the child object that raised the event.&nbsp; Nor is the child item in the ListChangedEventArgs (e).</p>
<p>How do I get a reference to the specific child instance that raised the event?</p>
<p>Or should I be doing this some other way?</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>In later versions of CSLA we implemented ChildChanged events to provide richer information about changes to child objects/collections.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, December 08, 2013</h2><p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would implement this type of logic in an override of the OnListChanged method in the list or attach an event handler to the list.</p>
<p>ListChangedEventArgs provide a property NewIndex which is the index to the item that was changed (or added) in the list. <br />So you can use this index to get the actual child item that was changed.&nbsp;</p>
