<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to do is to create another ReadOnlyList(I am assuming you just need to show the codes) say KPICodeInfoList and KPICodeInfo.</P>
<P>KPICodeInfoList will have a static GetMethod to which pass the primary key value of the selected KPI say KPI.SomeID.The KPICodeInfo class will just have the constructor and properties that makes up the KPIcode.</P>
<P>KPICodeInfoList list = KPICodeInfoList.Get(KPI.SomeID);</P>
<P>Iterate through the list to show all the info classes in that list.</P>
<P>HTH,</P>
