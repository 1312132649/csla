I am trying to implement an VS style error list in my application that will hold all the errors, warnings, and&nbsp;messages that&nbsp;need&nbsp;to be addressed in my app. This collection&nbsp;would hold all the broken rules in the object graph as well as other&nbsp;errors that happen in the application, not necessarily tied to a BO.&nbsp;I was thinking of inheriting from the&nbsp;brokenrule and brokenrulecollecion but that isn't possible. The reason I was inheriting was to add a delegate property to the brokenrule class. This&nbsp;delegate would&nbsp;be triggered by someone clicking on the&nbsp;error in my error list&nbsp;in order to do some custom action to resolve the error. Is there a better way to do this? I was looking&nbsp;for&nbsp;a good way to utilize the existing broken rule functionality without having to roll my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 22, 2008</h2>There is a treeview control to display all that infomation on CSLAcontrib - Andres built and contributed it a while back. Even if it isn't directly useful to you, it might give you some ideas.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JohnB replied on Friday, February 22, 2008</h2>We actually did what you've talking about. We created our own 
BrokenRulesCollection modeled from Csla that allows us to retrieve all broken rules 
for the parent object and any children easily. In our subclass of BusinessBase, we 
Overrode the BrokeRulesCollection property to use ours and by hooking into the Csla 
events we were able to implement the functionality you describe.<br><br>The 
solution we came up with works great and gives us the flexibility we need to 
manage the broken rules collection like we want.<br><br>HTH,<br>John</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sbrickler replied on Friday, February 22, 2008</h2><P>Thanks John, Is this something you can share with me? If not, I understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few code snippets would help though.</P>
<P>Thanks again.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
