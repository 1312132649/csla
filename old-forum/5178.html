There are other children also but this where i have doubt</P>
<P>EditableRootParent&nbsp; =&gt; Editable Child List&nbsp; =&gt; Editable Child</P>
<P>List is binded with Grid View on screen where user can configure (change/Add/Deelte) information. For the list i need to show Add and Delete button which works as:</P>
<P><STRONG>Add button:</STRONG> When user clicks on Add button it should add&nbsp;blank record at the end of the grid. User can click Add button multiple times and i need to add as many rows without inserting records actually in database table.</P>
<P><STRONG>Delete&nbsp;button:</STRONG> When user clicks on&nbsp;Delete button it should remove last rwo&nbsp;from the grid. Again user can click multiple times on Delete button to remove multiple records but not from database table.</P>
<P>Finally we have Save button. I need to save all this information in database when this is called. Can anyone point me in right direction to implement this.</P>
<P>Env used : VS 2008, CSLA 3.0</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Lalit replied on Thursday, July 31, 2008</h2><P>Hi Vijay,</P>
<P>I think you should invest some of your time to look into the ProjectTracker example first. That will provide you all answers related to implementation of parent-child relationship. Only after that it will be meaningful to discuss things here.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Thursday, July 31, 2008</h2><P>You can actually do what you are trying with a BusinessListBase (BLB) derived class, not EditableRootListBase (ERLB)&nbsp;-- BLB doesn't try to persist any changes to the data store automatically, and you can save all changes made to the list in a single method invocation and database transaction.</P>
<P>You'll find that at least the default implementation ERLB is more aggressive about saving each object separately. </P>
<P>You could also override the Save() implementation of our ERLB to override the default behavior and defer saving/updating the objects to a later method that traverses the list and saves the modified or new objects directly. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
