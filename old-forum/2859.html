We also allow IDs to be grouped (by Client, Date...) in the form. For filling the tree, we use Readonlylistbase and readonlybase classes. We have incorporated one Parent property in the class - which we use for grouping. </P>
<P>Is there anything more flexible...so that grouping can be done dynamically...or it will support multiple levels of grouping (say, clients &gt; date &gt; orders)?</P>
