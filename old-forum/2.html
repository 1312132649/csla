		<p>A weblog (blog) is an online journal you can use to share thoughts, ideas, gripes, project status, or anything else you want. Blogs allow you to be a contributor rather than just a bystander.</p>
		<p>Postings are arranged chronologically and can be categorized depending upon how the administrator has configured the system. You can view a post by clicking on the title from the home page where all users' posts are collectively shown. Once viewing a blog you can read other posts by that person or provide comments on postings.</p>
		<p>Creating new posts is quick and easy. If you have the ability to post you should see a link (usually on the left) on your weblog's home page: new post. Clicking on this link takes you into your blogs administration pages for creating new posts.</p>
		<p>If you don't have the ability to post, contact the site administrator and ask for your own blog.</p>
		<p>Happy Blogging!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
