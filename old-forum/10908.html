<p>I&#39;ve compared the source between 4.1 and 4.2, and it seems related to the way the user it stored in the ApplicationContextManager. I&#39;m performing authentication on a background thread to avoid freezing the UI and since the user is set to Thread.CurrentPrincipal, it gets lost in the process...</p>
<p>Is there a workaround for this problem?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 22, 2011</h2><p>A WPF application <em>must</em> reference Csla.Xaml.dll so the correct ApplicationContext.User provider is used. WPF requires special of the principal, and that special handling is implemented in a provider that is in that assembly.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>poulin_julien replied on Wednesday, November 23, 2011</h2><p>Thank you for your help.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
