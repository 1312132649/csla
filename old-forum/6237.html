<P>Just wondering if the original VB6 source for CSLA is anywhere. I have a client who has a whole load of VB6 applications that are still in use. This is not unusual in the industry. Instead of embarking on a massive CSLA.NET rewrite, they would like to upskill their developers via an interim VB6 CSLA. </P>
<P>Any info, greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>Regards,</P>
<P>Sean.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, January 22, 2009</h2><P>Here's a link to what info I have online, including a link to the original code</P>

<P>Unfortunately I lost the code for the VB6 Distributed Objects book, and so I can't provide that.</P>
<P>If anyone does have that code, please send it to me and I'll put it on my site. Every now and then someone does request the VB6 code, and there were a flurry of requests last Nov/Dec.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SeanD replied on Thursday, January 22, 2009</h2><P>Thanks for that, Rocky. It's nice to reminisce over the old days with a nostalgic stroll through VB6 Objects. Ah, life was so much simpler then....</P>
<P>Thanks again,</P>
<P>Sean</P>
