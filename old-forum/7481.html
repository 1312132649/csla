Is there a simple way to do this?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Thursday, August 20, 2009</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>There really isn't a good way to do this.&nbsp; IIRC, this has been asked a few times on the forum, and I don't remember seeing any real good suggestions.&nbsp; If your DP is running locally, you could create an event aggregator that your UI and BO's could talk to (and I would definitely use one, to help keep this stuff loosely coupled.)&nbsp; But I wouldn't necessarily consider that a good idea,&nbsp;primarily because&nbsp;it won't work if/when you go to a remote DP.&nbsp; Once you start writing code like that, you begin to lose one of the benefits of CSLA - location independence.</FONT></P>

With a progressbar, we can show progress and they'll understand that something is actually happening. <br><br>I suppose I could fetch a count first and warn them if it exceeds a certain threshold.<br><br>Barry<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Thursday, August 20, 2009</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>You could certainly do a fetch, though that's obviously going to be one more touch to the database.&nbsp; It's not a big one, but in a remote-DP environment, you may notice&nbsp;the delay.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I'd also consider my "busy animation" suggestion.&nbsp; You could leverage your progressbar idea and use an "indeterminate progress bar" - one that increments based on a time interval rather than actual progress.&nbsp; I know that probably none of&nbsp;us are fans of those (thank you, Microsoft installs), but it&nbsp;does have its uses if handled correctly.&nbsp; I find the "cylon marquee" style works OK in this case.&nbsp; Or you can use one of the many animations available - depending on your version of CSLA and UI technology, there's one in&nbsp;CSLA you could probably leverage.&nbsp; Basically, anything that moves is going to be better than just a static hourglass, and you won't have to hit the database twice.</FONT></P>

I might be able to share this into the CslaContrib project if it is of interest.<br>&nbsp;<br>/jonnybee&nbsp; <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
