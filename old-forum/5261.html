<P>I want to add a child object(Address) to the EditableChildCollection (Addresses)&nbsp;from the UI but the example code (pg 385-387 C# VS2005) seems to indicate that the child object should be added to the collection through the EditableRoot (Customer)&nbsp;object.&nbsp; This makes sense, especially if the child object in teh collection is going to have a parentid from the EditableRoot.</P>
<P>In the past I've changed the code somewhat and made it so I could create the child objects on their own, populate them with data, and then add them to the child collection - however, this time around I'm trying to follow the CSLA design more closely than I ever have before. (Good way to learn).</P>
<P>So how do you guys handle this - for some reason it looks odd to me - but would you have a method like Customer.NewAddress()?&nbsp;&nbsp; That seems "odd" to me since I'd expect to write Addresses.NewAddress() or even more naturally, Address.NewAddress().&nbsp;</P>
<P>So if you were going to create a new Address object which would (after editing) be added&nbsp;to the Addresses collection of a Customer object which one would you use?</P>
<P>Customer.NewAddress()</P>
<P>Addresses.NewAddress()</P>
<P>Address.NewAddress()</P>
