<p>The web UI is updated, and outbound email should be working.</p>
<p>What is not working, is inbound email. <b>At the moment you can not send email to the forum.</b></p>
<p>We&#39;re working on the inbound email issue, but it may take a few days to resolve. Please be patient and enjoy the new web UI in the meantime :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, February 08, 2010</h2><p>Thanks for doing the upgrade!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Need to get used to the new layout, but looks good (and it works in IE8 again!)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Tuesday, February 09, 2010</h2><p>wow, this looks so much more promising <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /><br />Thanks for the update!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Tuesday, February 09, 2010</h2><p>What happened here!!!&nbsp; Just when I needed to look up the answer to one of my earlier posts, the site looks like an earthquake hit it.</p>
<p>I am sorry but the site now has the look of all those totally useless answer sites that you see when you google something, and find question after question that nobody appears to have the answer to&nbsp;- but they are all&nbsp;referenced on the first Google page.</p>
<p>Our site was different, it looked and felt different.&nbsp; You knew there&#39;ll be answers here.&nbsp; You could spend time here.&nbsp; I always had to tear myself away.&nbsp; Now it looks like the blizzard in Chicago - cold, impersonal and uninviting. </p>
<p>Oh! where has it all gone!<img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, February 09, 2010</h2><p>The forum is very stylable. If you&#39;d like to take up the task of restyling it I&#39;d surely welcome the help :)</p>
<p>The problem with the old version of the forum is that it didn&#39;t support modern browsers, had trouble pasting code, had a terrible search engine, had no way to recover passwords, no way to remove old/bad users, no spam filtering, an unreliable email subsystem (I had bat jobs running mutliple times a day to restart the email services), etc.</p>
<p>In short, the old version of the software was probably very good in 2004 or so, but after 6 years it was getting pretty unmanageable and would soon become unusable as browsers continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Other than visual style, all the content, posts and people are still here - it is the same forum and the same community.</p>
<p>The only thing we&#39;re missing at this point is inbound email. Sadly we were unable to get that feature working this past weekend due to a licensing issue, and I&#39;m still waiting to hear back from Telligent on how to resolve that...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Tuesday, February 09, 2010</h2><p>Okay.&nbsp; Now that I have worked with it for more than a minute, it is beginning to look a whole lot better.&nbsp; It is the same problem my wife has with me - I never let her throw anything away.&nbsp; I am okay now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hyperventilation has also subsided.&nbsp; I like the new site.<img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Wednesday, February 10, 2010</h2><p>I had an active subscription to the main forum &quot;CSLA .NET discussion&quot; and since the upgrade I stoped receiving emails. I suppose all subscription status was lost.

<p>Then click on the Forum Subscriptions link in the right side-bar.</p>
<p>That should get you to the list of forums defined on the server, with subscription status/links for each forum.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Wednesday, February 17, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b> </p>

<p>I did that before but wasn&#39;t receiving email. I re did it and now it&#39;s all right.</p>
<p>What I miss is the font/size/color handling in replies. I dont mean &quot;Quick Reply&quot; but the proper reply button like this one <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-11.gif" alt="Cool" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Peer replied on Thursday, February 18, 2010</h2><p>I have noticed that the &quot;points&quot; counter doesn&#39;t increase (probably for&nbsp;all members...).&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is not realy important to me BUT if I stay on a poor 160 points my whole life &nbsp;&nbsp;I never will be an expert. <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>
<p>Peer</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lukky replied on Friday, February 19, 2010</h2><p>There&#39;s one thing I&#39;d really like to see in the forum, if it can be done, is to have &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; navigation links at the bottom as well as at the top.</p>
<p>I find it annoying having to scroll back to the top each time just to get back to the discussion list (and yes, I know I could use the back button, but doing so doesn&#39;t refresh the read/unread status of the various threads).</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bniemyjski replied on Friday, February 19, 2010</h2><p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>It is possible to have the bread crumbs at the bottom but one would need to manually edit the theme. Also the points are disabled due to the changes in licensing.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Friday, February 19, 2010</h2><p>I think that one&nbsp;helpful&nbsp;feature that would be nice to have would be to force the original poster to select what edition/version of the CSLA they are using before they can post.</p>
<p>Is that easily&nbsp;doable?</p>
