<p>I have a Parent-Child where I want the child to have a reference to a delegate on the parent. ie CanWriteProperty(). &nbsp;Basically I need the parent to decide whether the child is editable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is ok by passing a reference from the parent to the child during Create/Fetch however as this is built up on the .server, what will happen when it gets passed to the Silverlight application from WCF.</p>
<p>My initial thoughts are that I would have to have a managed property to hold that delegate or alternatively on the client I would have to recurse the structure re-creating the link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any thoughts/suggestions on a better approach.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Parent - Child - GrandChild.... (each determining its editable status via root node)</p>
<p>Plus I&#39;m trying to achieve loose coupling between my objects</p>
<p>The property on the parent will be my fallback :)</p>
