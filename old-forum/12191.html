You can look at the many other resource files that have been translated to see how this works.</p>
<p>Then you can send me the resulting file, or issue a pull request in GitHub., or post it here on the forum.</p>
<p>Thank you for adding a language to the framework!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
