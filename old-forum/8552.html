<p>But you should know that LINQ to CSLA is undergoing a rethink in CSLA 4, so it won&#39;t work the same. Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indexing is removed completely - external tools like i4o do this better and with less disruption to CSLA code.</li>
<li>Getting a synched list (LinqObservableCollection or LinqBindingList) will be an explicit step, not automatic as in 3.8</li>
</ul>
<p>In SL the only class will be LinqObservableCollection of course, because there is no BindingList concept in SL.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>am_fusion replied on Friday, February 19, 2010</h2><p>I am not so sure we will have the luxury of upgrading to CSLA 4.0 &#39;soon&#39;.&nbsp; I assume that, due to the changes in indexing, it will not be straight forward (read relatively painless) to port over to v3.8.x? &nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 19, 2010</h2><p>There&#39;ll actually be quite a few changes going from 3.8 to 4, as the major version number is changing.</p>
<p>If you use indexing there&#39;ll be some rework because you&#39;ll have to switch to using i4o or something like that. Few people use indexing, as it is such a narrowly useful feature, but if you do use it the impact is there.</p>
<p>Of course CSLA .NET for Silverlight doesn&#39;t have indexing either, so that is a non-issue when moving from 3.8 to 4.</p>
<p>Or to put it another way, people using SL will only benefit (in terms of LINQ) when moving from 3.8 to 4. It is .NET code that might employ indexing or synced lists that will be affected.</p>
<p>Once I have the LinqObservableCollection working in CSLA 4, you may be able to back-port it to 3.8. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m using any .NET 4 specific capabilities - it isn&#39;t like Microsoft has changed the way LINQ or ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt; work in any substantial way from .NET 3.5 to 4.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>am_fusion replied on Friday, February 19, 2010</h2><p>Sweet!!! that is good news.&nbsp; I am now thinking I will be keeping an eye on trunk and &#39;back port&#39; the LinqToObservableCollection when I get the time... no rush for you though, we have found a workaround we can use until then.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
