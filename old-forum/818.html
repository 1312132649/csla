It seems that the posts are just clumped together and you must weed your way through the versions.<br><br>BTW: I've just read the 2.0 book and find it very fascinating.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Friday, August 04, 2006</h2>This has been discussed a lot in the past and the consensus is that much of the functionality and design decisions are shared between the two versions.&nbsp; Many of the questions and answers would be applicable to both versions, and the forum has stayed as a single forum.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, August 04, 2006</h2>I gather that the next version of Community Server will have a type of tagging support, so that may provide a good way to tag each post with the version number of the framework (if any) relevant to the post.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>HankHill2 replied on Wednesday, August 09, 2006</h2>Guess I haven't read enough posts then.<br><br>It just seems that the changes from 1.x and 2.0 are significant enough to warrant separating the discussion. I know if I were working on 1.x and people kept talking about generics and other items that aren't supported in the framework, it would be annoying. I'm sure there are subtly differences that may not be understood or apparent right away when reading a post as well.<br><br>I'll make sure I read more posts before rehasing an old subject. Although sometimes it helps to bring things up again.<br><br>Thanks for your thoughts though.<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
