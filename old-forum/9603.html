<p>I&#39;ll give you an example, but it&#39;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>Instead of using a datagrid I actually wrote a routine that extends the label control, adds object data to the label.&nbsp; In&nbsp;some cases hundreds of those labels are drawn out in a panel that makes it look like a datagrid.&nbsp; I did this so I could color code cells based upon values.&nbsp; It&#39;s a total&nbsp;nightmare.&nbsp; It means the form cannot be resized - I should be flipping hamburgers for that mess.</p>
<p>Any ways, any time I get discouraged I view the way I used to do things with how I do them now and the fact is I&#39;ve made significant progress.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking forward to the improvements coming with MVVM, 4.0 and so on.&nbsp; I hope to rewrite that application using all the new things I&#39;ve learned.</p>
<p>Good times.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, October 05, 2010</h2><p>I think we all have that experience on a regular basis. Look at anything you wrote from from 6-12 months ago and all the flaws are glaringly obvious <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>griff replied on Wednesday, October 06, 2010</h2><p>Your not alone. &nbsp;After twenty years of programming every new development is, I hope, better coded.....but it still begs the question of why the last development, say only 6-12 months ago, still has its foibles. &nbsp;</p>
