<P>The CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series is an invaluable resource for getting started with CSLA .NET on the Silverlight platform. The series starts with the basics of setting up a Silverlight solution, covers the creation of client-only applications using CSLA .NET and then moves to a discussion of creating 2-, 3- and 4-tier applications using CSLA .NET on the client and on the server(s).</P>
<P>Segments 5 and 6 cover CSLA .NET object stereotypes and data access respectively. These segments are also available for <A href="http://store.lhotka.net/"><FONT color=#669966>purchase as individual videos</FONT></A>, because they are useful to any CSLA .NET developer, including ASP.NET, WPF, Windows Forms and more.</P>
<P>Segment 7 covers the use of Windows authentication, MembershipProvider authentication and custom authentication using CSLA .NET for Silverlight against an ASP.NET web or application server. It also covers the use of per-property and per-type authorization in business classes, and talks about how the PropertyStatus, ObjectStatus and CslaDataProvider controls interact with those rules.</P>
