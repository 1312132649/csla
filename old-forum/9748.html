<p>When you save an object, it is common to set the ID value to another value based on something coming back from the database; and the IsNew, IsDirty flags on either the root or child objects are often changed as well. Should an error occur somewhere, these values are obviously not correct anymore (because the save failed). By returning a new object, if an exception occurs you can essential pretend that nothing happened, because your object is in the exact state is was before.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, November 11, 2010</h2><p>Marjon is correct. There&#39;s a very good discussion of this in Chapters 1 and 2 of <em>Expert 2008 Business Objects.</em></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
