<p>The WPF application (to be written) would be deployed to C:\Program Files using a Setup project and installed while the TS is in install mode. All the users will use the exe and dlls from the same C:\Program Files dir.<br /><br />I&#39;ll have to install .Net 4, which I assume won&#39;t be a problem, but I am just a bit worried about Reflection. Every logged in User will have their own virtual environment, but just thought I&#39;d ask if anyone has used CSLA on TS.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

WPF will work on TS2003 but TS2008 and later is better optimized for WPF rendering. I know we have significant improvements running our WPF app on RDP 7.0.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
