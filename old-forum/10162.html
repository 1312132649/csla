<p>Yesterday I bought the &quot;Creating business objects&quot; book. There is no treatment for the &quot;timestamp property&quot;, Will it be in the Data Access book?</p>
<p>In the sample code I saw the &quot;timestamp property&quot; was treated like a managed backing field? Could somebody explain me why it canged from private to managed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Yes, I could have overridden OnGetState and OnSetState to serialize a private backing field, but I think it is simpler to use a managed backing field so CSLA does the work for me and my business classes don&#39;t end up cluttered with serialization code.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lazaroms replied on Monday, March 14, 2011</h2><p>Thanks Rocky</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
