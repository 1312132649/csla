Then continue with making a change in the "Description" field:<br>

As you can see the height of the rows revert back to original height.<br><br>
Is there a simple way to avoid this?<br><br>This is may seem like a minor issue, and it certainly is for the Project Tracker program. But in our program we display product pictures inn the grid allowing the user to adjust the height of the rows to see a larger picture. And to make things worse, when the user edits the amount fields in the rows, a total amount field inn the order header is also updated causing the grid to flicker while the user edits fields in the grid.<br><br>Any pointers to the right direction to solve the problem or comments is much appreciated.<br><br>Wilfred<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JohnB replied on Wednesday, February 13, 2008</h2>We are using the controls from DevExpress and have not come across this type of issue. I know from using the DevExpress controls, like many of the other third-party controls, there are literally hundreds of properties you can configure for a very granular control.<br><br>As for a solution, I would suggest that you look at what type of interaction you're trying to provide in the grid. I know that we did plenty of prototyping using the standard Microsoft controls and did not have any real issues.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br>John<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, February 13, 2008</h2>I'm not sure how to solve your particular problem, but I think the post title is misleading; this likely has nothing to do with Csla.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>wilfreds replied on Wednesday, February 13, 2008</h2>Thank you John for your reply. I may have to look for a third party grid control. But I was hoping I did not have to do that.<br><br>ajj3085, thank you for the comment. Sorry if the title is misleading, I just dont know. I have made no modifications to Rockys code so the behavior should be easy to reproduce for everyone. Please let me know if thats not the case. Do you think the problem is the DataGridView?<br><br>Wilfred<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
