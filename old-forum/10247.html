<p>I have a specific requirement where i need to be able to set a ComboBox&#39;s entry If its underlying bound property is a required field, but only if the bound ItemsSource returns a collection containing one value.</p>
<p>The ItemsSource is bound to the model property of a Lookup style csla ViewModel (fetched Asynch) and the ComboBox needs to have this one item set as its selectedItem (or set SelectedIndex to 0).</p>
<p>As yet, Ive been unable to think of a solution to this, so any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
