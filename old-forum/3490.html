<P>There is a sample wpf app to give you a start.&nbsp; Rocky is currently writing an ebook that would give you further details.&nbsp; Last I heard, this ebook should be ready around the end of this month.</P>

<P>Dependency properties are artifacts of WPF and WF - both of which are interface layer technologies (from a CSLA perspective).</P>
<P>WPF binds to business objects directly - no need for DPs.</P>
<P>WF binds to DPs, but you should never expose a business object as a public property of an activity/workflow, and so there too it is a non-issue.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
