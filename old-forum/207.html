When I add the Private Criteria class,&nbsp;I get the following error:&nbsp;"class 'Criteria' conflicts with class 'Criteria' in the base class 'NameValueListBase' and should be declared&nbsp; Shadows'." The compiler likes it when I add Shadows to the declaration, but then the code doesn't work at run-time. I'm working around this by passing the filter value into the Shared function which returns the list (which then stores the filter value in a Shared variable), but that seems inelegant and against the 'spirit' of CSLA. I'd be much obliged if somebody could tell me what I'm missing.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, May 26, 2006</h2>Just use another name for your criteria class - like FilteredCriteria. That way you avoid the naming collision and it should work just fine.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Norma_B replied on Friday, May 26, 2006</h2><P>*ahem* d'oh!</P>
