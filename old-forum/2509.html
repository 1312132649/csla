<P>This may just be a Rocky question, but we are utilizing the CSLA CodeSmith templates (RC1.1.0) with CSLA 2.1.4 to generate our core objects.&nbsp; One of the challenges we have is whenever&nbsp;the generated code attempts to load a root object from list (whether editable or read only), it does so utilizing a call get Get&lt;BusinessObject&gt;(SafeDataReader dr) - the issue is that this method does not exist (e.g. is not generated with the templates)!</P>
<P>Therefore, my question is this:&nbsp;&nbsp;should we&nbsp;modify the templates to include this method for root objects, or is there a good reason that the framework omits this?&nbsp; We want to be certain we adhere as close to the core of the framework as possible.</P>
<P>Disclaimer:&nbsp; I have not traversed every chapter in the book; thus, I may be asking a very silly question here.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, March 12, 2007</h2>I think the templates are meant to be a jumping off point.&nbsp; Certainly I would think you could modify them as you need.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>noyceb replied on Monday, March 12, 2007</h2>Definately agree.&nbsp; However, my question is more from a framework perspective...Is there a good reason that this construction method was (or should be) omitted?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, March 12, 2007</h2>Why is that method not in the framework?&nbsp; Probably because its not safe to assume everyone is loading form SafeDataReader.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>noyceb replied on Monday, March 12, 2007</h2><P>I intended this question to be more along the lines of "is there any reason according to the framework&nbsp;that a root object should be treated differently than that of a child object when dealing with lists?"; I never really cared about the data source subject - my bad for including it in the post.&nbsp; I think the overall answer here is the usual "yes and no; it depends on your implementation" - I was hoping instead that the framework would provide some hard-line&nbsp;guidance in this matter.</P>
<P>Thanks for your posts.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, March 13, 2007</h2><P>Page 87 of the eBook is titled:</P><B><FONT face=Arial size=4>
<P>Altering the EditableRoot Template</P></B></FONT>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This change is required to support a new type of BO named:<B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4></P>
<P>EditableRootListBase</P></B></I></FONT>
<P>If you don't plan to use ERL then you do not need to modify the ER template.</P>
<P>So if you want to modify the template you should make it conditional - SupportsERL (T/F).</P>
