An article on MSDN seems to indicate that this is a sometimes issue with generics. Has anyone noticed this? I can see it in my Variables window in VisualStudio - the collection object has "Count = System.TypeLoadException" in the value column.</P>
<P>As of right now, I'm not sure it this is hurting anything - so I'm just asking if anyone has noticed this, is it important, etc, etc.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>phowatt replied on Tuesday, March 20, 2007</h2>Yes, I get the same thing but it has never been a problem as I have learned to ignore it. It shows up when I hover over a collection. I wish this message did not display as seems to be an eroneous message.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>IraD replied on Tuesday, March 20, 2007</h2><P>I have just found the post at </P>
