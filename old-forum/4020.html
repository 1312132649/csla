I bind the rootlist to a DataGridView and all the CRUD functions work OK. The problem is when the user starts to enter a new record and part way through changes his mind and hits ESC. The binding mechanism throws an index out of range error and "Index 7 does not have a value".</P>
<P>I downloaded CSLA 3.1 and tried it with VS2008 to see if the problem had evaporated but it hasn't. The Guide to CSLA 3.1 has some strictures on databinding that I think bear on the problem but I can't quite see how.</P>
<P>Any ideas please?</P>
