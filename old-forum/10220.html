<p>CSLA\core\trunk\Source\Csla.Silverlight.test\ChildGrandChild</p>
<p>I worked through a number of issues, including upgrading it to VS2010/.NET4. &nbsp;There appear to be files missing from SVN however, including WcfPortal.svc which is referenced during application startup in App.xaml.cs in the&nbsp;Application_Startup method.</p>
<p>I could probably continue to hack away and try to get this working, but it&#39;s not quite the scenario I need, so I thought I would just report the issues instead.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if issues like this are something I should report here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslabugs/bugs.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslabugs/bugs.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The FAQ here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/BugsandFeedback.ashx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/BugsandFeedback.ashx</a>&nbsp;implies that I should just report issues on the forum. &nbsp;When I tried clicking on &quot;add new issue&quot; in BugTracker.NET, I got an error page. &nbsp;I don&#39;t see a way to register a new user account on BugTracker.NET either.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 30, 2011</h2><p>I had bugtracker open to allow public bug reporting. Within a couple days it had hundreds of spam messages posted. Spammers are evil people.</p>
<p>So the only bug reporting mechanism right now is through the forum.</p>
<p>The test apps in the SL test folder haven&#39;t been updated recently, and could easily be disfunctional. I forgot to remove them from the repository, that&#39;s all...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
