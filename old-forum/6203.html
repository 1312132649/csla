It seems to be for Serialization (which since it's abstract I can't see how it helps).<br>The annoying thing is that you've put an Obsolete Attribute on it to encourage people not create a new instance through the constructor (which it can't).<br>But when you inherit from it you get a message telling you that the constructor is obsolete.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, January 20, 2009</h2>I'll add an item to the issue tracker to take a look at this, thanks.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
