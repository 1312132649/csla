Project started up on sourceforge as open source with a team of developers. Only one developer was working on it from long time.</P>
<P>Recently i came to know that it is available from following site :-</P>
<P><A href="http://groups.google.com/group/CslaGenerator/topics">http://groups.google.com/group/CslaGenerator/topics</A></P>
<P>Summary now is that project was declared as open source till today. All user feedback, advises, ideas were being taken, labelling the product as open source and product was getting polished gradually but it was being distributed without the source code.</P>
<P>What i understand that for open source projects all have the right&nbsp;to see the code and contribute their ideas and distributing open source projects without source code is illegal.</P>
<P>But this is what it is and on my multiple multiple request, result is that source code is not available and cannot be provided, Why ?? </P>
<P>Please have a look at detailed message exchange on these links :-</P>
