The business class is only firing the event once, so it appears to be Binding related. I am using CSLA 3.0.4.0.<br><br>Thanks<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curtmantle replied on Friday, January 16, 2009</h2>I have found the reason for this, and I'm happy to say it's not a problem with CSLA, but the idiot who programmed the form used as a base for all the forms in my app. That idiot being me!<br><br>I was inadvertently setting the PropertyChanged handler twice: ie -<font face="Courier New"> bo.PropertyChanged += </font>etc...<br><br>Doh!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
