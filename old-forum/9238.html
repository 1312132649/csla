<p>We are using CSLA 3.5.0.0 in our application and trying to run it using ASP.NET Web Development Server. Desktop does not have admin rights so we can&#39;t use it in IIS. We are getting error in the class where we are referencing <b>Csla.Security.BusinessPrincipalBase.</b> I read it on book </p>
<p>(http://books.google.com/books?id=9Mbx3Svoc1EC&amp;pg=PA705&amp;lpg=PA705&amp;dq=csla+custom+security+object+limitation+with+asp.net+web+development+server&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=do6mTT2Zzv&amp;sig=aKjqa2a7yi4KoAm4RR741c5o1i4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nTI8TKCEDIGdlgf4soj9BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)</p>
<p>that some components of CSLA can not be used with ASP.NET Web Development Server. I wanted to confirm whether <b>Csla.Security.BusinessPrincipalBase </b>can be used on ASP.NET Web Development Server?<b><br /></b></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 21, 2010</h2><p>No, absolutely not. BusinessPrincipalBase is not part of .NET, so it us a custom principal, and the dev server can&#39;t handle it (easily).</p>
<p>Only GenericPrincipal and WindowsPrincipal will work, and CSLA 3.5 doesn&#39;t support GenericPrincipal.</p>
<p>This is one reason Microsoft has (finally) abandoned the dev server in favor of a <i>new</i> dev server that is compatible with IIS7 (see Scott Guthrie&#39;s recent blog posts on the topic).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vijay replied on Tuesday, July 27, 2010</h2><p>Can this be used when application is hosted on IIS with virtual directory or we need to create Web Site only to run our application. Please note we are using IIS 5.1.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 27, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;this&quot;.</p>
<p>Cassini (the ASP.NET Dev Web Server) doesn&#39;t behave exactly like any version of IIS, and one of its quirks is that it doesn&#39;t work to run apps that use a custom principal. This isn&#39;t a CSLA issue, it is a broad issue with that web server.</p>
<p>So if you have a custom principal in your app, you need to host in IIS to do your development and testing. Any version of IIS that works with .NET should work fine.</p>
<p>It <i>might be the case</i> that this new dev server tool will allow you to do your development and testing without IIS. I don&#39;t know, as I haven&#39;t had time to try it out yet.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
