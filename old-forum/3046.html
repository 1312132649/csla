<P>I have one form in my app that is setup&nbsp;for dataentry, and the operator get quite annoyed by field by field validation. So I want to implement validation on save with a dialog of the errors.</P>
<P>So I'm wonder how I would go about this with csla?</P>
<P>Also how do I disable the Save button until some data is changed?</P>
<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, June 17, 2007</h2><P>This article shows how to bind to IsDirty/IsValid/etc.</P>

<P>To do your validation at save time instead of per-field, just don't put an ErrorProvider control on your form (that eliminates per-field notification) and add a bit of code behind your save button click handler to see if the object is valid. If not, use the broken rules collection to build your error dialog.</P>
<P>I do exactly this in the PTWeb code - look at the ProjectEdit page for example.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Monday, June 18, 2007</h2>Thank you Rock, I appreciate your time.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
