<P>The Sort used the property DLLine, Ascending</P>
<P>When I add to the BusinessListBase, then item is added at the end of the SortedBindingList which I can see by debugging a for loop over the SortedBindingList. The item has a DLLine value that is less than the first item in the sort and in this case should be placed at the beginning.</P>
<P>If I do an ApplySort straight after I add the item then its is placed in the correct place.</P>
<P>This doesn't seem right to me as I would expect the SortedBindingList to remain sorted.</P>
