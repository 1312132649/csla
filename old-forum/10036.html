<p>I&#39;ve read some past posts of you where you&#39;re wondering to deprecate ProjecTracker. Instead, you recommend the SimpleNTier solution.</p>
<p>I&#39;m follower of ProjectTracker from the very beginning and I find it simple (yes, I&#39;m not a genius) but useful. What are finally your plans?</p>
<p>Long live for ProjectTracker!</p>

<p>In agreement - Long Live the ProjectTracker sample application!</p>

<p>It has not proven to be a good example for the first four ebooks in the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series. I do expect it to be useful in the last three books though, where I talk about specific implementations for Silverlight/WPF, ASP.NET MVC, and WP7.</p>
<p>That implies that I&#39;ll update the sample for those four UI technologies starting around the end of February or early March when I start on those last 3 ebooks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
