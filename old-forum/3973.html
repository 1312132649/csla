<P>I'm using CodeSmith 2.6 to do my code generation and it works perfectly fine. But it's no longer in active development and uses .net v1.1. So I thought I would look for an open source alternative, and I found MyGeneration and IrisGenerator (still in alpha but looks promising).</P>
<P>Does any one know of a good tutorial?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Sunday, December 02, 2007</h2><P>Codesmith is still very active.</P>
<P>It is just not free anymore.</P>
<P>I have version 4 and it is up to speed with .Net 2.0.</P>

I'm the only one here that uses dot net, the others are still using vb6 and hand coding.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
