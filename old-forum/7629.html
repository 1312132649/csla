I have it running locally (no wcf) but wanted to see how it works with WCF. So I setup the WCFHost project to point to the MDF files provided and am hosting WCFHost in IIS 7.0 under Vista-64. I can access the service via the browser just fine. I configured the PTWin app.config to point to that IIS Hosted WCFHost and I get that error shows in the subject. Here is a little snippet: <br />See the end of this message for details on invoking <br />just-in-time (JIT) debugging instead of this dialog box.<br /><br />************** Exception Text **************<br />Csla.DataPortalException: DataPortal.Fetch failed (An attempt to attach an auto-named database for file C:\Users\Me\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\ProjectTrackercs\Security.mdf failed. A database with the same name exists, or specified file cannot be opened, or it is located on UNC share.) ---> Csla.Reflection.CallMethodException: DataPortal_Fetch method call failed ---> System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: An attempt to attach an auto-named database for file C:\Users\Me\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\ProjectTrackercs\Security.mdf failed. A database with the same name exists, or specified file cannot be opened, or it is located on UNC share.<br />etc...<br />I appreciate any help anyone can offer.  </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 15, 2009</h2><P>The exception is indicating that Security.mdf can't be found. I think the SQL Server Express exception could be better phrased, but that's a Microsoft thing obviously :)</P>
<P>You probably need to edit your app.config or web.config to have the correct path to the mdf file.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ludwigs3rd replied on Wednesday, September 16, 2009</h2>Thanks again for the advice Rocky, even for this trivial issue! :)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
