<P>I was suprised I didn't find anything in a search. In a Windows Forms app, how do you go about binding a property to one of several RadioButtons? My property is a string.</P>
<P>The only thing I would know how to do, which is not binding, &nbsp;is manually in the code, set the property when the checked value changes, and/or set the checked value when fetching an object.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

Logic in the setter for that control sets the appropriate radio button checked on and the getter returns a value depending on which radio button is on.<br><br>Now you have only one property to bind to and you haven't polluted your business object with something that's really a UI issue.<br><br>Making that property an enum can be a tidy way to go.<br><br>Cheers<br>Ross<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Wednesday, September 20, 2006</h2><P>Thanks Brian and Ross for the replies,</P>
<P>I realized that I wanted to bind a string to something that needs to be boolean, or one of several booleans. It makes good sense to not have the business object be responsible for UI behaviour, so I'm going to attempt the UserControl route.</P>
<P>Thanks again,</P>
