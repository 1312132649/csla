When u create a project for windows or asp.net u could use CSLA version 3.6 as your business framework for your business objects. It has his pros and cons, but as far as i know it has more pros then cons ;) Anyway, u don't integrate CSLA into Visual Studio 2008, u just inherit the base classes CSLA offers you. But i recommend buying the newest book for the 3.6 version.<br /><br />However, there are some generators integrating into visual studio like cslafactory, but he (or they) aren't putting in much effort yet. Google for codesmith if u want a generator. <br /><br />PS: No problem about your english..<br /><br />Greetings,<br />Raymond de Jong</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
