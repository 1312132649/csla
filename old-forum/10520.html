Owners of the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series have access to this early draft.</p>
<p>This is a VERY EARLY draft - only partially complete. The WpfUI and SilverlightUI sample projects are also only partially complete.</p>
<p>I am leaving now for a fishing trip in a remote part of Minnesota and will be out of touch for a few days. I wanted to get some content online before I left - hence the early state of this draft.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll resume working on this ebook when I return from my trip.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
