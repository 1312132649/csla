<p>I&#39;ve got all the bindings working so that a PropertyStatus is behaving properly when it is bound to a business object property. When I change the object at run time however, the PropertyStatus does not react at all to changes in the property in the new object. What am I doing wrong? I follow the instructions in Rocky&#39;s 3rd video in the Csla4 Silverlight MVVM series.</p>
<p>I am using WPF.</p>
<p>Any help or guidance appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
