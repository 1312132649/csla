<br>
What best practices or patterns have people arrived at for bubbling child modification and validation changes up an object graph to its parents?<br>
<br>
So for example, suppose I have a page that is editing a Person object
and its child sub-objects: (this is a contrived and simplified example,
not my actual scenario), and I have the following object hierarchy:<br>
<br>
Person<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; |---- ContactDetails<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |---- Address<br>
<br>
<br>
I have some buttons on the page that are databound to Person properties like IsValid and IsModified..&nbsp; <br>
<br>
How do you bubble up changes to the modification and validation status of the child objects to the root parent?<br>
<br>
So basically, if a user opens the page and just changes one of the
properties on the Address child object, giving it an invalid value, I
need the IsValid and IsModified property of the parent Person object to
change and notify its databound observers.<br>
<br>
Ideally, I am looking at doing this automatically - so creating some
mechanism to automatically bubble up changes to these properties up the
object graph. Either using reflection, or something like the
RoutedEvent system in WPF.<br>
<br>
How do you do it?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
