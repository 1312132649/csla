<P>Here is the scenario:&nbsp; I am create a web site that has a web server, application server, and database server.&nbsp; The data the object in concern contains is sensitive but needs to persistent between two sites.&nbsp; The data is entertered by the user and can not be saved to a database (credit card information) but I also don't want to store the data in session.&nbsp; The idea was to create an anchored object and just store the proxy in the session which will access the application server when its properties are called.&nbsp; Is this possible using Csla or do I need to create another remoting server and client for this single object?</P>
<P>Thanks for the help,</P>

<P>Your best bet is probably to use a service oriented model. See Chapter 11 for information on this approach.</P>
<P>Given that it is sensitive information, you probably should use WCF with encryption, or web services with SSL to talk to the app server.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
