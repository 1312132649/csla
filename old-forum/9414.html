<p>My project is not using the MVVM pattern, but it&#39;s using CSLA 4.0. Would this training video still be useful for that purpose?</p>
<p>Also, is this the kind of video that could be made&nbsp;available at the corporate library at my site or is there a&nbsp;per user licence for this?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Friday, August 20, 2010</h2><p>Rocky is the best person to answer the second question (though I suspect the answer is that it&#39;s a per-user license).</p>
<p>As for the first, no, you wouldn&#39;t get much out of the MVVM video series if you&#39;re not using MVVM.&nbsp; That&#39;s the thrust of the series - how to use CSLA in an MVVM way.&nbsp; I know Rocky is working on a more general CSLA 4 video series, but I have no idea his schedule on that.</p>
<p>HTH</p>

If you want to purchase a copy for a corporate library please contact me directly and I&#39;m happy to discuss special licensing.</p>
<p>The MVVM series is very much focused on Silverlight, WPF and MVVM. It is not a replacement for the Core 3.8 video series (or the future Core 4 video series - which unfortunately won&#39;t be out for at least 2-3 months given my schedule).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
