<p>In my MVC 5-Project I want to use MS Identity for Authorization and Authentication. I have built my application according to the EncapsulatedDto-model, hence&nbsp;I among my projects&nbsp;have a Dal, DalSql, Library, and WcfPortal&nbsp;Project. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;m want to use Claims-based Authorization, and could of course put Everything in the MVC-Project since MS Identity with its EF-approach is separated from my other database,but then I break my separation of logic, so this is not the way to go as I see it. </p>
<p>I want to use the Identiy and Principal&nbsp;classes in CSLA, and separate all security logic from the UI-part, but am a Little unsure which way to go. The way I&#39;m thinking is to have the usual Identity and&nbsp;Principal&nbsp;classes (inheriting from CslaIdentityBase&nbsp;and CslaPrincipal),&nbsp;in my Library Project, and then create a separate Concrete DalSqlEf-project which only handles the security parts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your comments on this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
