<P>This app will be communicating with several servers through seperate instances of the same object.&nbsp; I haven't tried this yet, but will the technique of subclassing the proxy allow each instance to communicate to its own backend server or does the endpoint property technique result in all objects communicating to the same back end?</P>
<P>Thanks for you help in advance on this!</P>
