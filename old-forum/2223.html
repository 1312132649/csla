It looks pretty easy to use and flexible. I know the opinions of Rocky and most of the people on this forum (including myself) about ORM, but flexibility, DB independence, disconnected mode and ease of use&nbsp;are some things&nbsp;that got my attention. I'm interested if someone tried this ORM and even more if someone merged functionalaty of CSLA and OpenAccess. I think that OpenAccess's transparent persistence could be injected in CSLA, using its Authorisation and Business rules, factory methods recommendation, maybe even mobility and more.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, January 29, 2007</h2>I don't remember reading about OpenAccess here, so I'm not sure anyone has merged them.&nbsp; I wouldn't think that a good idea anyway; ORM and Csla are trying to solve two different problems, so merging them doesn't seem like it would work very well.&nbsp; After all, you wouldn't want your Csla objects to be representations of the database schema, and that's probably what you'd have to do in order to 'merge' the two frameworks.<br><br>Now I doubt there'd be any problem using them together, just like you'd use NHibernate + csla to achive database independance.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
