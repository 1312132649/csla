I guess some clone operation is carried out by the dataportal?<br /><br />All methods relating to the dataportal i.e. child_insert etc, explicitly sets the field..<br /><br />How should I handle such nonserializable fields?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2>If the field isn't serialized, it won't be included when it goes through the dataportal in either direction.&nbsp; So you'll have to recreate the value on the other end if you need it.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fsl replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2>Thx. That exactly what I'm trying to do. I just discovered the OnDeserialized event, so I guess my troubles are over :)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2>Opps... ya I probably should have pointed that out. <img src="/emoticons/emotion-10.gif" alt="Embarrassed [:$]" />&nbsp; but glad you were able to find it on your own.&nbsp; </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
