<P>Anyway, one question is, I checked the .xap file for Rolodex and noticed in the AppManifest that there was a Rolodex.Business.dll.&nbsp; I then checked the project files for Rolodex.Business.Client and Rolodex.Business.Server and noticed that they both had the namespace of Rolodex.Business.&nbsp; I then went into my project files of BAS.Business.Client and BAS.Business.Server and made sure they were BAS.Business.&nbsp; Before that in my AppManifest file there was only a BAS.Business.Client file.&nbsp; Why are the 2 put into one namespace and thereby one .dll file?</P>
<P>Another problem I am having is then when I fire up my application, I see the word BAS in the title of the Default.aspx page.&nbsp; Same place you see Rolodex in the Rolodex example.&nbsp; However, my login page has not displayed in the last couple of times I ran the application.&nbsp; It showed up a couple of times, then stopped.&nbsp; Is there a problem with running the Rolodex example in an instance of Visual Studio 2008 and running my BAS in another instance of Visual Studio 2008 simultaniously?&nbsp; On both Web projects I have the Auto-assign port option selected so there should be no contention with ports as they are auto assigned.</P>
<P>Also, sometimes when I run the Rolodex example I see <A href="http://localhost:4863/">http://localhost:4863/</A> and the login page appears and sometimes I see <A href="http://localhost:4863/Default.aspx">http://localhost:4863/Default.aspx</A>.&nbsp; I am thinking some of these things must be related to why my Login Page is not showing up but I just don't have enough experience with Silverlight yet to be able to determine what I am doing wrong.</P>
<P>Finally, thanks for all your support in these forums.&nbsp; The product Csla and all the support provided, make this framework a no-brainer to use in business applications.</P>
