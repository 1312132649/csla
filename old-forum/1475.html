<p class="MsoNormal">I have just ordered the book, so I really know
NOTHING!&nbsp; <br>
<br>
However, the one thing in my current project that seems difficult is that I
want the users to be able to create ad-hock custom data fields.&nbsp; This is a
commercial application that will print government forms using the Active
Reports End User Designer.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>

<span>The issue is that we do not have the resources to know
all the forms and required data points that may be needed.&nbsp; So we want to
allow the users to create custom fields.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Our current design is to create a field dictionary table and a table that holds the data, one row for each data point.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any suggestion on how to approach this in this framework?</span></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
