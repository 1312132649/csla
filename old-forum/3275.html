On the form, I have an Undo button. In the button I have: <br> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BindingSource1.RaiseListChangedEvents = False <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BindingSource1.CancelEdit() <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BindingSource1.RaiseListChangedEvents = True <br> </p><p>If I dirty a record and immediately click Undo, it correctly reverts the changed value. However, if I dirty a record in the grid, navigate to a new record, and then click Undo, the CancelEdit call does not revert the changed value. I have also tried calling my object's CancelEdit method directly, but this yielded the same result.<br> </p>Any help is appreciated. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bgilbert replied on Thursday, July 26, 2007</h2>I found a solution to this here:<br>http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/14779.aspx<br><br>but I wonder if more current version of CSLA has addressed this more succinctly.<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
