(And, of course, Save button is not an option.)&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>The UI screen has two segments, top&nbsp;segment shows a list (BusinessListBase) in a ListBox, the bottom has a panel where user can add individual child objects. The user clicks an Add New&nbsp;button to bring up the data entry segment, which has only two fields, the content of&nbsp;only the top field is displayed in the ListBox, and it&nbsp;appears in the list as soon as the user starts typing in the top field (it is probably becuase it is an AutoCompleteBox).&nbsp; I need to handle two issues (which were handled by the Update button in Csla2.0 and earlier).</p>
<p>1. I need the data entry panel to disappear when the user is done. I use the VisibilyConverter based on the List being Empty at the start, but after 1 record it won&#39;t work.&nbsp; User can click the Add New button anytime to add a new child which will clear out the fields, but it&#39;s not very neat.</p>
<p>2. If the user types in the second field (which is optional) and instead of tabbing out first, just reaches for the mouse to click Add New - the data in the second field gets wasted.&nbsp; I did add a &quot;pretend&quot; Update button which helps but since it doesn&#39;t do anything, and especially since I cannot make the Panel invisible, it is not very neat either.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest something more definitive?</p>
