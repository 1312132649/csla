I am tasked with creating business objects that bind to custom controls and move away from link everything with a datasets. <SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>The columns/fields returned from the database can change at runtime and I need a business object that can change its properties based on the data.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The DBA can ensure that fields in the database use standard names so that I can coded against field names. However the DBA can’t predict what field will be in the staging database at any given time, and it might even change in a session. <SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>The data does not require editing, this application only display data collected from outside sources.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>In the past I would use look up tables to supply data validation, business rules, formatting information, and captions for each field in the database but I’m ready to find something better.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I prefer to be able to display data based on user profiles and the current schema. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>So fare I <SPAN>researched</SPAN> data driven object factories and data mapping frameworks but it did not find anything that addressed the dynamic properties with good examples. I’m really impressed with the Expert C# 2005 Business Objects book and would love to apply the CLAS.Net frame work so that I can provide serialized object from the web serves but I’m not sure how to build create the properties list.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>If anyone has suggestions please let me know. </P>

<P class=MsoNormal>Thank you,</P>

<P>We had to write our own mini-framework to handle these Dynamic Attributes.&nbsp; So we have classes that "understand" a boolean value, an item from a dropdown list, a number - those kinds of things.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we have supporting UI code that knows how to take a Dynamic Attribute and render it into a valid UI control with the correct value.&nbsp; And then get the values back from it afterwards to do a Save().</P>
<P>It's not trivial to get it all working and you'll need to use a fair amount of reflection-based code to determine types dynamically at runtime.</P>
<P>But if you really need a truly flexible&nbsp;BO, then it's probably your only option.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
