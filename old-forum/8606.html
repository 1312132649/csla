<p>When I use the context menu option in my browser on those RSS links, I am told the addtion of that link succeeded and it shows me link text like: <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/rss.aspx?ForumID=8&amp;Mode=0">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/rss.aspx?ForumID=8&amp;Mode=0</a></p>
<p>There is a manually way to add feeds, too.&nbsp; So I can just type in that link text.&nbsp; And both of these methods seem to have the same effect. The only text in the links that changes when adding links for the different discussion areas here is the ForumID value.&nbsp; I thought I had these links working yesterday.&nbsp; But I&#39;ve discovered that the reader is populating all its CSLA folders with the content from the most recently-added&nbsp;discussion.&nbsp; So presently, the Code-gen Templates, VS Templates, and Forum Administration folders are all populated with the posts from CLSA.NET discusson.</p>
<p>Is this likely a problem with my reader, or have I just given it ambiguous link text?&nbsp; Should there be a different value for Mode?&nbsp; </p>
<p>FYI, I have feeds set up successfully from the DevExpress community forums which behave properly and whose links have the same Mode=0 value in their links (for example, <a href="http://community.devexpress.com/forums/rss.aspx?ForumID=172&amp;Mode=0">http://community.devexpress.com/forums/rss.aspx?ForumID=172&amp;Mode=0</a>&nbsp;for the XtraReports discussion area).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
