I tried searching online but I don't think I'm phrasing my issue correctly, so I'm not seeing any relevant results and am running out of time.<br><br>I've built an app on my machine which happens to have .NET 3.5. However, the business is using .NET 2.0, and when I try to install the app on a 2.0 box, it fails with a message indicating .NET 3.5 is required. Upgrading the target machine to .NET 3.5 is not an option (long story). Is there any way to make the app compatible? I didn't see any options in the setup project to do this. <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dlambert replied on Monday, January 25, 2010</h2>If you're not actually using any of the .Net 3.5 features, you can change the solution to target the 2.0 framework when it builds (see "Target Framework" in the project's properties).  If you're using 3.5 features, then you're going to have to upgrade client machines to the 3.5 framework.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, January 26, 2010</h2>Hi Erik, <br><br>Are you using CSLA in your application? <br><br>Here are some hints that may help you on your path:<br><ul><li>If you are using CSLA then try to make your app use<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/n2.aspx"> CSLA N2</a>&nbsp;</li><li>If you are using C# 3.0 syntax in your project downgrade to .NET 2.0 and add reference to <a href="http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/linqbridge.aspx">LinqBridge</a></li></ul>CSLA N2 also contains LinqBridge and will run on .NET 2.0 with SP1 (SP1 is required for MethodCaller in CSLA.NET). <br><br>LINQBridge is a reimplementation of all the standard query operators in 
Framework 3.5's Enumerable class (<b>Linq2Objects</b>) and  also includes Framework 3.5's generic <b>Func</b> and <b>Action</b> 
delegates, as well as <b>ExtensionAttribute</b>, allowing you to use C# 3.0's extension 
methods in Framework 2.0.&nbsp; LinqBridge will run on .NET 2.0 (even without SP1). <br><br>You will not have access to any libraries that require .NET 3.5 (such as EntitiyFramework, Linq2SQL and WCF) so for a CSLA prject your dataportal will only be able to use WebServices, Remoting or EnterpriseServices. <br><br>Yout setup project will not help you - rather you must set the target framework to .NET 2.0 on all your projects and remove references to 3.0 or 3.5 libraries. Then add a reference to LinqBridge (for C# 3.0 syntax) and resolve any leftover issues from usage of 3.0/3.5 libraries should do the trick.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ErikJL replied on Tuesday, January 26, 2010</h2>Sorry I should have indicated the version we are using; we're using CSLA 3.0.5. I'm also not using any of the post .NET 2.0 functionality in any of the projects.<br><br>Thanks for showing me where to find the .NET version dependency info! I went through each project but unfortunately all were set to .NET 2.0 already. There are some other files in the setup project's "detected dependency" list I suspect may have .NET 3.5 dependancy, so one of those must be the culprit.<br><br>EDIT: SMDiagnostics.dll is in the dependancy list and looks to be version 3.0, and since it's referenced in the GAC, I'm assuming it's also dependant on .NET 3.0. I'm going to try excluding this first.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dlambert replied on Wednesday, January 27, 2010</h2>I know you don't want to upgrade to 3.0, so this isn't directly applicable, but I thought it might be interesting to someone following this thread:<br /><br />http://dotnetinstaller.codeplex.com/<br /><br />This is supposed to help w/ getting correct pre-reqs installed on client machines.  I haven't tried it yet myself.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
