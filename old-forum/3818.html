<P>I bought/downloaded Rocky's new CSLA 3 e-book, which discusses using the two together but&nbsp;he assumes you have at least some minimal knowledge of WWF -- I have zero experience with WWF.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Can anyone recommend a good book on Windows Workflow Foundation?</STRONG><BR><BR>(none of the WWF books online have reviews yet.....maybe since they're new)<BR><BR>Thanks,<BR><BR>Jason</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeanB replied on Wednesday, October 31, 2007</h2><P>I have the Apress book and it is pretty cool.&nbsp; The cheapest place I have ever seen to buy books is called Nerdbooks.&nbsp; The book is here:</P>

<P>The store is in Plano and it is&nbsp;paradise for geeks!&nbsp; If you live local you can put it in the notes when you buy the book.&nbsp; Then you can go by the warehouse and pick up your order if you like.</P>
<P>Hope this helps.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
