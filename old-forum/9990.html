Is there anything else I need to do to get the value across?</p>

Even if you don&#39;t need the top-level steroetype support from BB or ROB, you should look at the MobileXYZ types in Csla.Core - like MobileObject.</p>
<p>In short, you really don&#39;t want to implement IMobileObject yourself if you can avoid it, and we already provide some basic implementations that might meet your requirements.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Wednesday, January 26, 2011</h2><p>That worked! I had to change my List&lt;CustomType&gt; to a Csla.Core.MobileList&lt;CustomType&gt;.&nbsp; Is that normal?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 26, 2011</h2><p>The MobileFormatter can only serialize types that implement IMobileObject - that includes the entire object graph, so lists, objects, dictionaries, you name it.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Friday, January 28, 2011</h2><p>That makes sense.&nbsp; Thanks!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
