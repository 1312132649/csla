<p>We have an Order Status property and and Order Item Status property. &nbsp; These are stored in the database as integers and in teh objects we have an Enum so the users can set the properties like so...<br /><br />Order.OrderStatus_ID = OrderStatus.BackOrdered; &nbsp;(which would store a 4 in my database)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in a web service, how exactly do I communicate this to the consumer? &nbsp;I can&#39;t pass an Enum in a simple value object DTO. &nbsp;Is it something I just have to give them in some sort of documentation? &nbsp;I suppose I can just pass the text to them instead of the integer when they getOrders, but when they are editing existing orders they need to know what each integer stands for?&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, May 17, 2010</h2><p>Web services don&#39;t define semantic meaning, only syntactic standardization. In other words, the consumer of a service doesn&#39;t automatically know how to interpret the results - they just know the proper structure of the messages necessary to make the call and receive the result.</p>
<p>This is, imo, one of hte weaknesses of the whole model. It doesn&#39;t really work unless you also provide human-readable documentation so someone can understand the semantic meaning of your information...</p>
<p>That&#39;s a long-winded way of saying that you can do whatever you want, as long as you document it. Use numeric values - they are universal. And if you want, expose a second service that returns human-readable text for the numeric values - thus simulating the enum concept as part of your overall contract.</p>
<p>Or just expose the numeric values and provide a web page for the consumer of your service to read what each value means. That&#39;s arguably just as good.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ltgrady replied on Tuesday, May 18, 2010</h2><p>I think i&#39;m going to use integers and just create another method called getOrderStatusList that will return a list of the text values and integers that go with them. &nbsp;With some documentation as well.</p>
<p><br />But i agree, if I have to explain it with documentation then something seems a little off.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
