Right now it appears that the best way to make the parent available is to pass the parent object in as an argument to Child_Fetch or Child_Create. Would it be possible for DataPortal.FetchChild and DataPortal.CreateChild to accept a parent argument, and set the parent prior to calling the Child_xxx methods?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
