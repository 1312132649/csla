I am not sure from the outside but it seems that the server has trouble coping with the workload...<br>Maybe there is some caching which could be turned on in IIS or Community Server which is turned off at the moment?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Patrick</font><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 22, 2008</h2><P>My guess is that it is a combination of things - we're running a very old CS release and I need to upgrade, and the server is a VM running on a physical box with several other VMs and sometimes runs into constraints based on activity on those other VMs.</P>
