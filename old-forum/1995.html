<P>this is the response that i get from my employer after sending the license agreement to the law people.</P>

<P><SPAN><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>am i missing something here. CSLA was written for exactly this purpose wasn't it. i am not going to pretend i have read the license agreement nor do i want to, i just want to get my work done.</FONT></SPAN></P>

Is is that if CSLA does something bad then your company is not libel for damages?&nbsp; I would have thought that one overall disclaimer in their license would cover all that. What happens if you use a third party component like a grid or something or even just use a technique that you read in a book or online? Do they need a disclaimer for that?&nbsp; How would anyone know what part of your software did something bad anyway?<br><br>Or .. are they worried about the clause in Rocky's license that says your rights to use it can be terminated if you breach the license? Maybe they're worried that Rocky is going to wake up one day and decide that your company can no longer use CSLA so where would that leave your customers? I'm just throwing thoughts in the air there.<br><br>Cheers<br>Ross<br><br><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>steveb:</strong></div><div><em>"<span>At minimum, we would have to update our license agreements and put disclaimers on it that include the CSLA declaimers.&nbsp; This acceptance process won’t be short."</span></em>

<P>Lawyers.</P>
<P>We sell commercial software and did nothing special at all about CSLA. To us it is just another component in our software which we happen to get to use free of charge by Rocky.</P>
<P>Since we are not selling a framework we did not violate Rocky's wide open license agreement.</P>
<P>I doubt you are either.</P>
<P>Good luck getting the lawyers out of the way though. Once they are in, they will want to make a ruling (and charge a fee).</P>

<P>this is actually the second employer in a row that i have pitched csla at and only been turned down because the license agreement was sent to the lawyers and deemed unsatisfactory.</P>
<P>c'est la vie ... i guess.</P>

<P>Does your legal department have a similar qualm with EntLib?</P>

<P>Well, that's not fun at all. Rocky's intent seems clear, but I'm no lawyer either.</P>
<P>I don't know if you have the details, but if you do, I'd be curious to what the attorneys object about. That is, what about the license agreement don't they like?</P>
<P>I'm only asking because I'm curious about the objections/details, if you have them. If you don't, or can't share, that's cool. No worries.</P>
<P>Regards,</P>
<P>Mike</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>steveb replied on Monday, December 18, 2006</h2><P>no qualms with Ent Lib, that has shipped in our products.</P>
<P>my n00b understanding is it has to do with a couple&nbsp;of things. first and formost was patent infringement liability. something about my employer, not&nbsp;rocky,&nbsp;would have to take legal responsibility if in the future somone claimed that csla infringed on their patent.</P>
<P>second, and this is the reason the other employer said no as well, is concerns about Intellectual Property rights. i dont really know any more details on that.</P>
<P>if you are interested in hearing what some larger corporations have to say about all this rocky let me know, i could probably get a more formal description for you on a private channel. </P>
<P>for now i will just take what i have learned about OOA/D while studying CSLA and be grateful i have a book i can refer others to when they would like to learn about it as well</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, December 21, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/basicblue/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>steveb:</strong></div><div>my n00b understanding is it has to do with a couple&nbsp;of things. first
