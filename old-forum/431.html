<P>Look in your CSLA folder's .\CSLA10\doc folder and you should see CSLA.NET.chm.</P>
<P>I guess he might have overlooked it in 2.0, but I doubt it.&nbsp; He might have found another location for it, I suppose.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>antoan replied on Thursday, June 22, 2006</h2>Nope, I looked in all v2.0 - v2.02 of the framework and there aren't any. I'm looking into using XSTL to make  docs from the compiler generated xml file. <br /><br />Thanx</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MichaelBosch replied on Thursday, June 22, 2006</h2>Check out this blog entry... I'm used this version of NDoc with great success on 2.0<br>
