But it allows the main form access even if the password is not supplied (with restricted options)</P>
<P>can anybody share their ideas on how they are taking care of custom login. i want to know following things :-</P>
<P>1. If you are prompting for custom login at startup, where exactly you are putting the code to ask password, is it in Mainform's load</P>
<P>2. Are you showing any splash screens, if yes then what is the sequence, is it </P>
<P>Login-&gt;Splash-&gt;MainForm..</P>
