The Product column shows the product object's ID.<br><br>What would be the correct way to parse/interpret the product object to either show the product ID and product.description property or only the description property on the product object in the datagrid?<br><br>I hope I'm clear enough.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, October 03, 2007</h2><P>Almost certainly what is happening here is that data binding is seeing the Product property as a complex type, so it calls ToString() to get a value from it that can be displayed. The default ToString() is your id value. But you can override ToString() to return a description or something else.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Pieterv replied on Thursday, October 04, 2007</h2>Thank you Rocky.<br><br>It works like a charm!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
