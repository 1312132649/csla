<p>Async LazyLoad is Async LazyLoad, Silverlight or no Silverlight. Have a look at this thread</p>

<p>When I click on a row it fetches the data for that row and by clicking on the &quot;+&quot; It displays correctly in the tab.&nbsp; When I click on another row, it fetches that data, but the previous tab now shows the newly fetched data for the row that I just clicked on.&nbsp;The data template is showing the data for the current row, no matter what row I am displaying the data in.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I also get a fetch of data every time I click on a row, it doesn&#39;t seem to retain the data already fetched.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are minor problems that I am sure that I can work through.</p>
