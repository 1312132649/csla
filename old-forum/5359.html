I use GetProperty(Of T) in my getter, but I am forced to use an<br>If CanWriteProperty("PropertyNameStringLiteral") Then ...End If <br>construct in my setter part. This is because I want to avoid the call to <br>PropertyHasChanged. I delegate the property setting to a child object, <br>where PropertyHasChanged is then called explicitly.) I further rely on the ChildChanded event...<br><br>To be consistent with the 3.5-idea of reducing the string literals to a minimum,&nbsp; what we need are <br>overrides of CanReadProperty and CanWriteProperty that take a PropertyInfo-object reference as a parameter. <br>Obviously the same applies to PropertyHasChanged().<br><br>I hope this makes sense to you.<br><br>[EDIT]<br>Forget what I wrote above. Andy just showed me the way... and it is so obvious! <br>Using the Name property of the PropertyInfo object is the way to go here, <br>even I have already done it that way. I'll have to blame it on IntelliSense...<br>("Hey, there are missing some parameter alternatives!")<img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br>[/EDIT]<br><br>Stefan<br><br><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, September 08, 2008</h2>Can you do?<br><br>if ( CanWriteProperty( NameProperty.Name ) ) { // code here }<br><br>Where NameProperty is the static property variable.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
