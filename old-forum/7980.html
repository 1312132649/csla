<P>For more detailed discussion of the database and object design you'll need to look at the <EM>Expert 2008 Business Objects</EM> book.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Monday, July 05, 2010</h2><p>Hi</p>
<p>I apologise if this has been asked before, I searched the forums but found nothing.</p>
<p>Are there any later instructions for setting up PTTracker for&nbsp;CslaSamples-4.0.0-100625?</p>
<p>I would like to get PTWin running with a WCFServer (not using IIS).</p>
<p>I&#39;d appreciate it if someone could give me a hand.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 06, 2010</h2><p>I don&#39;t have any instructions for setting up a data portal with a custom Windows service or with AppFabric or with WAS.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t worry about that too much, or haven&#39;t anyway, since there are just two things to worry about:</p>
<ol>
<li>get all your DLL files in the right folder</li>
<li>get your web.config file set up correctly</li>
</ol>
<p>You can find information on MSDN and in books on how to work with WAS in general. And the web.config information from my books is the same for WAS as it is for IIS/ASP.NET.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Tuesday, July 06, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Rocky</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
