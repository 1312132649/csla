<p>Just wondering if anyone has any workarounds for the IDataErrorInfo shortfall in the Telerik component. Specifically, I&#39;m binding an EditableRootList to a standard Telerik RadGridView via a standard winform binding source. No fancy heirarchies, or anything. </p>
<p>When I delete a row (in this case customer from Northwind database), I get an expected foreign key constraint exception, as I have orders for that customer. </p>
<p>The .NET grid catches the IDataErrorInfo event, and I can compensate accordingly, however, the telerik grid doesnt catch it, and I drop out to my main application thread exception handler, which puts the form (and grid) in an indeterminate state.</p>
<p>Any assistance, greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Also, a tidbit for anyone using telerik with ERLB - you have to disable Sorting, otherwise occasionally two rows get added to the grid!!!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sean.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, February 03, 2011</h2><p>Which version of csla are you using? </p>
<p>SortedBindingList was updated on March 5th 2010. The ItemDeleted event was raised with iccorrect ItemIndex which would confuse dataBinding (DataGridView). </p>
<p>Other important fixes was also made in 2009:</p>
<p>* Fix double-event issue when adding item to unsorted SortedBindingList<br />* Fix issue where CancelNew didn&#39;t work properly.
</p>
<p>If you are not using Csla 4.1 then I would suggest to update both SortedBindingList.cs and FilteredBindingList.cs in your version of Csla.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also quite sure that your grid is NOT looking at the<b> IDataErrorInfo</b> when a delete fails. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.idataerrorinfo.aspx">IDataErrorInfo </a>is used only for Validation and provide error messages for object/property. If a Delete fails you should get a DataPortalException that obviously is not handled by your code and thus reaches the application thread exception handler. </p>
<p>Are you using a DynamicListBase&nbsp; list object here for your grid? </p>
<p>Do you handle <span>currency-related exceptions<span><span class="selflink"></span></span></span> the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.bindingsource.aspx">BindingSource.DataError </a>event?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>SeanD replied on Friday, February 04, 2011</h2><p>Hi Jonny,</p>
<p>I&#39;m using 3.8.1, so fairly up to date, I guess.</p>
<p>We also use the EditableRootListBase for the collection of objects - I&#39;ll try the SortedBindingList.</p>
<p>I understand that the IDataErrorInfo interface is used for validation, but in the standard .NET DataGrid, I can catch the DataPortalException in the DataError event handler - just not in the 3rd party one.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the update.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
