<P>My first post and it's a doozie I think...</P>
<P>I'm using the CSLA 2.0 framework as a base for a project I am leading, and very much like the functionality of the Winpart inheritance.</P>
<P>My question is, I would like to utilize the this inheritance as the user 'drills down'.. So, e.g. the user selects "new customer search" and is presented with the selection dialogue, this fires a 'displaycustomer' form and I can add&nbsp;a new item to the documents list. This works fine, but what I'd LIKE to do is then have the user select a customer a drill down further to display customer details/orders. Is it possible (in an OO way) to reference the subs/references in Mainform to add my details form to the list? Or should I be approaching this differently?</P>
<P>Any ideas/suggestions would be much appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
<P>Graham</P>
