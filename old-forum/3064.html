This change has messed up our form layouts. Do CSLA panels need the layout functionality?<br><br>Thanks...&nbsp; -Paul<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 21, 2007</h2><P>It was a question of changing the class names (because they weren't panels) or making them actual panels.</P>
<P>I chose to make them actual panel controls, because that's how they are used (as a container). I got tired of always having to put a container inside a "panel" so I could actually put any content on the form. Making the controls be actual panels eliminated a bunch of "junk" XAML.</P>
<P>And it seemed harmless (since you can always put another layout control inside the panel).</P>
<P>If it is not harmless, I'll consider going the other way and renaming all the controls from blahPanel to blahDecorator - though I personally am not too keen on having to go back and add all that extra XAML into my forms.</P>
<P>Now is a good time for this discussion (today and tomorrow), because I'm just wrapping up for Beta 2.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Paul Czywczynski replied on Thursday, June 21, 2007</h2>Actually all our forms have root grids. We liked the greater flexablity of the grids as a root element instead of panels. Since the CSLA panels were just decorators we just put them around the grids. Now that they are stack panels it screws up our grid and child container formatting. <br>I guess its more of a phylisophical question. Should the CSLA panels affect layout or not? In lieu of having to change nearly 100 forms you know my answer but that shouldn't drive the design of the framework.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 21, 2007</h2><P>I see what you are saying, and I find this to be a tough question.</P>
<P>Making the controls "invisible" makes them flexible, but ultimately adds to the XAML required on a form.</P>
<P>I tried making them be a "lookless" panel (inherit from Panel directly), but that's not possible. If they are actual "panel" controls, then they must control layout - that's the definition of a panel.</P>
<P>But I kept trying to put stuff "into" ValidationPanel, which of course didn't work. So I'd always have to go back and wrap the content with a StackPanel inside the ValidationPanel - that was the instigation for the change.</P>
<P>I suppose you are ultimately right. My guess is that 90% of the time having them be a real panel would be beneficial, but it probably precludes the other 10% from working at all... </P>
<P>But I do have to rename them, because keeping "Panel" on the end confuses me continually, and will almost certainly confuse many other people over the coming years.</P>
<P>I'm thinking either "Decorator" (to keep with the base class name) or "Provider". Or I could do what Microsoft appears to do and use no postfix at all:</P>
<P>Validator<BR>Authorizer<BR>ObjectStatus</P>
<P>That is probably the right answer.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>okoboji replied on Tuesday, June 26, 2007</h2>Good timing for this discussion, I posted some thoughts on my blog: <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/06/wpf-and-csla-and-subclassing-panel.html">http://work.j832.com/2007/06/wpf-and-csla-and-subclassing-panel.html</a><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
