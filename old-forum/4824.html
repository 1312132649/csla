<P>At my company(Manufacturing, 1500 employees), I am currently involved in developing the new architecture using .Net and CSLA. I find the CSLA framework very interesting but I find it is a little bit hard to get into this frame of thinking and I have numerous questions about the CSLA, source code management, team coordination, deployment, etc.</P>
<P>Therefore, I am looking for some people already using the CSLA framework and business objects in production environment in the Montreal, Qc area, willing to share their experience with me. Hope fully, you have come up with a great solution for development, deployment and maintenance of your business objects and application.</P>
<P>If anybody has suggestions, they will be appreciated. Your help would be invaluable. Contact me through this forum.</P>
<P>TIA</P>
