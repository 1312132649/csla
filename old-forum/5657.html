<P>How do i open the 3.0.5 CSLA Source code. I have a Visual Studio 2005 with .net 2.0 and 3.5 , but when i try to open it it wont open.. Do i missing something..</P>
<P>Is there any tutorial on how to use the CSLA basic foundation so that we can have a better understanding the CSLA framework..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks :-)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, October 22, 2008</h2><P>What is the error you get trying to open the sln file?</P>
<P>I must say that I haven't tested 3.0.5 on a machine where .NET 3.5 is installed. 3.0.5 supports .NET 2.0 and 3.0, and I suppose it is possible (though unlikely) that .NET 3.5 would break it.</P>
<P>Regarding a tutorial, the documentation for the framework is the books:</P>
<P><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?area=4&amp;id=a79647a6-2557-4af2-b67e-cc18762acb40">http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?area=4&amp;id=a79647a6-2557-4af2-b67e-cc18762acb40</A></P>
<P>The books are also the way the framework is funded. To be blunt, I avoid charging for the framework by charging for the documentation. So for better or worse, having a comprehensive tutorial that undermines book sales would be counterproductive for all of us.</P>
<P>However, if you look back through the DNR TV archives (<A href="http://www.dnrtv.com">www.dnrtv.com</A>) you'll find a number of shows where I walk through the basics of using CSLA .NET - that might qualify as a basic tutorial of sorts.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>XML_Single replied on Thursday, October 23, 2008</h2><P>When i try to double click the SLN file :</P>
<P>The selected file is a solution file, but it was created by a newer version of this application and cannot be opened, when i try to click the OK button , The operation could not be completed. Unspecified Error. I am using Visual Studio 2005 with .net framework 2.0 and 3.5.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, October 23, 2008</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Are you sure you downloaded 3.0.5 and not 3.5.2?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I only ask, because I just downloaded both VB and C# versions onto
a machine with VS 2005 and they open just fine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
