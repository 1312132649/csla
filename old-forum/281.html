If that is your expectation then it will probably always be "incomplete", because that's not its purpose in my mind.</P>
<P>It is, of course, possible to use data binding and templated fields at the same time - I do this in the PTWeb project. In that case the data binding infrastructure does provide those values and so DataMapper is able to use them. If you look at DataMapper, it is not complex, nor is it intended to be complex. It really is just a mapper from one object into another.</P>
<P>I guess what I'm saying, in short, is that web technologies remain quite immature in some ways, and I view this whole thing as a limitation of data binding in the web more than anything else.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BigRon replied on Monday, June 19, 2006</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>Thank you for clarifying the capabilities.&nbsp; I think what would be helpful for the community is to provide some "best practices" for how we should map data from controls into their associated object properties.&nbsp; For example, I mentioned in my last post that I was using .FindControlById("id") and then accessing the public property of the object with the control value.&nbsp; Just wondering if there might be a better way to move those values into the object.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
