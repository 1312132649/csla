<P>I've compiled all the CSLA libraries into a single assembly, but now I can't get remoting to work. I think I should be changing something in the web.config file, but I don't know what or how it should be changed. Could anyone please help me.</P>
<P>Much appreciated,</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Wednesday, December 13, 2006</h2><P>I'm a little surprised at your attempt to compile all the CSLA components into a single assembly.&nbsp; I can't articulate the reasons they&nbsp; should be in separate ones, but I believe they should be. </P>
<P>I believe the book is pretty clear on this in both 1.x and 2.x - but I'm in a hotel room about 2000 miles from those books.&nbsp; The end of chapter two (framework design, namespace organization ) and most of chapter three (framework implementation) address these issues - at least in the 2.x book (I looked at the pdf version on my laptop).</P>
<P>Maybe by separating them back out, you'll get what you want.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Wednesday, December 13, 2006</h2><P>cjherasmus,</P>
<P>You just compiled CSLA, right? You didn't modify any source?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cjherasmus replied on Wednesday, December 13, 2006</h2><P>Michael,</P>
<P>Yes, just compile, no modifications to the existing source.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cjherasmus replied on Wednesday, December 13, 2006</h2><P>The idea was to keep the CSLA namespaces as they are,but to have only one dll.</P>
<P>There's no particular reason why I want to compile CSLA into a single assembly. To me it doesn't matter if there are one dll or 4 dll's. I was just experimenting with the idea.</P>
