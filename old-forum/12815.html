<p>We would like to add server-side data portal exception logging (since the server is in our dmz which has access to our database where we can log it. )</p>
<p>Can this be done in 3.8x?&nbsp; I was hoping that it would raise some kind of exception event that we could subscribe too but I don&#39;t see anything.</p>
<p>It is NOT a have-to-do item but would be nice.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>The only way to do this is to implement DataPortal_OnDataPortalException method in your &quot;root&quot; objects (read: Object that your code call DataPortal.Create/Fetch/Execute/Update/Delete root methods on). You may also choose to implement these in your own intermediate base classes.</p>
<p>This will give you access to the exception that occurred but you cannot change the exception.</p>
<p>Not sure when this method was implemented. it is not in CSLA 3.0.5 but is in CSLA 3.8.x.</p>
