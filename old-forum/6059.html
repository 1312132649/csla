We noticed that Dr. Watson was running as an IIS app pool&nbsp;identity, eating about&nbsp;15-25% of CPU. We also noticed that all app pools could be stopped&nbsp;gracefully except the one that the CSLA portal runs under. </P>
<P>We are using the WCF Dataportal.</P>
<P>Can anyone give me things to check for that might cause this behavior. Has anyone else expirenced this? We don't see this locally of course.</P>
<P>Thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
