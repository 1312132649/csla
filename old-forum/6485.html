I am using VS 2008 (VB.NET) and CSLA.NET 3.6, at runtime i am changing my connection string and its working fine. My connection string is storing in app.config file so anybody can open and see my connection string. so I would like to secure my connection string which contains user name and password of SQL Server. Would anyone help me out!!!

Thanks
