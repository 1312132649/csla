In my UI, I create a SortedBindingList using these as parameters. Everything works great.<br /><br />Now in version 2 of my app, I need to subclass ProductionOrder (let's call it ProductionOrderSub). Apparently, I don't need to refactor the ProductionOrders class to use it to contain a collection of ProductionOrderSub objects. It accepts it because ProductionOrderSub is a ProductionOrder. Everything compiles just fine.<br /><br />Now I get to the UI and try to instantiate a SortedBindingList using my new subclass like this: <br />Dim mySBL as New SortedBindingList(Of ProductionOrders, ProductionOrderSub)<br /><br />The compiler complains that "Type argument 'ProductionOrders' does not inherit from or implement the constraint type 'System.Collections.generic.IList(Of ProductionOrderSub)"<br /><br />(I should also mention that I have my own subclasses of all three CSLA base classes. Not sure if it's pertinent.)<br /><br />Here's where I get pretty lost. Do I need to create a new collection class that only accepts my new subclass as a parameter? I'm obviously no expert in Generics and I feel quite confused.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, January 08, 2010</h2><P>SortedBindingList only takes one type parameter, not two.</P>
<P>SBL(Of T)&nbsp;is just a view over an IList(Of T) - and in both cases the T is the type of the item contained in the list.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
