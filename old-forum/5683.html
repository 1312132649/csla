One file gets generated once and the other gets regenerated every time the Database is changed.<br /><br />As I was working with the PropertyInfo on the Template, I realized that the I would want to manually edit the friendly name parameter in the PropertyInfo constructor, after the code is generated, but that declaration was going to get auto-generated constantly, and any manual changes I made, would get lost.  Is there any issue with having a static constructor in my business objects class, and updating any PropertyInfos that I needed to in that constructor by creating new PropertyInfos?  That way if I wanted to override them I could, but if I didn't need to, then I wouldn't have to.<br /><br />Are there any better ideas?  </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Fintanv replied on Tuesday, October 28, 2008</h2>I remove the setting of the friendly name from the code and use a resources file instead:<br>
<code>
<br>private static PropertyInfo MyDataProperty = RegisterProperty(new PropertyInfo("MyData", Properties.Resources.MyData));</code><br><br>Then you manage the resource files based on the location.<br>Would this work for you?<br><br>I am also curious as to what code generator you are targeting?<br>I have started using MyGeneration, creating the template using their C# engine, and love it.&nbsp; So far I have it creating the stored procedures, grants, and audit tables.&nbsp; Love the speed and consistency.<br><br>All the best.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dlabar replied on Tuesday, October 28, 2008</h2><P>Thats a good idea.&nbsp; I'll have to look into that.</P>
<P>I was using Code Smith, but it is a major pain to have to edit the templates.&nbsp; I'm also having to connect to an Oracle Database, so alot of the normal CSLA codesmith Templates require extra configuring.</P>
<P>I've decided to try to make my own using T4 in VS.&nbsp; I've never even looked at it before, but I'm tired of having to relay on third party software and not being able to have full control.</P>
