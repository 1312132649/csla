I am way overdue to upgrade. Already have the new csla 2.x book but now I need to upgrade visual studio. Google says they are about to release 2007. Does anyone know when it will be out as I hate to upgrade to 2005 if 2007 if right around the corner. </P>
<P>It doesn't sound like there will be much difference, so does that mean that there should be no big changes to csla. Upgrading my projects is just soooo much work and I hate to go to versions that are about to be obsolete.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, March 29, 2007</h2>I would definately get software assurance that would let you upgrade to 2007 when its out.<br><br>2007 simply lets you target .net 3, which includes WPF, WCF etc.&nbsp; So you'll have the tools built in.&nbsp; There are extensions to VS2005 for this, but I'm not sure if they will get any more updating..<br><br>I've played with WPF a bit, and its quite powerful for creating very cool interfaces.&nbsp; One of the things I like the most is that you can pretty much embed any control into any other control... so its easy to make a drop down that includings a mixutre of pictures, movies, text, other controls, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; That alone I think will be worth the investment to learn WPF, because I always feel limited by the Forms controls.. and I either have to spend lots of time building my own controls from scratch, or paying a bunch of money for prebuilt controls.<br><br>As far as Csla goes, there's some work that needs to be done to add WCF as a data portal channel, and other components to support data binding in WPF.&nbsp; But I have a feeling that it will be much easier to move from Csla 2.1.4 to 3 than from 1.1 to 2.1.4.. so I would go for it.<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jhw replied on Thursday, March 29, 2007</h2><P>Thanks Andy</P>
<P>I see that the msdn 2005 pro subscription includes the new 'orcas' (2007) edtition of visual studio. Looks like that is the way to go. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
