But the code in my Web project continues to generate an error that the object that I have moved into the new projects cannot be found.</p>
<p>I have the new projects referenced in the Web project.&nbsp; When I click on that reference, the Properties of the reference show that it is in the FrameLibrary.&nbsp; I have cleaned the solution and rebuilt it (many times), but the error persists.</p>
<p>Any ideas what I can do next.&nbsp; I would hate to use a blowtorch.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<p>I am probably not understanding it right.&nbsp; I thought one could place multiple pojects&#39; output in a single library using the AssemblyName in Properties windows.&nbsp; And since both projects are referenced in the Web project, the object references will be resolved.&nbsp; But my expectations may be wrong.</p>
<p>Jav</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>dlambert replied on Tuesday, February 09, 2010</h2><p>If I understand correctly, you&#39;re trying to combine the output of both projects into a single assembly (dll) - if I&#39;m reading this right, I believe that could be the problem. &nbsp;You can have two projects share a namespace, but each is going to have to have its own assembly name, and when you build your Web project, you should see both dll&#39;s in the bin folder.</p>
<p>I think you can combine assemblies with ILMerge, but I don&#39;t think the IDE is going to do this for you as part of a &quot;normal&quot; build, and it&#39;s probably more trouble than it&#39;s worth in most cases.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Tuesday, February 09, 2010</h2><p>Thanks for affirming - I should have known that in the first place.</p>
