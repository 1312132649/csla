<P>Does anyone has any suggestions how to displays the warnings in 2.1 (e.g. an "warning" provider similar to an error provider on a similar IDataError interface) or do I have to write a method to loop over the Brokenrules collections and trying to locate the binded controls to do something with them ? </P>
<P>Any suggestions are welcome...</P>

<P>Thx</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Saturday, October 21, 2006</h2><P>I think it's a great idea. I can imagine dragging an "ErrorWarningInfoProvider" on my form, set the DataSource and pick my icons.</P>
<P>Do you have any thoughts on how you would implement? I'm curious.</P>
<P>I started looking at this today, looking at the code of the ErrorProvider (via Reflector) to see if I could extend it somehow. It seems geared to a single Error. I'm not sure if extending it would work, but I don't know. Not that they have convienent overridable methods.</P>
<P>On the CSLA end, Core.BusinessBase implements IDataErrorInfo. That seems to be in line with the single Error string. It seems that the .NET types are not set up for more than just an error.</P>
<P>Just fishing for thoughts,</P>

<P>The Warning/Info stuff is great but how are you all using them in the UI?</P>
<P>Thanks in advance,</P>
