You could also use behaviors in SL 3.  I have not completely thought this through, but you can trigger animation off an event of VM.<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: ambreshgaur [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Monday, February 01, 2010 7:15 AM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] How can i use animation in MVVM<br /><br />I want to animate my message based on my previous action such as ...Saving a record or deleting a record .....how should i do that?<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ambreshgaur replied on Monday, February 01, 2010</h2>Pls give example code .....
