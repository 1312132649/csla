XtraScheduler is similar to a datagrid, just bind your BOs to it and use it's events to tigger changes in your objects.<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RedShiftZ replied on Tuesday, June 23, 2009</h2>Since the project I am working on is CSLA with XtraScheduler I can possibly help. After looking at samples from Marcelo Rojas among others I got it working. Let me see if I can throw together a sample real quick...<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RedShiftZ replied on Tuesday, June 23, 2009</h2>Here is a zip I threw together. This is a stripped down version of the code I am using.<br>It uses the following...<br><br>ADO Stored Procedures using TimeStamp fields for concurrency. (Not included, simple enough)<br>Partial classes for CSLA objects.<br>Managed Properties for CSLA objects.<br><br>Note: For some things (Resources), I have not implemented every property (images, etc) as I don't need them and they are not required.<br><br>I have not tested this exact code, but it is a subset of what I am currently using that does work just fine. Names and Locations have been changed to protect the innocent. :)<br><br>Let me know if you need any help with it.<br><br>Jeff Young<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
