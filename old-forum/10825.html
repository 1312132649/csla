<p>Individually both apps works great until we try to put the new SL app in use.&nbsp; The newer app has to work beside the older ASP.Net 2.0 app; and the user has to have both Apps (separate websites)&nbsp;available at the same time.&nbsp; The user also has to go from one app to the other.</p>
<p>Here is the problem: When the user leaves one app and does some work in the other, she get logged out of the previous app.&nbsp; Same thing happens in reverse.&nbsp; It looks like the identities in the two apps do not match.&nbsp; I do not think the new authentication system will work in the older app, and I would just hate to dismantle what I now have in the SL app.&nbsp; I am hoping there is some way to solve this pesky problem.</p>
<p>Both apps work off of the same set of databases.&nbsp; They both use the same Membership DB.&nbsp; I tried using separate Membership DBs but that did nothing.</p>

<p>SL is completely unaware of any of that, and relies on the browser to do all the work. It uses whatever cookies the browser has for the host site.</p>
<p>The principal used in SL is a standalone client thing. It is created by your code that runs to the server to create the principal/identity. But it has nothing to do with the browser, cookies, or the ongoing server identity for the user. This is because SL runs in a sandbox and is completely unaware of those things.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
