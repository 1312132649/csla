The book is largely about how CSLA is designed, with some coverage on how to use it. The videos are entirely about how to use CSLA to build apps.</P>
<P>The Core video series doesn't cover specific UX technologies, and so doesn't discuss things like MVVM - that'll be covered in subsequent videos targeting WPF, ASP.NET MVC, etc.</P>
<P>The Core video series covers business class implementation, data access, data portal, business/validation rules and authorization rules. Most or all of that content is in the book, and if you learn best by reading you are probably already set. But if you learn by listening and watching, the videos should be very valuable. Additionally, the videos come with very focused sample code showing the more narrow specific concepts being discussed in the videos - some people find this style of sample code easier to follow than the more complex demos like ProjectTracker.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
