Yet, right after the call to DoLogin you call ApplyAuthorizationRules again. So it's effectively being run twice. Is this a mistake or is there some reason you need to run it twice? <br><br>Thanks!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 12, 2008</h2>Yes, it looks like MainForm_Load() should only call ApplyAuthorizationRules() if the auth type is Windows.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
