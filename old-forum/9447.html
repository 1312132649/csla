<p><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">Download CSLA .NET</a></p>
<p>This is a bug fix release, with <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=ef41332f-16a2-441e-81d3-260403a196bf">important fixes</a> for some issues in version 4.0.0. If you are using CSLA 4, you should consider upgrading to 4.0.1 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please note that there are a couple potential breaking changes in 4.0.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using private backing fields, your RegisterProperty() calls must now specify Relationships.PrivateField so CSLA knows you are using a private backing field. If you don&#39;t do this, you&#39;ll get runtime exceptions.</li>
<li>The Save() and BeginSave() methods now raise different (and more reliable) exceptions. If you are explicitly checking for NotSupportedException you will need to check for InvalidOperationException.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I try to avoid adding breaking changes in point releases, these were important and I thought it better to get them out as early in the CSLA 4 life-cycle as possible.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
