Of course, if you use can writeproperty to enable/disable controls, you'll need the first one too.<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, October 03, 2006</h2>Wow, how did I miss that one?&nbsp; Guess I need more caffeine.<br><br>I'll override CanWriteProperty.<br><br>I don't want an empty setter, because the grid would still allow typing and the value just 'vanishes.'&nbsp; Not a great UI experience.&nbsp; CanWriteProperty can thrown an exception,but I'm not sure how the grid will react to that.&nbsp; Hopefully it will disabled editing in that cell..<br><br>Thanks for the quick answer!<br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
