<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I'm also kinda wondering why you want to print anything from there...</FONT></P>

I need to print on the server as My client would be at various location and they generate letters and need to auto print. but the print job has to be at a centralized location so felt that we need to do it in the remote server as that takes care of this scenario</P>

<P>First, make sure the user account under which your server code is running has access to the printer. I don't think the default IIS user can get to the printer?</P>
<P>Second, you may need to figure out a way to defeat any dialogs that would pop up. Obviously on the server no dialog can pop up, but perhaps this is blocking the thread, because the print API you are using is waiting for user input?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
