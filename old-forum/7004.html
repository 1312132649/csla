<P>If you are using 3.6.x, you should download and test this version. There are important bug fixes in this version - please see the change logs for details. If you are developing Silverlight, WPF or&nbsp;Windows Forms applications (in particular), you'll almost certainly want some of these fixes!</P>
<P>There are minor new features as well, including</P>
<UL>
<LI>Named connections in the GetManager methods for ConnectionManager and similar types 
<LI>ReadProperty() method in the ObjectFactory base class</LI></UL>
<P>But the primary focus is on fixing bugs and refining key usage scenarios.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, May 28, 2009</h2><P>I posted an updated <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">CSLA .NET for Windows</A> 3.6.3 download, which addresses a couple issues that came to my attention after the release on May 26.</P>
