<P>We have also started using the CSLA framework in our object.</P>
<P>I would like to clarify one doubt.</P>
<P>Could anybody please&nbsp;tell me when we have&nbsp;to use&nbsp;MarkDirty(). I have seen in lot of URLs like it has implemented immediately after invoking BrokenRules.CheckRules(). Why are we doing this.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, April 27, 2007</h2>You rarely need to call it yourself.&nbsp; Your property setters usually call it indirectly, because the PropertyHasChanged method will call MarkDirty (and run rules for the property).<br><br>Outside that, you would call it if your object has changed state and could be saved to the database (if its also valid) outside the normal property setters.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jags replied on Monday, April 30, 2007</h2><DIV class=ForumPostContentText id=ctl00_ctl01_bcr_ctl00___PostRepeater_ctl02_PostViewWrapper>Thanks a lot for giving me a wonderfull response Andy. </DIV>

<DIV class=ForumPostContentText><STRONG>Jags: </STRONG>Do we need to call PropertyHasChanged() method in the property setters?</DIV>

<DIV class=ForumPostContentText><STRONG>Jags: </STRONG>So MarkDirty() means, if the object has the change in its properties or values we need to set the object as dirty. It is not the case like if the object is invalid(failing a validation rule)&nbsp;we need to mark it as dirty.<BR><BR>HTH<BR>Andy<BR></DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, April 30, 2007</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/basicblue/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>Jags:</strong></div><div>Do we need to call PropertyHasChanged() method in the property setters?</div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>Yes.<br>
