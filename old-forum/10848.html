Actually, it&#39;s a method to verify whether a choosen architecture fits the requirements.&nbsp; In your case you would define scenarios, which are different with large customer, and then &quot;prove&quot; on paper if a target architecture is adequate. The good thing about this, is that you describe non-functional requirements is less ambiguous, than terms like &quot;scalable&quot;, &quot;more flexible&quot;. </p>
<p>On the technical side, here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>network traffic: in 3-tiers it&#39;s essential to have reasonable request/response packages. Too many small requests is bad, and very large responses are a problem, too. </li>
<li>Network latency (esp. VPN tunnel) </li>
<li>Is virtualization with Citrix or something similar an option (no distributed software update, no data transfer but screen transfers)</li>
<li>all objects involved in DataPortal calls have to be Serializable; types must be the same version; no hacks on the client accessing server ressources directly </li>
<li>security: which protocol are allowed, if using windows auth. restriction on multiple domains, signing your app, publish the certificate </li>
<li>Deployment / installation: what are dependet components (prerequisites), distribution channel, would clickonce do it </li>
<li>reliability and robustness (of the server part): if client crashes, the user can start it by himself, the server part is different</li>
</ul>
