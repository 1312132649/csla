However when I display the customer form I want to show the Type Description not the ID, but the binding should be to the TypeID behind the scenes. How is this done?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>brucep replied on Wednesday, November 15, 2006</h2><P>Lots of things you need to answer before you get an answer:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Are you showing the Type in a combo box on the Customer UI?</LI>
<LI>Is the Type another Root object in the system?</LI>
<LI>Can the customer Type be changed after the Customer is created or saved?</LI>
<LI>Does your Customer query join to&nbsp;return the Type description, or just the id?</LI>
<LI>Do you have any kind of persistent object registry for the Types?</LI></UL>
<P>If you answer these questions, you may get more help and suggestions.</P>

<P>The Type Is another Root Object but not in the Customer Object where it's only an Integer</P>
<P>The Type cannot be changed.</P>
<P>It does not join to get the description</P>
<P>I have a TypeList which is a NameValueList</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>brucep replied on Wednesday, November 15, 2006</h2><P>Excellent. I would say that ajj's suggestion is ideal.</P>
<P>--Bruce</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, November 15, 2006</h2>If its a read only object it would be acceptable to load the object from a view or stored procedure which fetchs the typename as well.&nbsp; But if you already have that data in memory, my first suggestion would have you fetching slightly less data.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, November 15, 2006</h2>One method would be to add a Type property to the customer, which uses your CustomerType class behind the scenes to translate the Id to a string.&nbsp; If you don't have a CustomerType (which has a static property List, which is a cached list of types, see the book for an example) class, make one by subclassing Csla.NameValueList.&nbsp; Your type property getter could then look like this:<br><br><font color="#0000ff">public string</font> Type {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">get </font>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <font color="#0000ff">return </font><font color="#006400">CustomerType</font>.List.Value( TypeId );<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>}<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>white911 replied on Wednesday, November 15, 2006</h2><P>Can I do it in the UI or it has to be done in the object?</P>
<P>In other words is the object responsible for retreiving the type description?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
