FKNationality<br />{<br />get { return GetProperty(FKNationalityProperty); }<br />set { SetProperty(FKNationalityProperty, value); }<br />}<br /><br />my ASPX dropdownlist properties look like this<br /><br />DropDownList ID="DropDownList3" runat="server" AppendDataBoundItems="True" <br />                                DataSourceID="DSNationalityList" DataTextField="Value" DataValueField="Key" <br />                                SelectedValue='# Bind("FKNationality")'<br />                                <br />asp:ListItem Text="Not Selected" Value=""<br /><br />When I inspect the e.Values I can see the GUID in there against FKNationality, it just doesn't put it to the object.<br />I have to do something like this to work around it and this works fine. <br /><br />Csla.Data.DataMapper.Map(e.Values, obj);<br />           if (e.Values["FKNationality"] != null)<br />            {<br />                obj.FKNationality = new Guid(e.Values["FKNationality"].ToString());<br />            }<br />            else<br />            {<br />                obj.FKNationality = null;<br />            }<br /><br />I have used the datamapper a few times now, each time it has worked perfectly. It may be something I am doing wrong but I cannot see it so far. <br />Is their any known issues I should be looking out for?<br />Sorry if there has already been a solution to this in the forum, I did a search and looked around but I couldn't find anything that matched my problem</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
