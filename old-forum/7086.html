Hopefully, the cause will be apparent at that point...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>flying_monkey replied on Thursday, June 11, 2009</h2>Unfortunately I am not and can't debug the application in the scenario where I am getting an error. The application I am building is a tool that updates a SQL database from a language called Blaise that doesn't have SQL connection capabilities but does support calling external DLL's. I am running a Blaise program that call's my DLL and updates about 50 cases in the SQL database.<br><br>If anyone knows how to debug a dll that is being called by an external program that would be great!<br><br>What did you mean by a local data portal? The setup I have is that my Visual Studio runs a test script which runs a blaise application on a server that my dll resides on as well which then updates a SQL database on a second server. All in all 3 computers...<br><br>Also, I am not completely sure about this but the problem only seems to happen when there is a large number of child objects for one parent object. Say around 8000+<br><br>Hopefully all this info will shed some light on any issues I am having.<br><br>Thanks<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>flying_monkey replied on Friday, June 12, 2009</h2>Here is the stack dump from the the exception I am receiving...Basically my work just renamed the CSLA to SADF I do not believe there are any differences in the two.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, June 12, 2009</h2>Actualy you should still be able to debug the assembly, even if it's called by a non-.net program.<br /><br />Since the program will have to host the CLR eventually, you can attach the debugger to the program using your assembly.  Make sure the assembly was compiled with Debug settings.  You should then be able to trace through your code.<br /><br />You may have to go into the Debug -> Modules menu and manually lose your PDB, by the way.<br /><br />HTH</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>flying_monkey replied on Friday, June 12, 2009</h2>I'm not sure how to do this... are you able to provide any more explanation?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, June 12, 2009</h2>Run the program, then go into VS with your assembly's solution loaded, then goto the Debug -> Attach to Process menu item.<br /><br />Look for the process which loads your assembly.  You can select it and attach there.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>flying_monkey replied on Friday, June 12, 2009</h2>Excellent, thank you very much. This will be helpful. Fortunately I have solved the error. It seems to have been caused by the Blaise application that was running. I was doing my tests against a new version. I switched to the older version and the bugs have gone away.<br><br>Thanks for all the help.<br><br>Dan King<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
