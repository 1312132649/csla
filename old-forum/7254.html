<P>This is the same code as 3.6.3, but builds with Silverlight 3.

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I&#8217;m not entirely sure of the answer to the question about
3.7 supporting SL2.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I <i>suspect</i> (but don&#8217;t know) that 3.7 will work with
SL2. I say this because I know Microsoft worked really hard to ensure backward
compatibility, so it seems likely. Unfortunately, I already upgraded my desktop
to SL3, so I don&#8217;t even have an SL2 machine where I can try 3.7 </span><span>L</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Thanks to Windows Update and Silverlight&#8217;s update, given a
few days there won&#8217;t be any SL2 runtimes out there anyway I suppose, so
it won&#8217;t really matter?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The only two things I did btw, are these:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>1. Change the System&#8230;Controls.Data.dll reference to be
non-version specific so it references the 3.0 DLL<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>2. Fix the WCF data portal reference to accommodate changes to WCF
in SL3<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So the answer is that if 3.7 works in SL2 today, then that&#8217;s
cool. If not, then you need to stick with 3.6.3 for a while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I was going to do a 3.7 with new features for SL 3, but
Microsoft released SL 3 much faster than I expected they would, and I&#8217;ve
been too busy with other work to add new features. Since SL3 is out, I think it
is critical that there be a version of CSLA that supports it, so I&#8217;m going
to release 3.7.0 as being &#8220;3.6 that builds in SL3&#8221;, and decide
where to go from there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
