Can anyone tell me that from the root of a virtual website, where files should be placed?&nbsp; I'm having to do a manual remote install which is complicating this process.&nbsp; Right now I have:</P>
<P>virtual root-<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -web.config<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -bin (directory)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-contents of my release directory from my app's build</P>
<P>I realize this is probably such a newbie question.&nbsp; But any help would be more than appreciated.</P>

<P>You also need to make sure the virtual root is an <EM>application</EM> within the context of IIS. That means it has the special little "application" icon in the IIS management console. That's a requirement of ASP.NET.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CSLABound replied on Thursday, June 28, 2007</h2><P>Thank you for confirming it.&nbsp; It is working beautifully.&nbsp; Thank you so much for creating the CSLA framework.</P>
