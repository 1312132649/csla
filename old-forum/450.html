What should happen is that each use case should have an object model, with objects defined to meet the needs of that use case.</P>
<P>Once that's done, and each object's responsibility has been defined within each use case, then you can see if you have duplicate responsibilities across use cases. That can help consolidate your objects together - just make sure you don't start warping the responsibilities to make them match. Either they match or they don't.</P>
<P>Once that's done, you can start to normalize behaviors, which will result in creating more objects - but ones that are primarily behavior-only, and really aren't focused on data so much at all.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
