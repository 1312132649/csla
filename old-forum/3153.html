However,&nbsp;in future&nbsp;i would like to use code generation to automatically create at least parts of the business objects for me. The problem is i dont know where to start, what tools to use, im at a dead end. I have heard about codesmith but havent a clue on howto use it.</P>
<P>Could someone kindly tell me which is the best code generation software to use for CSLA, and ideally point me in the direction of a&nbsp;tutorial on howto use it.</P>
<P>Many thanks in advance,</P>

I tried it recently with no prior experience and its is really easy. Just download CSLA Contrib (http://www.codeplex.com/CSLAcontrib) which contains templates that cover most of your scenarios and are easy to use and modify.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Philip replied on Thursday, July 19, 2007</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma>Try Code Complete .NET. I am pretty sure it will provide what you need. It has saved me days of development and it generates fully functional&nbsp;.NET three tier applications based on the CSLA.NET framework.</FONT></P>

I did remember seeing a short tutorial on Codesmith and CSLA a while back&nbsp;(downloading a free old version or something?) but i cant for the life of me remember it nor can i find a link in&nbsp;google (tried searching for the past 10 minutes but no luck).</P>
<P>I will try jumping in at the deep end but i always like to at least read a little before i take the plunge! Any links or even the url to the codesmith csla tutorial i remember would be very much appreciated.</P>
<P>Cheers</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>g18c replied on Saturday, July 07, 2007</h2>I just found the tutorial on <A href="http://www.onelittlevictory.com/">http://www.onelittlevictory.com/</A>. thanks for the advice.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RichMark replied on Friday, July 20, 2007</h2>I recently uploaded MyGeneration templates for CSharp.&nbsp; You might try them.&nbsp; I also uploaded a sample app for the Northwind database.&nbsp; These are&nbsp;available under CSLAContrib on Codeplex.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Monday, July 23, 2007</h2>You can also try CslaGenerator.<br>http://groups.google.com/group/CslaGenerator<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Friday, July 27, 2007</h2><P>Hi </P>
<P>I just downloaded CslaContrib, as I'm looking for some CodeSmith templates to produce Stored Procedures, and I find they have compile errors when started from CodeSmith Explorer 2.6. The BO's seem to be ok though.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
