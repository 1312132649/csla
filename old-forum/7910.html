The validation rules for the physical address are different from the mailing address. I created an Address class on which I set an AddressType field to differentiate between the two. How do I add business rules to the Address class that would differ between the two address types? Shared rules would not work.<br>Any help is much appreciated! Thank you.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Henrik replied on Thursday, October 29, 2009</h2>Create a validation rule method in the address class that branches on the address type, like in the example below:<br /><br />		private static bool RequireZipCode(T target, Csla.Validation.RuleArgs e) where T : Address<br />		{<br />			if (target.ReadProperty(AddressTypeProperty) == "Mailing")<br />			{<br />				//Rule for mailing address<br />			}<br />			else<br />			{<br />				//Rule for physical address<br />			}<br />			return true;<br />		}<br /><br />Cheers<br />/Henrik<br /><br />PS. How do I post formatted code?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>neste replied on Thursday, October 29, 2009</h2>Thanks for the tip, Henrik. I'll try that. <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
