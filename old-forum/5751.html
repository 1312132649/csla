<P>3.5 introduced managed fields/properties and the child data portal, which would require different templates to take advantage of. However, legacy style code should still work though -- I really didn't even have to change much to move to 3.5 except for the change to SaveItem() in EditableRootListBase.</P>
<P>There are also templates on Codeplex that may have been updated for 3.5, but I don't have a link.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
