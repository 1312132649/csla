The SL app then sets that culture on it's own thread so that all resources work the way they should. <br /><br />But when I make a call to the DataPortal the server side does not get the correct culture on the thread.<br /><br />Do i have to send the culture in the ClientContext and set it on the thread in the server? Or is there a better way to solve this?<br /><br />Tomas</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 24, 2009</h2><P>Right now that is what you'll need to do.</P>
<P>It seems to me we tried to flow the culture automatically in SL2 and had some trouble. I'll have to look at that again with SL3, as ideally the culture would flow automatically like it does in CSLA .NET for Windows.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
