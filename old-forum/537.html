<P>One huge plus I see right away aside from the speed improvements is the elimination of the infamous "TargetInvocationException" that drove me batty when I first started out with CSLA.</P>
<P>But will it work with remoting?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, July 05, 2006</h2>Well, its still using reflection (note the MethodInfo parameter), but its also using Emit to compile code in memory.&nbsp; I think this would be worth looking into, since reflection seems to be a gripe for some that are concerned about performance (even though db access takes much more time).<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 05, 2006</h2><P>A reader named Gareth Edwards emailed me with some details about optimizing reflection a couple weeks ago. Not only that, but in .NET 2.0 there's also a&nbsp;DynamicMethod object that can be used to speed up access to private fields - a lot!</P>
<P>I do think that for a future 2.x version it makes all the sense in the world to optimize the reflection using these concepts. I can imagine changing UndoableBase and speeding up n-level undo radically. Similarly, OnUnknownPropertyChanged could be optimized to cache its findings, etc.</P>
<P>Whether this ends up in 2.1 or something later I can't say. I would like to get the updated validation/authorization rules functionality done (along with filteredbindinglist) within the next few weeks. If I get that done and still have time to build/test the reflection changes I will - otherwise they'll have to come later.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Wednesday, July 05, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>

<P>Interesting.&nbsp; Hopefully once my current work load is down to a dull roar I can look at porting these changes back to the 1.x framework (under .net 2).&nbsp; We started with 1.x CSLA and now we have a large app released using it and after looking at all the changes in the 2.x framework it looks like it's way too risky and time consuming to re-write a working and released business object layer to work with the 2.x framework, but hopefully I can port some critical and useful changes back to it down the road.</P>
