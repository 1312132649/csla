<p>I was wondering whether the roadmap for the new Video-Series (for me most interestingly the segments about WPF and ASP.net MVC) is still correct? The roadmap currently states Q1 2010.</p>
<p>I was also wondering wheter you already know how the series will be priced.</p>
<p>Thanks Luzius</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 25, 2010</h2><p>No, I need to updated the roadmap.</p>
<p>The impending release of VS10 and .NET 4 and SL4 make this a bad time to release video or ebook content. If I produce content on VS08 and .NET 3.5 and SL3 it will have a lifespan of perhaps 2 months - which isn&#39;t good...</p>
<p>As I mentioned in another thread, I am very actively working on the XAML/MVVM video content - but have decided to produce it in March (or so) using a combination of VS08 and VS10. But I really can&#39;t do that video until there&#39;s at least a version of SL4 that works with VS10 RC.</p>
<p>In terms of ASP.NET MVC, CSLA 4 will have some nice support for working with MVC 2, and I&#39;d rather create content on that model, partially because MVC 2 is the new version, but more because CSLA 4 provides a much more compelling story around using MVC due to the new CslaModelBinder and Controller classes.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
