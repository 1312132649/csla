<P>Unfortunately, I placed the new version in a sub-directory of the old version.</P>
<P>I don't know how to fix it with the tools and/or permissions that I have.</P>
<P>Can you move the contents of CslaContrib\CSharp\CslaSrd\CslaSrd to CslaContrib\CSharp\CslaSrd?</P>
<P>Or let me know how?</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>
<P>PS - take a look at the public Rules property and BrokenRules property of RuleBusinessBase.</P>
<P>You can use an existing business object class&nbsp;to test it, just change references from Csla.Validation.CommonRules to CslaSrd.Validation.StdRules.</P>
<P>Of course, your custom rules won't have been coded with the error messages the same way I did it, but the standard rules should work as is.&nbsp; It's an easy fix to make custom rules compatible.</P>

<P>I'll contact a couple friends who know more about TFS and see what they suggest - but it appears to me that the answer is to </P>
<OL>
<LI>copy the files off somewhere safe</LI>
<LI>delete the errant directory from your working directory and TFS</LI>
<LI>copy the files to where they belong</LI>
<LI>add them back into TFS</LI></OL>
<P>Obviously this will lose any history. Let me see what others think.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, April 20, 2007</h2><P>Actually, looking at this a bit further - there are already files by those names in the target directory. So even if the Move option was available we'd be in trouble due to a conflict there.</P>
<P>I think you are going to have to delete those files and get your working directory in order, then re-add them, otherwise how are you going to merge any file changes and make sure the csproj file is correct, etc?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, April 24, 2007</h2><P>OK, got it figured out with some help from Brian Randell.</P>
<P>The deal is this: you can move folders and you can move single files. You can't move groups of files.</P>
<P>Obviously you can't move a folder into its parent, so moving folders won't help you here.</P>
<P>Instead, you'll have to move each file, one at a time. And while you are at it, the files that already exist in the parent directory are ones you can't <EM>move</EM>, because you need to merge the contents of the two files. You can do that in VS or a text editor or whatever.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, April 24, 2007</h2><P>Shoot, I didn't say <EM>how</EM> to move them.</P>
<P>In the Source Control Explorer you can right-click on a file and there's a Move menu option.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Friday, April 27, 2007</h2>Corrections to file placement made.&nbsp; Thanks!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
