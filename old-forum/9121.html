If I remember correctly, there&#39;s a new binding property you can set in the binding expression to get the desired behavior.</p>
<p>My understanding is that they weren&#39;t going to fix the issue outright, because that could cause backward compat issues. So instead they added some property you can set to tell binding to do the right thing.</p>
<p>(obviously I lost track of the details of that issue, or I&#39;d have a more definite/detailed answer...)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Wednesday, June 23, 2010</h2><p>I found a previous post with a link</p>

<p>Looks like this is taken care of with System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 23, 2010</h2><p>Oh good - so they did take the breaking change - kudos for them then!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
