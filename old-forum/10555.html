<p>However, if I don&#39;t do that but instead just click the Save button, which is wired up to the Save method in XAML via a trigger action (&lt;csla:TriggerAction TargetControl=&quot;{Binding ElementName=btnSave}&quot; MethodName=&quot;Save&quot;/&gt;), the Saved event never gets raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it supposed to?&nbsp; Or am I missing another way to respond to an object that was just saved?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
