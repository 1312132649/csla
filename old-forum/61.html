<DIV><SPAN>I am using CSLA 2.0. In VB.NET 2005. I have put a method in the factory method section, however when I try to reference it from the form, the method does not come up in the intelasense list. i.e. merrors. Function name in some class. but this function does not come up in the list. I did rebuild the library and forms and cleaned both, but nothing, What possible solutions are there for this problem. Thank you. </SPAN></DIV></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Chocolate, without your code it is almost impossible to know for sure. Are you certain the method is&nbsp;declared as public scope? How about the business class? Do you have the Shared keyword in the method declaration? Are other properties or methods visible from the form?&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>glenntoy replied on Monday, May 15, 2006</h2>I'm not quite sure if this would help. Go to solution properties--&gt;Choose configuration properities. Make sure all projects in the right pane has checked the Build column. If one of the projects has Build column uncheck. Check the project if it is the one that with the factory method you added.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Zagaaru replied on Tuesday, May 30, 2006</h2><P class=MsoNormal>I found a solution to this problem; sorry I took so long to reply. I decided to remove my dll library reference file from the&nbsp;solution. I then reloaded the dll library&nbsp;ref file back into the solution.&nbsp;Everything&nbsp;new method I added is now being recognized in the solution. I think it needed&nbsp;to be refreshed or something. Anyway,&nbsp;It works.&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;</P>
