This method uses a memorystream to write out the report. When I make this call (LocalReport.Render), it invokes the BusinessBase.OnDeserializedHandler. The BusinessBase is the base class for&nbsp;a custom identity class that implements IIdentity.&nbsp;The render method seems to be calling my Identity class to check security&nbsp;privileges&nbsp;and it fails with an error of &quot;That assembly does not allow partially trusted callers.&quot; in the call to AddBusinessRules. I&#39;ve signed all my assemblies, and added&nbsp;AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers to all projects. This method doesn&#39;t fail when called by other classes, only this rdlc/ReportViewer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any insights would be greatly appreciated.</p>
