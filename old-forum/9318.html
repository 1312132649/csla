Then replace the &quot;M&quot; in the examples with Csla. In terms of MVC and Csla working together, they work fine with no real issues from my experience. You will want to the use the CslaModelBinder if you want to take advantage of model binding (which you do).&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
