No Problems...</p>
<p>i.e &nbsp;<br />Person<br />PersonInfo<br />PersonInfoList<br /><br />Now we want to experiment using an editable root list. &nbsp;I thought I could just load the editable root list collection with my existing Person object, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be working. &nbsp;It fails when the item is being added saying it can&#39;t be added since it&#39;s not marked as a child.</p>
<p>Can someone please help me out... I&#39;m sure it&#39;s simple, but I&#39;m scatterbrain at the moment :)&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, January 12, 2012</h2><p>Generally speaking EditableRootLists have been in many respects discouraged&nbsp;(there are some cases where it can make sense)&nbsp;- I suppose it depends on how much information you have on each person and how much you intend to display when listing people.</p>
<p>Is there a particular motivation towards moving towards an editable root list?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had a case where adding/editing/etc items off a read-only list leveraged an editable object and then modified the underlying readonlylist through refreshes of particular items or additions of new info items &amp; such - perhaps that would be a better avenue.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, January 13, 2012</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Obviously your Person object is a &quot;root&quot; object. </p>
<p>As such you can use it in a DynamicList object that will work much like the datagrid in SqlServer management studio and automatically save the changes when you move to another object in the list. </p>
<p>If you want to use Person in EditableRootList it can only be a &quot;child&quot; object that can only do Save/Delete in the context of a Save on the entire EditableRootList object.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>reagan123 replied on Friday, January 13, 2012</h2><p>Thanks for the replies.&nbsp; I&#39;ll elaborate my actual use case a bit to see if you guys have any good suggestions.</p>
<p>The idea is that I need to display a list of inspections to the user, such as &quot;Check Oil in Car&quot;.&nbsp; This list has a child collection of schedules stating how often the inspection is due, such as &quot;Every 3,000 miles&quot; or &quot;Every 3 months&quot;.</p>
<p>What i&#39;m trying to do is to display this to the user.&nbsp; The user needs to be able to edit both the Inspection information and the scedule information.&nbsp; How would you guys model your objects for this?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks for the responses so far.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Friday, January 13, 2012</h2><p>The scenario you explain would work if you list your schedules as a EditableChildList&nbsp; with the Person being an EditableRootList.&nbsp; If you need to edit Schedules all by themselves outside the context of Person, you could make them switchable, which are essentially objects that have logic for both Root and Child.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
