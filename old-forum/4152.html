You can then program your DataPortal_Update or DataPortal_Insert method to connect to SQL database and insert the records. The biggest issue you <i>may</i> run into is mapping any form of foreign keys.<br><br>This actually has given me a different look at doing a simple import. Will eagerly see if others point out any potentional reasons for <b>not </b>doing this.<br><br>John<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Friday, January 11, 2008</h2><P>I do stuff like this all the time for importing data from text files or Excel spreadsheets or external databases. I like the idea that the BO gets "filled in" and then validated for each record and then can be saved to my real DB. If a record is invalid, the fact is logged and then the next row is imported anyway. This gets the majority of the "good data" out of the file and into the DB. Then the user can review the log for exceptions and only re-submit those records in a new file.</P>
