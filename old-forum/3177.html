<P>in my app i need to implement insert and delete functionality, the app uses both the binding source and local code objects (dim x as datalist)</P>
<P>My problem at the moment is how to effectively implement insert and delete. the documentation states that when i do .Save if .isdeleted or .isnew is not set then an update an occurs.</P>
<P>Exactly where does .isdeleted or .isnew get set ? do i need to create a property in my object and then set the properties before caling .save.</P>
<P>i need to implement this using both a form binding source and local code objects</P>

If you use the DataPortal.Fetchmethod, it marks the object as old, so IsNew will be false.<br><br>.IsDeleted is also a read-only property, and is automatically handled when you use the delete techniques as described in the book.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
