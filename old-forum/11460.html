<p>One of the things I&#39;m seeing in the defalt code when creating a new page in the project is that it assumes you&#39;re going to wire up the data and manually bind it to the collection view source via code.&nbsp; The comments provided in the LoadState method in the code-behind even speaks to that.&nbsp; Is this the preferred route now?&nbsp; Or is&nbsp;Microsoft just providing one possible way of doing it to get someone started?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I follow a normal MVVM path to hooking up the view and viewmodel?&nbsp; Any differences that I need be aware of?&nbsp; </p>
<p>One other quick question:&nbsp; the page templates that are provided (like the &quot;Items Page&quot; template) all seem to use a static resource for a grid&#39;s ItemSource that assumes the elements are binding to properties like &quot;Title,&quot; &quot;SubTitle,&quot; etc.&nbsp; Is this also just a MS-example?&nbsp; Or are we supposed to force our objects&#39; properties into this mold?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, July 08, 2012</h2><p>I don&#39;t know the answer to this question yet.</p>
<p>Thus far I have been using the Microsoft templates, viewmodel objects, and a little code-behind to handle things like navigation and setting each form&#39;s datacontext. Not &quot;pure&quot; MVVM by any means, but very workable.</p>
<p>I have been focused on getting CSLA itself working with async/await and WinRT, and haven&#39;t spent any real time thinking about UI framework issues.</p>
<p>I know the MVVM Light and Caliburn Micro projects have put effort into the UI issues, and I think there&#39;s already an MVVM Light for WinRT.</p>
<p>What I don&#39;t know is whether their approaches are compatible with Microsoft&#39;s item templates. I&#39;d sure hate to lose the ability to use those templates, because they do a lot of the basic work necessary to get standard transitions and animations set up correctly.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Monday, July 09, 2012</h2><p>Thanks for the info.&nbsp; So in the way that you&#39;re currently doing it, do you have one main view/page with a content control, in which you inject the sub-views when navigating?&nbsp; Or are you doing it like what their templates show, where each page is unto itself?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
