We also have a child object Customer Addresses which derives from BusinessBase class. We are loading both these objects using Nhibernate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we get the Customer object with Customer address object as child objects. But changes in customer address object does not make the Customer object dirty. Do we need to use the FieldManager to check if the customer address object exist, if not use SetProperty / LoadProperty to set the customer address object to the customer address object within customer object.</P>
<P>Any other ideas??</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
