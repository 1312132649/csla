I have an existing xsd file that I can use xsd.exe to generate a normal .net class. As Rocky outlines in Chapter 11, this would be good for generating DTO's; but I would also like to use it to generate the business method properties section of my BusinessBase objects. This would give me a good start on the&nbsp;class without having to copy all the properties and add the specific CSLA requirments manually. Does anyone have any good code generation templates for such a thing?? </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, December 06, 2007</h2><P>Before we moved away from code generation we were generating classes using XML - basing it off Ricky Supit's CodeSmith templates and making some modifications to allow for inheritance and certain other attributes &amp; properties. </P>
<P>So you might think about looking at those to give you some direction if you're open to other generation methods. </P>
