<P>If I use simple control without much styles or instead use a simple image in the element, then scrolling goes fine and application performance is good. </P>
<P>However, if I load the control with heavy WPF styles,then at very high resolution say (1400 * 900) systems, scrolling gets jerky and CPU usage increases.The problem exists with machines with low graphic card.</P>
<P>I studied this and found that WPF can take advantage of hardware rendering pipeline but couldn't find any working example.</P>
<P>Is there some way in WPF by which we can use heavy styled xaml controls with good performance on&nbsp; PCs with UMA graphic card?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
