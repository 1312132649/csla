I then wish to create a list(displayed via datagridview) of these publishers for the user and allow the user to update, delete and insert. I don't know if this should be a CSLAEditableRootList or a CSLAEditableChildList ? How do I figure out which this list should be?<br><br>Its not clear to me differences are between the two.<br><br>Any help would be appreciated.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Tuesday, January 02, 2007</h2><P>The answer really depends on how you are going to use the object.&nbsp; I believe you want a CSLAEditableRootList.&nbsp;&nbsp; A editable root list will allow you to retrieve a&nbsp;collection of publishers that you add, edit, and delete items.&nbsp; Then you can save them all at once.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>You could also use a read-only list so the user can find the publisher they want to edit and then fetch a single EditableRoot Publisher object to edit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I generally use the read-only lists in search windows where&nbsp;it is not practical or performant to load several thousand fat objects.&nbsp; I'll create a list that just has the essential properties for searching.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
