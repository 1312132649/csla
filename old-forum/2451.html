<P><BR>Scenario:<BR>Ability to fetch the customer object or a collection of customers in both readOnly and Editable mode</P>
<P><BR>In some part of the system both the object and the collections are readOnly and in some part of the system are fully editable.<BR>Also in some parts of the system I would need a NameValueList in some other I would use a different collection for performance reasons.<BR>This are hypotetical scenarios but very very common.</P>
<P>How do I build in this flexbility?</P>
<P>Do I create a class for each of them?</P>
<P>like:<BR>Customer (fully Editable Object)<BR>CustomerListInfo(ReadOnly Object)<BR>CustomerListReadOnly (ReadOnly)<BR>CustomerList(fully Editable)</P>
<P><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Serializable]&nbsp; //Full Editable Object<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public class Customer : BusinessBase&lt;Customer&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Serializable] //ReadOnly Version<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public class CustomerListReadOnly : ReadOnlyListBase&lt;CustomerList, CustomerListInfo&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Serializable]&nbsp; //ReadOnly<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public class CustomerListInfo : ReadOnlyBase&lt;CustomerListInfo&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</P>
<P><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Serializable&nbsp; //Full Editable Customer List Object<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public class CustomerList: BusinessListBase&lt;CustomerList, Customer&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</P>
<P><BR>IS THIS THE WAY? or Am i missing something?Obviosly is not possible to have an overload of the Fetch Method is it?<BR>Also important is the Criteria class ,Is this used as filter?<BR>Are there somewhere some more complex example that I can dowload to understand how to use it more complex scenarios?</P>
<P><BR>Looking at the forum and on the net it looks like there are a lot of CSLA users out there.</P>
<P>From a CLSA Beginner point of view it would be nice if people could upload small apps/tutorials they have done.<BR>Nothing wrong with the project tracker app ,but sometimes a different example does the trick and all becomes clear.</P>
<P>Is somebody willing to send me a small app/example they have done during their learning process?</P>
<P>thanks a lot<BR><A href="mailto:dotnet@devnet247.com">dotnet@devnet247.com</A><BR></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hurcane replied on Thursday, March 01, 2007</h2>Rocky always advises designing your objects on behavior rather than data. The use case that needs an editable customer should have an editable customer object. the use case for a read-only customer should have an object for that case, which would not be an editable customer. <br /><br />Most of us start out wanting to model data because that is our comfort zone. You may want to here a customer info object with lots of properties. This works well when showing properties for a single customer, such as an Enter Order use case. <br /><br />You may try to use the same object for a customer lookup use case, but performance is terrible. Then you make a more focused customer info object for that use case. <br /><br />The goal is not reuse of database  code.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dotnetbrix replied on Thursday, March 01, 2007</h2><P>Thank you for your reply.I thought that was the case that is why i posted the small examples.I agree.</P>
<P>I just needed confirmation .</P>
<P>Are there any examples somewhere to download apart from projectTracker ?</P>
