Is there any reason for this?</p>
<p>Has anyone got server-side paging, sorting and grouping working with a 3-tier Silverlight application?</p>

I&#39;m not aware of any formal concept in SL3 either - though I may have missed it?</p>
<p>IReportTotalRowCount is part of a broader solution for paging that integrates with the Web Forms 2.0 paging model, which is why it exists. Since Web Forms doesn&#39;t run inside Silverlight it didn&#39;t make sense to support that interface.</p>
<p>How does Telerik handle paging?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, March 05, 2010</h2><p>I put together a small sample showing a couple paging approaches for use in Silverlight (or WPF).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslacvs/viewvc.cgi/core/trunk/Samples/CslaLight/cs/PagedList/">http://www.lhotka.net/cslacvs/viewvc.cgi/core/trunk/Samples/CslaLight/cs/PagedList/</a></p>
<p>The code is based on CSLA 4, so it won&#39;t <em>directly</em> work in 3.8, but I think the only thing that needs changing for 3.8 would be the PagedCriteria class (the property declarations won&#39;t work in 3.8).</p>
<p>But the overall concept and approach is consistent with what you&#39;d expect to see for any smart client scenario - Silverlight, WPF or even Windows Forms.</p>
<p>The sample shows an automatic technique and a manual technique.</p>
<p>The automatic technique has the collection&#39;s factory method retrieve the first page of data, and then start an async load of subsequent pages one at a time. Each subsequent page is merged into the existing collection as it arrives. The async data portal ensures that the callback occurs on the UI thread, so this is pretty easy stuff. This technique is good if the user typically uses the whole list, but you don&#39;t want them to wait while it is retreived.</p>
<p>The manual technique is similar, but requires that the UI request the next page. This technique is good if the user typically doesn&#39;t use the whole list, because you don&#39;t waste the time loading everything unless the user actually wants to use it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure there are many other variations on the concept - but this sample should be enough to get most people started with basic async paged loading of a BLB.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Thursday, August 26, 2010</h2><p>Hi Rocky,</p>

<p>this is still an issue for me.</p>
<p>I am running the PagedList sample out of the box and get the same exception.</p>
<p>Model == null in OnRefreshed...</p>
<p>I am just starting with Silverlight, so I strongly assume that there is just a little piece of knowledge missing on my part.</p>
<p>It feels like a missing piece between client and server.</p>
<p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>stefan replied on Wednesday, January 12, 2011</h2><p>Solved: Just have to navigate to the right .html or .aspx page in the browser. I knew it was so simple.</p>
<p>Somehow expected that the sample would open with the right page. </p>
<p>But this way we have both an .html and a .aspx sample page...</p>
