Clearly the MIME types haven't been properly added to IIS.</P>
<P>You should either do a repair of your VS/.NET install, or run the command line utility to re-install ASP.NET into IIS. That second option is where I'd start - though I never remember the name of that utility app (asp_iisinstall.exe or something).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pillesoft replied on Thursday, September 04, 2008</h2>thank you Rocky,<br><br>your proposal was working. removed .net3 sp1, and .net2x<br>installed them again<br>execute aspnet_regiis -i<br>and ptweb working when wcfhost is hosted in iis<br><br>Ivan<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
