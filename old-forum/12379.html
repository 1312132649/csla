<p>recently, I still read about angularJS, and I interested with that approach ( for me it&#39;s like XAML on WEB ).</p>
<p>currently I develop LOB app in SL and WPF. and for greater reach then I intend to try web based ( HTML ) with angularJS.</p>
<p>So, my questions is :</p>
<p>1. in this situation , Do I must develop with SOA architecture ( from Rocky ebook ) where</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; edge app is angularjs app which REQUEST to service app with CSLA for implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this means : at least two ducplicate business logic in JS ( angularjs )&nbsp; and in the service ( CSLA BO ) which is for Rocky , he said that this is not duplication but it&#39;s actually two different app ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any suggestion, examples, article , opinion are welcome</p>
<p>thank a lot for any comments too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to decide which business rules you&#39;re re-implement on the client, or which rules might need specific service calls to help the client. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>sergeyb replied on Friday, February 14, 2014</h2><p>This is the route I am going right now, taking on a big re-write of a SL app. &nbsp;We are adding a Web Api layer with models that we generate based on CSLA objects once, then modify to fix the web model a bit better. &nbsp;We are implementing some standard rules, like required, min / max, regEx, etc... as Angular directives. &nbsp;Then we decorate Api models with attributes that we scrub when generating angular views (MVC partial views in our case) and inject appropriate directives. &nbsp;I think we can implement all standard cross-object rules this way. &nbsp;When it comes to specific rules, we are making the decision based on effort required. &nbsp;If effort is super large, we are skipping those directives short term. &nbsp;Long term, we will got back and fill those in as well.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Monday, August 18, 2014</h2><p>Hello Sergeyb if you don&#39;t mind I&#39;d be very interested in how you implemented authentication. &nbsp;It seems that the Web Api doesn&#39;t seem to play well with how CSLA sets the business principal.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jteneglio replied on Tuesday, August 19, 2014</h2><p>I&#39;m having a similar issue with Authentication and CSLA using WebAPI 2, at the moment I&#39;m hard coding the authentication on every calls but i would like to see it work properly :-0&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>yanet.morales replied on Tuesday, May 12, 2015</h2><p>Hi Jean,</p>
<p>I have the same problem with the Authentication, could you please tell me how to fix it if you resolved this situation.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
