<P>Basically, I have a child Department object to handle adding/deleting/updating a Department in a project.&nbsp; This Department object has three distinct child collections of Drawing, Category, and Qualification objects.&nbsp; The errors I'm encountering are showing up in the Update method in the collection object itself; in other words, for Drawing, it's showing up in the Update method for the Drawings object.&nbsp; Typical code is as follows:</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>&nbsp; &nbsp;private void Update(SqlTransaction tr, Department parent)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RaiseListChangedEvents = false;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach(Drawing deletedChild in DeletedList)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deletedChild.DeleteSelf(tr);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DeletedList.Clear();</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach(Drawing child in this)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (child.IsNew)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; child.Insert(tr, parent);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; child.Update(tr, parent);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RaiseListChangedEvents = true;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</FONT></P>
<P>The errors are getting thrown in the child.Insert and child.Update steps.&nbsp; The error message I'm getting is:</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Argument '2': Cannot convert from 'Library.Department' to 'Library.Drawings'</FONT></P>
<P>I've been staring at it for so long...switching from the Department object to the Drawings object to the individual Drawing objects...but I can't find what's causing this compile-time error to be thrown.&nbsp; Is there any specific place I should check?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, August 10, 2006</h2>What does the Drawing.Update() method look like? Specifically, what type does it expect 'parent' to be? Given this code, 'parent' would need to be of type Department in the Drawing.Update() method.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>albruan replied on Thursday, August 10, 2006</h2>Thanks, Rocky!&nbsp; You're a lifesaver!&nbsp; The heat down here must be getting to me &lt;g&gt;, even though it hasn't been as hot here as it was up there in MN last week.&nbsp; Anyway, I was telling the&nbsp;Drawings&nbsp;object that&nbsp;its parent was the Department object and I was telling the Drawing object that it's parent was the Drawings object.&nbsp; Everything is working super now.&nbsp; Thanks again!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
