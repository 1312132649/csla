<p>All of this made me wonder if this sort of paradigm could replace what CSLA does for us. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been using CSLA for years, but I haven&#39;t developed an Entity Framework application yet. &nbsp;What sort of things would I be missing out on?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Friday, February 25, 2011</h2><p>This has been discussed a few times on the forum, and a search will pull up&nbsp;quite a bit of&nbsp;information.&nbsp; But the short answer is &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>EF is an ORM, and as such is not really designed to develop the kind of rich business objects that CSLA provides.&nbsp; For one, there isn&#39;t any integrated business-rule subsystem, nor is there much in the way of authorization rules either.&nbsp; There&#39;s also no infrastructure for object graphs (e.g. child dirty detection).&nbsp; This isn&#39;t all that it&#39;s missing, but these are pretty decent chunks of functionality.&nbsp; But like I said, it&#39;s an ORM, and most people don&#39;t consider those types of things to be the purview of an ORM.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how old&nbsp;that video series is, but from what you&#39;ve described, it sounds like it&#39;s actually a lot closer to WCF RIA Services.&nbsp; This accomplishes some of what CSLA does, and possibly over time could replicate much of what CSLA does for Silverlight, but it does so in a different fashion.&nbsp; And RIA Services is (currently) restricted only to Silverlight (and, I would presume, WP7), while CSLA isn&#39;t.&nbsp; RIA Services also takes a very different view on what your model should look like, which is why CSLA and RIA Services don&#39;t really play well together either.</p>
<p>HTH</p>
