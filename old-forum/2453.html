<p>I have been creating one of EditableBusinessBase classes, working good. I basically have private variables like</p>
<p>Guid _id;<br>string _propertyName = string.empty;<br>int _plotSize;</p>
<p>Do i need to initialise _plotSize to a number? I know i have to with strings, as it states in the book because it doesn't bind if its null but what about a number?<br></p>
<p>Then my other question is with regards to a property on a businessBase class. I have various public properties (get/set) like this which show the contents of the private members like _id, _propertyName etc etc<br></p>

<p>public string PropertyName<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get {....}<br>.<br>.<br></p><p>All fine and now i need another property (get/set) that will&nbsp;be "Property
Type" which will contain things like "house", "office", "farm house",
"land", "apartment" etc.. so I presume i need to create another
BusinessEditableBase for property types this i am ok with... but then
how do i create the property on my original EditableBase class above, i
could put</p>
<p>private MyNewEditableBase.PropertyTypes _propertyTypes; // But this is tightly coupled isn't it?<br><br>public MyNewEditableBase.PropertyTypes PropertyTypes<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; get{ ..}<br>.<br>.<br></p><p>But this would tightly couple the 2 objects wouldn't it?? And the other question that i keep thinking about when reading other parts of Rocky's book is that yes i do need a EditableBase for this propertyType as i need to Edit / Add records but i presume when I will use it from another BussinessObject then I would use a ReadOnlyList as it acting like an ENUM - is this correct?<br></p>
<p>I don't think i need some kind of Assignment type object like in the
csla.net book as its only a 1 to 1 relationship... It is a real
estate(property) record and one the of fields/properties on the object
will be of a type "MyNewEditableBase" o similar.<br></p>
<p>As you can see, I am a little lost, can anyone give me a little input.</p>Thanks in advance<br><br>Ian<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ianinspain replied on Thursday, March 01, 2007</h2>I thought i also might put this comment here to ensure i have explained it correctly.<br><br>In simple terms if this "PropertyType" (real estate type) could be of type enum i.e.<br><br>enum <br>{<br>house,<br>apartment,<br>office<br>}<br><br>but of course it something that isn't fixed so it needs to work with the framework to allow the options that are available to PropertyType to be updated etc<br><br>I hope i have explained it well enough for someone to jump in and give a little feedback..<br><br>Thanks once again<br><br>ian<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, March 01, 2007</h2><P>You can have an editable root directly contain an editable child, that is fine. The property in the editable root that allows access to the child should be a read-only property, because you don't want the UI to change that reference, only gain access to the child object.</P>
<P>The idea of containment (or aggregation) is at the core of object-oriented design. Objects contain other objects all the time, this is not a bad thing. In fact, it is a way to express important relationships between objects.</P>
<P>In most cases this is not a form of tight coupling. The root object is aware of its child, but probably won't interact with it very much. The child object may be entirely unaware of its parent.</P>
<P>Regarding your list of property types, this is the purpose behind NameValueListBase. You can use NVLB to create an object that represents a list of name/value pairs, typically loaded from the database or a configuration file.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ianinspain replied on Thursday, March 08, 2007</h2>Wow Rocky!, the penny just dropped... reading over the book again and your explanations has really hit the point.... Thanks for the explanations.... i was so close but was missing that little bit of confirmation..<br><br>Thanks once again!<br><br>I am sure i will be back later with the odd few questions, things are really moving now..<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Ian<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
