This means that my GridView can't bind to the object at design time, making it tedious to set up gridviews.<br><br>Even if I manually provide the business object type, the GridView still will not pick up the fields at design time.<br><br>This is a relatively new problem<br><br>I'm using v3.5 of CSLA, within VS2008, on a .NET 3.5 project.<br><br>The project did start out using CSLA v2.0 in a .NET 2.0 project.<br><br>Any ideas why my business objects are not showing?<br><br>Will<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 17, 2008</h2>Sometimes Visual Studio gets confused - gets some corruption in the temp folders, etc. You may try flushing the various caches - the obj and bin folders, and the temporary VS web folders.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>robertoConzentra replied on Thursday, March 05, 2009</h2>i have the same problem, but it's not connected to a csla datasource, is connected with all datasources.. simply they cannot see csla inheritated object.<br>the curios think is that if you put a normal object data source you can find the base csla class and bind them, but still you cannot see your business library!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>robertoConzentra replied on Friday, March 06, 2009</h2>just one explication, if i delete obj directory object datasource see the csla objects, but still csladatasource don't work. i think is a problem of vs2008 designer with assembies referenced, but i don't find the problem till now.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Sunday, March 08, 2009</h2>It might be your business assembly is exposing a type from an assembly not referenced by the UI project.&nbsp; I've had this happen when my business layer was inadvertently exposing my data assembly.. and the UI had no reference to the data layer.&nbsp; Once I resolved this, VS behaved normally.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>robertoConzentra replied on Monday, March 09, 2009</h2>No, i already think that was a problem of references, but is not.<br>I try with Csla sample, and the problem persist with example of Lhotka too, if a open a page the csla datasource is not showing the b.o., is showing nothing! i'm relative sure that lhotka knows how make examples of his product.<br>it seems to be a bug in Vs2008 designer (if i run the examples of my code it's work perfectly, it's only a problem of design!).. not all the developers workstation do it, only the last updated.. i think is a problem of some environments, the problem is that is not so simple to understand what was wrong, and i can't update nothing untill i find the problem, those installation have many ides (blend expression, sql2008, many plug-ins and others..), perhaps is a problem doo to this.<br>i will post the solution if i find what is wrong in those developers workstations<br>thanks<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
