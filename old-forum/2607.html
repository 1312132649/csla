I am trying to get the 2.1 framework installed and compiled.</P>
<P>When I open the clsacs solution I get the following message <FONT color=#ff0000>"The project location is not trusted: {full path where project exists}&nbsp;&nbsp; Running the application may result in security exceptions when it attempts to perform actions which require full trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK to ignore and continue."</FONT> I seems to compile fine, but I get similar messages for several projects when attempting to open the Project Tracker sample application.</P>
<P>I am not familar with setting FullTrust permissions to applications. I have Rocky's install document, but it doesn't tell me how to set up the FullTrust. I haven't been able to find anything that makes it clear to me how to go about doing this. Can anyone help me or point me to good documentation?</P>
<P>I am interested in initially getting the CLSA and the Project Tracker application working, but also what are the best practices for this when deploying my own applications into production environments.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Thursday, March 29, 2007</h2><P>I believe the last time I got this behavior I had just downloaded a new version of the framework.</P>
<P>Courtesy of all the paranoia about files from other computers, there is now a need to "Unblock" the file so that its contents are given due respect.</P>
<P>If this is what caused your problem, your fix is pretty easy.&nbsp; First, blow away the CSLA folder you currently have and make a new empty one.&nbsp; Then, using Windoze Explorer,&nbsp;find the .zip file you used to populate it last time.&nbsp; Right click on it and choose Properties.&nbsp; You'll see the Unblock button at the bottom of dialog.&nbsp; After unblocking, you should be able to unzip the contents as you did before, but you shouldn't see any more warnings about it being untrusted when you reference the project folder in a VS solution.</P>
<P>Of course, if this ISN'T what caused your problem, you just wasted five minutes.&nbsp; Oh well.</P>
<P>Hope this helps.</P>

Funny I had never had this type of problem befoe with programs from a .zip file.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, April 03, 2007</h2>Its a new feature of IE.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/SometimesSecurityHelpersHelpTooMuch.aspx">Rocky's blog</a> on the topic.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Friday, March 30, 2007</h2><P>You should be able to find your solution here <A href="http://www.acthompson.net/DotNet/setting_a_trusted_location.htm">http://www.acthompson.net/DotNet/setting_a_trusted_location.htm</A></P>
<P>The issue is that the directory you have the project in is not trusted by the .net framework.&nbsp; The link above shows how to set it as trusted.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, March 30, 2007</h2>I think checking out the zip file would be worth attempting though as well, because that would cause the same problems even on the local disk, which already has full trust.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
