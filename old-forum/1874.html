<P>I think I'm officially abandoning them and going back to the DevExpres Xtra Reports.&nbsp; (Even though the Xtra Reports has its limitations, they are more in the area of developer efficiency than in how it works.)</P>
<P>First off, I think the rdlc designer/viewer was a great idea and version 2&nbsp;may&nbsp;be be a&nbsp;very good tool - which is to say this is a classic version 1 Microsoft product, if ya know what I mean.&nbsp; I believe most of its limitations and issue have something to do with the fact that it is some kind of port of the SQL Reporting Services technology.&nbsp; While that is a great idea, that paradigm&nbsp;has some&nbsp;breakdowns in a windows forms environment.</P>
<P>There's the issue of DataSources.&nbsp; The SQL version of this technology includes the query definition... that is the data source is part of the report definition.&nbsp; In the rdlc version you supply it the data sources.&nbsp; Now, the VS developers tried to make it support the powerful BindingSource paradigm like in Windows Forms development, but it doesn't quite work.&nbsp; It turns out the report definition has its own data sources, which are linked but not the same thing as the BindingSource data sources used when it runs.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So you have an extra layer of abstraction there which introduces some synchronizazion issues as you'd expect.&nbsp; Not anything that doesn't work or works "wrong" per se, but there's some stuff you have to do manually that you don't think about in Forms design.&nbsp; One of the aspects of that is if you're designing a form you can have the BindingSource components all related to each other by pointing one's DataSource to a property of the data source of another.&nbsp; At runtime you only have to give the root BindingSource a "real" data object.&nbsp; Not so with reports - you have to explicitly give each BindingSource it's data source at runtime.</P>
<P>Secondly, I've experienced some oddities in the rendering.&nbsp; Basically there are fairly drastic inconsistencies between the way the report looks in the designer, the viewer in "normal" mode, the viewer in print layout mode, and when actually printed.</P>
<P>One of them is that in some cases the left edges of text is "clipped" in the viewer.&nbsp; It looks as if the containing textbox is crowding in on the actual text and covering the left edge of the first character.&nbsp;For certain characters it is rather difficult to discern what it's supposed to be.&nbsp; Everything looks perfectly fine when printing though.</P>
<P>The more drastic problem is with textboxes with borders.&nbsp; Everything looks fine in the viewer if in print layout view and when printed.&nbsp; But in the normal/default viewing mode the text inside the textbox is in two rows such that nothing is really readable.&nbsp; I don't have the textbox set to AutoGrow since that would interfere with the graphical aspect of the layout.</P>
<P>You have to imagine this scene - I design the report and everything looks perfect.&nbsp; I run the app and call up the report and the layout is wacked.&nbsp; I switch to print layout mode in the viewer and the layout looks right but there's still that clipping.&nbsp; I print the thing and it looks perfect as in the designer.&nbsp; Is it just me or is that utterly ridiculous?</P>
<P>If I'm understanding the newsgroup response correctly, this is due to the fact that the default view mode is actually a pure HTML translation and rendering.&nbsp; One of the suggestions was not to use freeform placement but keep everything in tables since that works better in HTML.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp; I think it's pure nonsense to have a windows form report writer that's constrained by having to work in the paradigm of HTML tables.</P>
<P>So, I'm very close to making the decision to going back to Xtra Reports as the report writer standard here.&nbsp; I know I can't live with these rdlc rendering/viewing limitations.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, November 30, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/basicblue/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>DansDreams:</strong></div><div>First off, I think the rdlc designer/viewer was a great idea and

<P>To be clear (and not just to argue), I'm talking about the extra understanding you&nbsp;must&nbsp;have and the somewhat&nbsp;obscure method by which you keep the report datasources synchronized with the viewer BindingSource components when the source business object changes.&nbsp; It is indeed just a few rather simple steps once you understand them, but they're not things you ever worry about in forms or Xtra Report design.&nbsp; I would rather bet that if MS were actually designing a report writer from scratch and not leveraging the rdl technology this wouldn't be the case, since it isn't in other products.&nbsp; (I won't digress into the discussion of SQL RS as just a big hook to lock you into SQL Server.)</P>

<P>I actually like it quite a bit mainly because it is somewhat of a standard language and being XML based you can do just about anything by generating your own RDL in code and doing a&nbsp;LoadReportDefinition() on it. Although you really can't go completely unbound as it complains if there is no data source at all so I just dummy databind my business object without actually binding any report elements to it.</P>
<P>I know&nbsp;what you mean about the datasources being somewhat over complicated, although if you look at the RDL specs&nbsp;you can tell they where shooting for abstracting the datasources away from any underlying technology, yet at the same time they stick to a relational table/column/row&nbsp;&nbsp;for the actual RDL datasource.</P>
<P>As far as the view mode issues, I get some border clipping based on the controls window resolution as it doesnt seem to do any kind of multisample/AA on the content like say a acrobat viewer does on PDF's.</P>
<P>One thing you can do is <FONT color=#000000>ReportViewer1.SetDisplayMode(Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms.DisplayMode.PrintLayout); and I believe you can remove the print layout button from the toolbar as well if you don't want them switching to interactive mode.</FONT></P>
<P>Overall I think RDL has a lot of potential mainly since MS is trying to standarize it and you can already see thrid parties trying to implement it. See <A href="http://www.fyireporting.com/">http://www.fyireporting.com/</A>&nbsp;for a GPL implemention viewer and renderer and even a GUI end user desginer.</P>
