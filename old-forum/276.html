<P>I have to disagree with your statement that a 'utilities' class is a throwback to procedural programming. IMHO, the whole idea behind object oriented programming and other best practices is to avoid code duplication and hence avoid maintenance problems. If having a 'utility' class helps you avoid code duplication and hence lets you maintain code easily, then that is the route you should take.</P>
<P>The 'utility' class can have one function for each of the ways you want to show the name and it can be called by any class.&nbsp;Is there any&nbsp;better way to avoid code duplication than having a 'utility' class like this? This 'utility' class is a perfect example of avoiding code duplication and creating code that can be easily managed.</P>

<P>Thank you for your comments. I think you are right about code getting duplicated in OOP systems because we are modelling behaviour. And you are also right about having a definite purpose for the utility class instead of dumping miscellaneous functions into it. I stand corrected. </P>
<P>I had meant a general utilities class but I see what you mean. It is always better to have a group of related functions in a class which can be named in such a manner so as to reflect the commonality among the functions.</P>
<P>This is what makes this forum so useful. Healthy debates and discussions lead us to design better software. </P>
<P>Thanks once again,</P>
