One is Members.Library which has some Business Objects and the other is the UI in WPF.<br /><br />In the UI project I am trying to define a window to edit a lookup table (MembershipTypes), but I was getting this error:<br /><br />Assembly 'Members.Library' was not found. Verify that you are not missing an assembly reference. Also, verify that your project and all referenced assemblies have been built.<br /><br />This is on this line in my WPF:<br /><br /><pre>    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"<br />    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"<br />    xmlns:local="clr-namespace:MembersWpf"<br />    xmlns:csla="clr-namespace:Csla.Wpf;assembly=Csla"<br />    xmlns:members="clr-namespace:Members.Library;assembly=Members.Library"></pre><br /><br /><br />I have ensured Members.Library has been built successfully (it also referenced elsewhere successfully) and have ensured it is listed in this projects References (I have even removed it and added it again).<br /><br />I removed the line and typed it in again, Members.Library is not available in the intellisense, but the error has now gone and I have another one which I believe is related:<br /><br />The next line of code is:<br /><br />(I've used pre tags here, but some of the code is not displaying!)<br /><br /><pre><br />    <br />        <br />        <br />                                   ObjectType="{x:Type members:MembershipTypes}"<br />                           FactoryMethod="GetMembershipTypes"<br />                           IsAsynchronous="False"<br />                           DataChanged="DataChanged"<br />                           ManageObjectLifetime="True"><br />        <br /></pre><br /><br /><br />And I am getting this error: <br /><br />The type reference cannot find a public type named 'MembershipTypes'.<br /><br />MembershipTypes is defined in Members.Library. Any ideas what I am doing wrong?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, December 22, 2009</h2>Is there a type <STRONG>Members.Library</STRONG>.MembershipTypes?&nbsp; As in, is that your actual namespace?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Wednesday, December 23, 2009</h2>Yes, I have MembershipTypes.cs which has this code in it:<br /><br />namespace Members.Library<br />{<br />    public class MembershipTypes : BusinessListBase</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Thursday, December 24, 2009</h2>By adding in the Security stuff into Members.Library and adding another form in my MembersWpf project the error has magically disappeared!  I'm not quite sure what has happened, but if/when I understand it I'll post back here.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, December 29, 2009</h2>What Security "stuff" are you refering to?&nbsp; Perhaps your Members.Library wasn't compiling, and so the Wpf project was using an old version of your assembly?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Monday, January 04, 2010</h2>Sorry for the delay.  Was avoiding the computer for a while :)<br /><br />I added in the Identity and Principal code into Members.Library.  If it wasn't compiling it wasn't giving any errors either, but your theory is as good as any.<br /><br />I'm going to get back into it and hopefully things will go smoother from here on.<br /><br />Thanks for your help again<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
