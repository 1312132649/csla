How can I prevent the UI from use&nbsp;Public Sub Add(item of T) that BusinessListBase inherits from Collection(of T)?</P>
<P>Why I need this?</P>
<P>I have a form with two lists, one&nbsp;with Roles granted to a user, and another one with the Roles not granted to a user. Between the list&nbsp;are two buttons "&lt; Add Role" and "Remove Role&gt;". When you clic the buttons, the selected roles in the list&nbsp;go from one list to the other.</P>
<P>In the library that is represented by a parent object with two collection of child objects. When the parent object is created, the collection of not granted roles is filled in the Dataportal_Create. The parent object has two methods: AddRole and RemoveRole.&nbsp;From that&nbsp;methods, (when I have to pass a Role from one list to the other) I want to&nbsp;call a Friend method Add in the collection, with the data of the role been moved. I have something like this working with CSLA 1.1</P>
<P>Well, thatÂ´s all. I hope somebody can read this.</P>
<P>Sorry for my english :-)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Troncho replied on Saturday, December 01, 2012</h2><p>On your&nbsp;constructed class (from BusinessListBase), override InsertItem(..) and RemoveItem(..).</p>
