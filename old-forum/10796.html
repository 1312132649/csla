<p>I was extremely skeptical / the only conceivable route for this, with my understanding, is through features made available through CSLA 4.2 and potentially Xamarin.</p>
<p>Regardless, he went on to state that he had logged into our app and actually did some work before he lost connection and couldn&#39;t reconnect.&nbsp; He says he sent an e-mail to ask about the disconnection as he couldn&#39;t log in again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alwaysontechnologies.com/support/">http://www.alwaysontechnologies.com/support/</a>&nbsp;is the site that serves up this application.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a novel idea (at least to me) and involves a remote hosted firefox browser session that is literally streamed to your mobile device.&nbsp; It&#39;s a concept that totally gets around Silverlight being able to work in a mobile OS.</p>
<p>I asked him &quot;performance must have been slow&quot;, and apparently he said performance was fine.</p>
<p>They only support Silverlight 2 at present though I don&#39;t understand what the barrier would be to using Silverlight 4 or 5 for that matter given the approach taken... you know what, I can&#39;t see how that would be correct (only supporting version 2) since we have a minimum version of 4 on our Silverlight plug in...</p>
<p>Regardless, it is anything but vetted as a solution for us, but given that many of us are using Silverlight with our CSLA apps I was wondering if anyone else had tinkered with this application as a means to distribute your app to mobile.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, October 22, 2011</h2><p>This sounds like what Amazon is doing with their Silk browser for the Fire. And there was a service that did this for WinMo 6.5 too, but I don&#39;t remember the name of it at the moment.</p>
<p>Of course another option is to use the new support for MonoTouch in version 4.2, which allows you to build a native iOS app using your CSLA classes.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Saturday, October 22, 2011</h2><p>Absolutely - upgrading to 4.1 was a precursor for making 4.2 an easier step.&nbsp; I look forward to helping vet 4.2.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
