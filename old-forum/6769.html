<P>I've looked at a number of examples and prototyped some ideas but so far nothing seems very graceful.&nbsp; And, rather than lead the witness by listing everything I've thought of or tried, I was hoping to solicit suggestions.</P>
<P>Essentially what I need to do is create a link to an application somewhere that the host can read it and use it.&nbsp; Any thoughts?!?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, April 08, 2009</h2>Microsoft just built something for this.<br />It is called MEF.<br /><br />Managed Extensibility Framework <br /><br />http://www.codeplex.com/MEF<br /><br />Joe<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
