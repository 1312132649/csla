<P>Hopefully you've read Rocky's book.&nbsp; If not, I recommend doing so as he explains the logic behind his design decisions pretty well.</P>
<P>In this case, the PtMembershipProvider is used instead of the built-in SqlMembershipProvider.&nbsp; The PtMembershipProvider provides the connection to the PtPrincipal and PtIdentity classes.</P>
<P>Remember that the built-in SqlMembershipProvider is designed to work directly with the ASPNET database schema and does not use business objects whereas CSLA has the business objects, such as BusinessPrincipalBase, handle all interaction with the back-end data store.&nbsp; So, there is a fundamental difference in the way to the two providers work.&nbsp; To fully implement a membership provider that leverages CSLA BO's, you will have to implement all of the methods yourself.&nbsp; This is because you will want your provider to delegate to your business objects when performing each operation and, most likely, you'll be returning your business objects instead of the built-in classes that would be returned by the SqlMembershipProvider.</P>
<P>Make sense?&nbsp; HTH</P>
