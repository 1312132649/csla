<P>I'd like to take a look at the FullCSLA.cd as&nbsp;pdf file that was mention in the CSLA C#08 book on page 39.</P>

<P>In any case, I don't know that the pdf was terribly current - it probably was current up through CSLA 3.0 or something.</P>
<P>I'll see if I can find it and provide a link. You shouldn't get too excited though, as it is created using the class diagram tool in VS - and so it just includes the classes, interfaces&nbsp;and inheritance relationships. That designer tool isn't good at reflecting other relationships (containment, agreggation, etc) between class types.</P>
<P>I'm told that VS 2010 (Team Architect)&nbsp;will have some better designer tooling - it will be interesting to see if it is better at reflecting the types of relationships that exist between these types.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>severn.river replied on Monday, May 25, 2009</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
