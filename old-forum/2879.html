But I find that there is no free&nbsp;official document for the framework. Does it mean if&nbsp;I want to have a document, I must pay $24.95 to have it?</P>
<P>If not, could you give me an address to have it?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>William replied on Tuesday, May 15, 2007</h2><P>CSLA framework is comprehensively documented in Rocky's books.</P>

<P>I recommend the book though; it gives you alot to think about beyond just the Csla framework.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Wednesday, May 16, 2007</h2><P>Make sure that if you purchase something that it is the Expert Business Objects 2005 book and not the e-book. The e-book (which I think was 24.95) is to document changes made after the book was released. </P>
<P>Even if you don't end up programming with CSLA, the book is worth it - no question. It was one of the more informative books I made the choice to pick up. But if you only buy the e-book, you'll probably be disappointed because it won't do you much good if you haven't read the core published book. </P>
