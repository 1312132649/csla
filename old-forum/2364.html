<P>Hope you are all well.&nbsp; I was wondering if anyone here has tried to use the ComponentArt grid with the CslaDataSource?&nbsp; or a normal ObjectDataSource and a Csla based List?<BR><BR>I am having problems trying to Bind the CslaDatasource to the grid as the SelectObject method doesnt seem to run.&nbsp; I am using version 2.1.3 of the Csla framework.<BR><BR>I would really appreicate some sample code if anyone has got the grid and either data source to work correctly.&nbsp; I am also trying to implement the sorting and grouping functionality of the grid, but need to use the CslaDataSource first, and i believe the rest will fall into place.<BR><BR>Thanks in advanced.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
