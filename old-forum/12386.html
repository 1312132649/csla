<p>Do I have to manually call that rule in the OnChildChanged override...or does that happen automatically because I point at the corresponding propertyinfo in the AddRule(myListPropertyInfo as core.PropertyInfo)?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>You must trigger the rule in OnChildChanged.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>swegele replied on Tuesday, February 18, 2014</h2><p>I am using private backing fields for the child collections...they are marked with &lt;NonSerialized(), NotUndoable()&gt; to keep them from being saved in BeginEdits.</p>
<p>In 3.8 those collections had to be marked with WithEvents because I detected changes in the ListChanged event.&nbsp; Now that I am detected changes in OnChildChanged I assume I can get rid of the WithEvents now?</p>
<p>Thanks man!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
