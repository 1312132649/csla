This is easy to do if the&nbsp;object belongs to a&nbsp;read only collection by calling ResetItem (or OnListChanged), but I can't work out how to do it for a single read only object.</P>
<P>Does anyone know how to do this?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 26, 2007</h2><P>If a property changes, the object should raise a PropertyChanged event as defined by INotifyPropertyChanged.</P>
<P>ReadOnlyBase doesn't implement this interface because read-only objects are read-only, and thus not intended to be changed.</P>
<P>If you have a changing read-only object, then you have two options:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Inherit from BusinessBase so you can call OnPropertyChanged() - remember that you can still implement read-only properties in a BusinessBase subclass, so your object can be effectively read-only, but still has the intrastructure support for changing properties<BR></LI>
<LI>Implement INotifyPropertyChanged in your business class (making sure to follow the pattern shown in Chapter 3 for BindableBase to avoid serialization issues, and making sure to use the attributes used for the Saved event (as discussed in the 2.1 Handbook), because your event is being declared below UndoableBase in the inheritance hierarchy)</LI></OL>

<P>Just to clarify why&nbsp;my read-only objects do change, my project has quite a few read-only objects for display or selection purposes. When&nbsp;an editable object is saved I use the channel events (in ActiveObjects) to notify any related objects of the change so they can update themselves internally rather than do a&nbsp;refresh from the database.&nbsp;I find this method works really well and improves perfomance significantly when using&nbsp;a slower network link to the database. So in this sense, read-only means you can't update the object's properties, but it can still change.</P>
<P>Your first suggestion looks like the way to go - quick and simple. Thanks again.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
