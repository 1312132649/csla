<P>I know alot of these warnings are because of the C5 stuff from Niels Kokholm and Peter Sestoft, since almost all warnings are in the Csla.C5 namespace.</P>
<P>Can those warnings&nbsp;be solved?<BR>Even if it's "external code".</P>

<P>If you really can't handle their warnings, you can pull C5 into a separate assembly, change the Csla project to reference it and isolate their warnings into that other project. But that's just moving the issue from place A to B.</P>
<P>Of course C5 is open source. I bet they'd welcome any help you can offer in terms of solving the warnings in their project.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Monday, February 09, 2009</h2>Sorry for the question and your totally right about not touching 3rd party library code, same as i don't change CSLA code. Time shouldn't even be of the essence, it's the fact that it's 3rd party.<br /><br />But it's fun to dive a bit deeper :)<br /><br />http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/<br /><br />and<br /><br />http://github.com/neoeinstein/c5/blob/master/BUILD.txt<br /><br />they even say:<br /><br />"The build should complete with a few dozen compilation warnings."</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Monday, February 09, 2009</h2>Btw, they have a nice wiki<br />http://wiki.github.com/neoeinstein/c5<br /><br />lol :)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
