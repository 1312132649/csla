I have Profile as an ancestor class to individuals and organizations. </P>
<P>Now, all profiles have a collection of names (one of which is the primary). The thing is, Individual Names and Organization Names differ (Individual names&nbsp;have name parts &amp; such), but they both implement IProfileName.</P>
<P>So what is important is that Profile holds a collection of ProfileNames. So my first intuition was to create a collection of type: ProfileNameCollection : BusinessListBase&lt;ProfileNameCollection, IProfileName&gt;. </P>
<P>There are two drawbacks - 1) the collection needs to know what kind of IProfileName it is dealing with when handling new rows. So I am, when the collection is created, having it carry along the "type of IProfileName" it is dealing with in a type member variable.&nbsp;And 2) because the collection is of IProfileName, when I bind it to a grid it's only letting me utilize members of the interface. This is especially a problem with respect to individual names, where I want to have the name parts. </P>
<P>Before I did this refactoring, I had two collections, IndividualNameCollection and OrganizationNameCollection. They each held IndividualName and OrganizationName members, respectively - but they were in the Individual and Organization classes and made dealing with "IProfile" records generically for names&nbsp;somewhat impossible.&nbsp;(Individuals and Organizations had the collections, not the Profile base class).&nbsp; </P>
<P>So I want to get this right and I thought I'd throw it out there to see if someone had a nice idea. </P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
