In its constructors I do NOT invoke MarkAsChild(), correct? I'd only invoke MarkAsChild for the collection if the collection was itself a property of another CSLA object?<br><br>However, in the constructors for the collection's items, I DO invoke MarkAsChild()?<br><br>i.e. the collection itself is not a child, but its items are (they are children of the collection). <br><br>Is there ever a time when the items in a collection would NOT be Mark(ed)AsChild?<br><br>The only reason I ask is I didn't invoke MarkAsChild in my collection's items, and so far everything is working fine (adding/edit). Having said that, I 've just started to look at deleting and n-level undo on the collection, and this has led me to these questions.<br><br>thanks<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, March 22, 2007</h2>The only time you wouldn't call MarkAsChild for items that will be contained in a colletion is if the collection will be a subclass of EditableRootListBase.&nbsp; But you'd only use that if each item in the collection may be saved by itself, outside the scope of the other items and the collection itself.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FreeAsInBeer replied on Thursday, March 22, 2007</h2>Yeah, that makes a bit more sense now. Thanks for confirming it for me. </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
