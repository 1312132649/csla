<P>Many thanks!</P>

However, its only enforced via the IsReadOnly property which has the protected modifier for set therefore you can change it inside your class. ie,&nbsp; do IsReadOnly = false before the insert. I didn't download your files but if you're wanting to do that from outside the class then you're either using the ReadOnly concept wrongly or its not what you want.<br><br>Ross<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>albruan replied on Wednesday, September 06, 2006</h2>Thanks!&nbsp; I figured I must've been overlooking something...sure enough, I neglected to&nbsp;set&nbsp;IsReadOnly equal to false before attempting to add the items.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jkellywilkerson replied on Wednesday, September 06, 2006</h2><P>You may have done this as well, but you want to make sure that you set IsReadOnly back to true right after the insert as well.</P>
