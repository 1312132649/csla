<p>I like the factory methods in SL using the callback. But looking at the samples I do not see these used in WPF but solely in SL. Is there any reason for this?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Sunday, July 25, 2010</h2><p>The async factory stuff was added to support silverlight, which requires such calls to be async.&nbsp; So there&#39;s no choice there.&nbsp; In Wpf there is no such requirement, however I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any reason you couldn&#39;t use the async factory calls in Wpf either, except that the sync methods are easier to code against.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 26, 2010</h2><p>The async data portal and factory concepts are available in WPF. I tend to use them in both SL and WPF, because I prefer the resulting UI feel - but of course it does mean you have to do all the UI stuff in WPF that you need to do in SL to deal with the data access (and very likely some business rules) being async.</p>
<p>All the stuff I discuss in the <i>CSLA 4 MVVM video series</i> is async. And while the sample is in Silverlight, the same code constructs work in WPF.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
