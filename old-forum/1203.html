<P>I have a CSLA object that has a Enum as one of its properties.</P>
<P>I then try to make a "Master-details" editor for this object but I have touble to bind the Enum property properly to a Drop-Down box.</P>
<P>Is it possible? </P>
<P>The first question is how the ComboBox is populated with all the possible Enum types??</P>
<P>Or should I instead create a separate Integer&nbsp;representation property of the enum and then manually map it to a not data-bound ComboBox?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I've come to appreciate that perhaps that I may start shying away from Enums myself and moving more towards NameValueLists (well, my equivalent) with zero to many values represented as constants within the "NVL" class to <EM>function like an enum</EM> w/ intellisense, etc. I get a more consistent approach - binding "code option trees" (my NVL) to comboboxes/dropdowns throughout - without some of the "no/nos" of using enums as properties of BOs and the quirkiness with binding them to comboboxes and dropdownlists. </P>
<P>My two cents... </P>
<P>(There are a lot of things enums make a lot of sense for, don't get me wrong!) </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Wednesday, September 13, 2006</h2>You can do this:<br><br>comboBox1.DataSource = Enum.GetValues(typeof(MyEnum));<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brad replied on Wednesday, September 13, 2006</h2>sune42 wrote:<br>"The first question is how the ComboBox is populated with all the possible Enum types??"<br><br>There have been some excellent suggestions posted in this thread if you require to bind the actual enumeration values to the combo box. On some occasions, I have needed some extra UI customisation of those bound enum values (i.e. I may require to bind the enum value "TurnLeft" - but actually want "Turn Left" displayed to the user). The following blog post I wrote gives some detail about how I went about this:<br><a href="http://www.dotnetgeeks.com/blogs/bleach/archive/2006/07/22/Enumeration-Binding.aspx">http://www.dotnetgeeks.com/blogs/bleach/archive/2006/07/22/Enumeration-Binding.aspx</a><br><br>Hope this helps. <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br>-Brad<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
