<P>I've watched the Office demos and the thing is very impressive.&nbsp; So much so that I began to play around with how I could use it for my application.&nbsp; But the one thing that I couldn't figure out is how to organize my menu into the ribbon paradigm.</P>
<P>Then I came across the statement in the DevExpress newsgroups by one of their team that the ribbon control is not meant for MDI applications.&nbsp; Suddenly, the reason for my struggles all made sense.</P>
<P>In Word, 90% of what would be on the ribbon control is functionality for manipulating the document currently displayed.&nbsp; In a typical MDI enterprise application, 90% of the menu and toolbar control is simply for navigating the application.&nbsp; The functional buttons for a particular crud form are really limited to the basic crud operations - add/delete/save/undo.&nbsp; So the paradigm of grouping the functionality relative to an edit form&nbsp;into groups in the ribbon control just breaks down.</P>
<P>Ok, so the ribbon control is out.&nbsp; But that got me really thinking about menus and toolbars in general.&nbsp; I've never been a big fan of merged menus and toolbars in an MDI application... I just can't see how that is as intuitive to the user as my current approach which is:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The main menu/toolbar is primarily for navigation around the application as a whole</LI>
<LI>Each form has its own toolbar for the operations specific to that form (basically just the crud operations)</LI></OL>
<P>This seems like the most obvious and intuitive thing to me for the user... I person with no training whatsoever would understand the first time they opened a form that the "Save" button on that form is what you use to save the Customer you just edited.</P>
<P>I welcome your thoughts.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Monday, November 27, 2006</h2><P>Hi, Dan.</P>
<P>Looks like 45 people have viewed this and no comments yet.</P>
<P>My take is that everyone agrees.&nbsp; It' heartening to feel that there is so much agreement in this community on the topic.&nbsp; But if your intent was to reallyl generate the discussion... well, a little disappointing, eh?</P>
<P>My own view?&nbsp; I agree, too.&nbsp; KISS.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, November 28, 2006</h2>Q,<br><br>I think others are interested, however I think they are in the same boat as I.&nbsp; Basically, I haven't had time to check out the ribbon control for myself, so beyond what the OP has said about the ribbon, I really don't know anything about it.&nbsp; <br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DanielVW replied on Tuesday, November 28, 2006</h2><P>my two cents ....</P>
<P>At my previous company I worked with a lot of web designers and Information Architects.&nbsp; Obviously most of their input regarding menus and actions are based on web sites, but I really like the reasons and easiness of it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>a web site has global navigation which takes you around the different sections (home, about, projects, client login, etc ...)&nbsp; each section then has its own set of actions/navigation.&nbsp; it is important to visually differentiate these types of navigation, by colour, positioning on the forms, buttons, fonts, you name it.&nbsp; actionable items (like uploading a file) has the button next to the place of relevance, and not on a menu.&nbsp; </P>
<P>They also stressed that a user should not be inundated with options.&nbsp; usually the max is around 7.&nbsp; more than that can become "information overload" and the user can forget why they are on a page, and what they have to do.</P>
<P>this has carried over into my win apps very much the way you suggest in the original post.&nbsp; the menu is basically just for navigation and each form has its own buttons specific to that form.&nbsp; we follow something similar to the XP style of explorer, where there's the "grouped" buttons on the left hand side with a caption for the group ("file tasks", etc ...).&nbsp; </P>
<P>most applications i'm involved&nbsp;with are workflow based and hence the user must know why they are on a form, have the info/tools on the form to do what they need to do and then leave when they are done.&nbsp; </P>
<P>i haven't been involved in writing a "workspace" type application where you basically work on one thing that's not MDI, like Word and&nbsp;Photoshop.</P>
<P>I've seen "the ribbon" and used it during training.&nbsp; For the purposes of Word, Excel, etc, it's totally amazing and very productive.&nbsp; especially the preview of some of the buttons.</P>
<P>It's always interesting to see how MS evolves their menus and user experience, and how that trickles down to the apps we build.&nbsp; also to see how it trickles down in their own applications.&nbsp; i wonder if "the ribbon" will work well with VS2005?</P>
