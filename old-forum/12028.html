The objects are displayed on an Outlook style calendar. When an item is changed the first time, the OnChildChanged is called and processes as expected. The business object changes are saved and all is good. The next change, however, OnChildChanged isn&#39;t called and the changes are again saved to disk. Every time the business object is changed after the initial one OnChildChanged is not called.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I change a different business object (for the first time) the OnChildChanged is called.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I then go back and change the one that was previously changed, the OnChildChanged is still not called.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes;">&nbsp; </span>It seems to get called one time for each business object and that is it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes;">&nbsp; </span>I believe that I am running on CSLA 4.3&rsquo;s latest build.</span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, June 17, 2013</h2><p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever an object is changed you will get a new instance back. It seems like your eventhandler is still attached to the original object - not the new object that was returned from Save. How do you attach to the items event?&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>thaehn replied on Tuesday, June 18, 2013</h2><p>Jonny,</p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">I am not doing anything when they modify the object through the control. When the calendar control changes the business object, it is saved automatically. I am depending on the framework to wire up everything. If they double-click and bring up a dialog box, then I am saving the object. After it is saved, I update the current object with the changes returned from the save though a helper method on the current&nbsp;object (there are only a couple things they can change like start and end dates.&nbsp; It is getting updated correctly becuase I can see the changes on the calendar.&nbsp; In both case, only the first time a change is made is the OnChildChanged called.</span></p>

<p>Can you provide us a small sample to showcase the issue?&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Saturday, June 29, 2013</h2><p>Hi Todd,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you are correct that the event hooks is not set correctly on a saved item.&nbsp;</p>
