<p>I am wondering is there a way to implement Error Message when there are more than two decimal places?</p>
<p>e.g., 50.678 throw error message or 50.6.7.8 throw error message</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is a way to acheieve this functionality in CSLA.</p>
<p>For now i am using regular expressions, but i would like to implement this in CSLA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
<p>&nbsp;private static bool IntegerValidation&lt;T&gt;(T target, RuleArgs e) where T : ClassName</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (target.ReadProperty(txtbox1proprty) != null &amp;&amp;.........</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e.Description = &quot;Do not allow decimals&quot;;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return false;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
