<P>There are numerous CSLA-related projects out there, some currently housed on gotdotnet (which probably has a limited future now that CodePlex is here), and others on people's servers, etc.</P>
<P>I wonder if it would make sense to create a single home for public CSLA-related projects like this? Perhaps a CSLA-contrib (like nant-contrib), or CSLA-eX (CSLA extensions) or ...? This could be hosted on CodePlex, and so would have bug tracking, forum and source control support hosted by Microsoft.</P>
<P>In no way am I pressuring people to give up control over projects or anything remotely like that. But I do want to have a conversation to see if this makes sense (or not), and if it does make sense how to proceed. I have the ear of the CodePlex team, and so am certain we can get a project set up there (it is moderated) if that is a desirable direction to go.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rasupit replied on Thursday, June 29, 2006</h2><P>I hope CodePlex won't turn out to be as bad as GotDotNet.&nbsp; GotDotNet is a joke, I experience numerous problem with this site.&nbsp; The worst one when I was being identified as different user and locked out from accessing my own workspace for a few days.</P>

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=931495413-30062006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>CodePlex is different from gotdotnet (thankfully!), and 
Microsoft built it from day 1 for this kind of thing. Gotdotnet was an 
experiemental project that went live and rapidly outgrew its own capabilities. 
One story goes that it was originally hosted (live) on a developer's machine 
under his desk. This changed one weekend when his machine went down and 
gotdotnet disappeared. After that they moved it to an IT hosted area - but 
still, it wasn't developed in a formal way... CodePlex was built as a formal 
project - the only experiemental bits are that it uses TFS behind the scenes, 
which is a version 1 technology - so it will be interesting to see if TFS can 
scale :)</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<P>I very much hope this doesn't lead to a big dogmatic discussion on the various merits of the various OSS licenses out there - that would be a huge waste of time. I think we need to identify a license that has the least possible constraints on the contributors and consumers of the CSLAcontrib project. </P>
<P>This is particularly true because some contributions might include code bits that are directly included in someone's business solution - and something like the GPL makes that difficult at times.</P>
<P>As far as I know, once we get the license sorted out we are ready to go!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 07, 2006</h2><P>Here is some more information from the CodePlex team on both the multi-project and license questions:</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#000080 size=2>I should mention a few things that might help you and your CSLA team members come to some decisions:<BR><BR>1) You can create multiple projects on CodePlex that is not a problem, so please don’t feel any contstaints in that respect. There is ample opportunity to link different CSLA projects via the Wiki in each project, and this can be leveraged in powerful ways. Using RSS-linking between projects could also be very helpful. Also, we’ll be adding a feature in the near term where there will be the concept of linked groups that can be accessed from a single launch point ( I guess the rough equivalent is “Featured Groups” on GotDotNet’s CodeGallery). <BR><BR>2) The Creative Commons license wizard has been really helpful to people even if they don’t plan on using a Creative Commons license. It takes you through the logical considerations that need to be made about long-term distribution of your code base and presents scenarios that get you thinking about what you might want to do with it. <BR>You may already be familiar with it, but just in case, here is the site:&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT><A title=http://creativecommons.org/license/ href="http://creativecommons.org/license/"><FONT face=Arial size=2>http://creativecommons.org/license/</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial color=#000080 size=2> <BR><BR>Looking forward to having your project up on the site, there is a lot of excitement on the CodePlex team around this one. </FONT><BR></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 11, 2006</h2><P>I am gathering (by the resounding silence) that licensing is not an interesting topic <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /></P>
<P>So I propose this: <A href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/</A></P>
<P>The license basically grants people the right to do whatever they want with the stuff in CSLAcontrib, as long as the original author is attributed. It also provides as much legal "provided as-is" protection as we're likely to find with any license. It also means that the contributor retains ownership, but grants wide rights of use to the world.</P>
<P>Barring any nay votes within the next couple days, I propose we use this license and just roll forward?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rasupit replied on Tuesday, July 11, 2006</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>I have actually been granting this right so I'm ok with granting user to do whatever they please&nbsp;with&nbsp;it.&nbsp; </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, July 16, 2006</h2><P>The CodePlex site is now set up.
