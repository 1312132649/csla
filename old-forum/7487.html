If i comment out the attribute, things run fine in test., but the network here is so darn flakey, I need to use them.<br /><br />I read that Rocky has posted a recommended methodology for including manual transactions in CSLA. Can someone point out that post to me, please? I've been looking for an hour now and haven't found it.<br /><br />(I have the BO books up to the 3 handbook.)<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br />_E</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>IanK replied on Thursday, September 17, 2009</h2><P>Doing a search for MSDTC on the forum should through up a few posts which may help you.</P>
