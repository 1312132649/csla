Since the object has already been populated from the database, I would<br />like to avoid going back to the server.Suppose the childwindow only edits values on a particular child that belongs to a listbase that is a child of the root, I&#39;d like to be able ot send this child <br />business object over to the childwindow&#39;s viewmodel. My questions are as follows</p>
<p>1) Is this the right approach? If not, what is?<br />2) What is the best way to implement this ? RIght now i have a constructor in the childwindow&#39;s viewmodel that accepts an object of this child type and sets it directly to the Model property </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;public childwindowEditViewModel (BusinessObjectType businessobject)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.ManageObjectLifetime = false;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;this.Model = businessobject;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
<p>However if I do it this way, I am wondering how I can refresh the parent page with the child object is altered.</p>
<p>Please comment..</p>
