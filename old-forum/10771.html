<p>After I left, I realized I didn&#39;t quite understand <em>how</em> this translates into better performance and wanted to ask (I realize this isn&#39;t strictly related to CSLA):&nbsp; </p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Since CSLA objects are mobile, and those objects&nbsp;are serialized and sent over the wire to an app server so that they can be re-created and then interact with the database, is the benefit in 3-tier on a WAN due to those objects being smaller in size than the amount of data that would be sent to the DB server directly when running in 2-tier mode?&nbsp; Or is there something else that accounts for the benefit in running a 3-tier deployment when users are on the WAN?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, October 13, 2011</h2><p>In a 2 tier the client talks directly to the database. </p>
<p>Imagine saving 100 rows of data on a WAN in a 2 tier vs 3 tier model:</p>
<p>2-tier: make 100 sql calls to the database using a database connection and handles transaction(s) over a potentially slow line or </p>
<p>3: tier: make 1 call (Save) to the server and the server makes 100 sql calls and handles transaction(s) on the LAN to the database.</p>
<p>Plus Sql connections use custom ports that are typically not open/available to the outside world whereas http/https typically is. </p>
<p>You would not even need to have the database client software installed on the clients.</p>
<p><b>So from a communications perspective (ports and protocols), to avoid &quot;chatty&quot; direct sql connection and simpler software distribution are all advantages in a 3-tier scenario. </b></p>
