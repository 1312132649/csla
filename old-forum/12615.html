Although everything we do is run locally, we have typically not marked everything with RunLocal. However, one of my classes is generating OutOfMemory exceptions and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the result of serialization of slightly larger object graphs, 200-300 objects, no blobs. (And yes, I&#39;ve confirmed that I don&#39;t have any recursive references.)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, May 08, 2014</h2><p>RunLocal does not affect how the objects is serialized. Only how the call is directed to the LocalPortal.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bgilbert replied on Thursday, May 08, 2014</h2><p>Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
