<P>...and then the user clicks the ugly, evil BACK button on his browser.</P>
<P>These means the user now sees the collection as empty or as having one less item than what it really has - the screen doesn't match the actual collection as it exists in memory.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Do you guys handle this in any particular way?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Monday, January 29, 2007</h2>A common trick is to use client-side javascript to purge the history so that the back button is negated or set the most recent entry to the current page.&nbsp; Do a search on the web and you'll find many examples.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Monday, January 29, 2007</h2><P>Cool, thanks.</P>
<P>Does that script still work if javascript is turned off in the browser (security level, I mean)?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
