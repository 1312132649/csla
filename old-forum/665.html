I figure the site is being backuped or something. <br><br>Maybe you know, and do not want to do something about it. But I figured, I just let you know. <br><br>Not that it matters much, because most users of the forum are in your timezone, so the most action takes place at other times of the day. <br><br>This forum is really cool though.
