<P>The new book (cited properly in other messages on this thread) is the one for VS 2005 development with .NET Framework 2.0.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Note how consistent Rocky has been with his own framework version numbering to keep the major number the same as .NET's framework version.&nbsp; Thanks for making it easy on us Rocky.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If only Microsoft was as kind &lt;g&gt;.&nbsp; I can remember how&nbsp;confusing it was to keep track of the version numbers of VB, Access, JET, Office, and Visual Studio&nbsp;when they were making their version changes at nearly the same time back in the 16-bit and early 32-bit days.&nbsp; Now even Visual Studio and SQL Server share the same version number.&nbsp; Of course, that won't last long &lt;sigh&gt;.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
