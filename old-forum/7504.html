<DIV><BR>Is this possible?</DIV>
<DIV>If so, are there any performance hits to this.</DIV>
<DIV>Also any URLs out there explaining how to do this?<BR><BR>Thanks</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, August 24, 2009</h2>Yes, using local reports.  I haven't tried Csla + server report.<br /><br />As for urls, check out gotreportviewer.com; you give it Csla objects just as you would POCO objects.<br /><br />I haven't measured performance, becuase this is the only way I do reports... but it seems to be fast.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, August 24, 2009</h2>Hi, <br><br>It is possible to bind to objects serverside too, but very cumbersome and poorly documented so  I don't recommend doing that. <br><br><a href="http://www.gotreportviewer.com">www.gotreportviewer.com</a> is an excellent starting point. <br><br>And a walkthrough example on MSDN: <br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms251784%28VS.80%29.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms251784%28VS.80%29.aspx </a><br><br>You may also download the latest trunk from "Csla 3.6.3 for .Net 2.0" samples - I have added 2 reports to the PTWin solution using ReportViewer and objects as datasource. One simple list report and one report with subreport. (Solution requires Visual Studio 2008 but compiles for .Net 2.0 SP1 runtime)<br><br>/jonnybee<br><br><br><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SouthSpawn replied on Wednesday, August 26, 2009</h2>I am doing an ASP.net application.<BR>So is this still possible?<BR></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, August 26, 2009</h2>Yes, <br><br>ReportViewer comes in both Windows Form s and ASP.NET. You'll find several examples on <a href="http://www.gotreportviewer.com">www.gotreportviewer.com</a> .<br><br>So, yes - you can use ReportViewer in ASP.NET with object data sources. <br><br>/jonnybee<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
