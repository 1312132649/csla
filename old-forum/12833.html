<p>Does MVVM mean you can completely avoid changing code when the XAML changes? No. But it is a whole lot closer than any other technique I&rsquo;ve seen in my 24+ year career.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Caliburn Micro appears to be the best MVVM framework out there &ndash; certainly the most widely used.</p>

<p>I guess both statements are still true:</p>
<ul>
<li>doing MVVM is a must</li>
<li>Caliburn.Micro is the best MVVM framework around</li>
</ul>
<p>It happens some people still develop in Windows Forms. It also happens Visual WebGUI is a Windows Forms look alike, that instead of making desktop applications, makes web applications.</p>
<p>The point is about MVVM and the lack of decent port of a MVVM framework - any framework - to these programming environments. There are a number of partial solutions but nowhere near the real thing.</p>
<p>Interesting enough, people spent more time arguing why MVVM can&#39;t be done on Windows Forms and why Caliburn.Micro can&#39;t be ported to Windows.Forms than actually trying to do it.</p>
<p>It turns out that since Mar 14, 2012, there was an almost complete port of Caliburn.Micro to Windows Forms hidden among the +100 forks of Caliburn.Micro. Dan Durland is the author of <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/ddurland/CaliburnMicroWinForms">this port</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mvvmfx.codeplex.com/">MVVM FX Project</a> took it as a starting point. Some major Caliburn.Micro features were missing but now they are working as they should. We can say the port is in beta stage.</p>
<p>Before a formal release announcement is made, a few more samples must be made. A Csla Adapter (ViewModelBase) is planned as well as a Csla sample.</p>
<p>Since there are enough samples to understand how to use the most basic features, you are invited to start using it right now.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
