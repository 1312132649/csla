<br>
Don't want anyone to go to any real bother on this inquiry, it will
probably turn out to be something simple stupid I'm doing with further
investigation, but just in case anyone else has ever had a similar
problem and might know the solution.<br>
<br>
I have a Person BO that has a child collection of Phone Numbers, prior
to moving to 2.0, I was able to see all rows in my grid, but with
CSLA/NET 2.0, I'm only seeing one row on using the new CSLA binding
sources in the manner they appear to be used in the book for a
master/detail relationship (i.e. ProjectEdit form).<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
