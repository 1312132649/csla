I’m try to install CSLA but when I like to generate solution I have a few
errors.<br>
First question:<br>
Is there any check list that I need to install before use this solution?<br>
Second: <br>
Is there any way to install the framework only for windows applications in
order to study these features?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance<br>

Please if not the Wright folder pleases tell me where I must post it</span></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, July 02, 2009</h2>When asking your question, it's helpful to have the detail of your errors. I would wager that searching with the keywords of your error will likely turnout results with a solution to your problem.<br /><br />For Silverlight there have been instruction guides posted for installation, but I'm not entirely sure if you're using that or not. <br /><br />What is the problem that you are encountering? </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
