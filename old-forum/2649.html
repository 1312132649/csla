<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Lakusha replied on Tuesday, April 03, 2007</h2><P>The number of concurrent connections have nothing to do with SQL Server licensing. SQL Server licenses can be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Free (SQL Express)<BR></LI>
<LI>Per CAL (irrelevant with the number of connections)<BR></LI>
<LI>Per Server/Socket</LI></UL>
<P>In your case, since the number of clients is known in advance (not like Internet), you can choose whatever you want. I prefer a per cpu (simpler) but if you have a mlimited number of users and N cpu, using CALs can be cost effective. Contact MS for details.</P>
<P>hope it helps.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
