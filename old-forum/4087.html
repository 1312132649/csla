<P>I have got this book <A><SPAN class=b24-booktitle>Expert One-on-One Visual Basic .NET Business Objects</SPAN></A>. Though it would have been more rightful to use 2005 version however, I have found earliear book more understandable as per my my exposure. I though it would better&nbsp;migrate to 2005 version after understanding framework throughly.</P>
<P>However, I have not been able to locate the control&nbsp;DataListView used in&nbsp;project PTracker. If any one has got that, it would be real help to me for implementing the framework. Pl mail me&nbsp;on <A href="mailto:vcsmails@gmail.com">vcsmails@gmail.com</A>.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P>
