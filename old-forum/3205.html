<P>It appears, but I'm not completely sure, that Microsoft messed up here, and that you can set copy local to false on PresentationCore. It also appears that getting rid of System.Printing.dll requires that you explicitly reference System.Printing.dll and set copy local to false.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Microsoft maybe <EM>does</EM> have a good reason for having copy local set to true - and it is under that assumption that I left the value as the default...</P>
<P>In my limited testing it does appear that preventing the local copy causes no issue though.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
