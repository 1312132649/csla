When it's submitted via a HTTPS link it's encrypted but what about once I populate my CSLA objects with it on the server will it be secured or do I need to apply some encryption to the fields that contain the sensitive data to be passed to the db?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, November 30, 2006</h2>Usually it depends on the data.&nbsp; If you're storing a password, its probably better to keep it encrypted (hashed actually) in the database.&nbsp; Credit card numbers should probably be encrypted before being sent to the db (because you'll have to unencrypt it later possibly).<br><br>Also, how is the web server connected to the db server?&nbsp; If its over a trusted connection, encryption may be overkill.&nbsp; But if the web server connection to the database server could be publicly visible, you may want to use an encrypted connection to sql server.&nbsp; I've personally never set that up, but you should be able to google to find answers on how that is done.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
