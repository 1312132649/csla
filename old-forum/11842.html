<p><br />I have a Csla app (.NET 4.5 server with SL5 client with a bunch of cool async/await stuff) and I want to do a simplistic front end Android app. I was going to use Xamarin, but I hit a speed bump and can&#39;t afford it and my VS Pro trial ran out. I won&#39;t be able to use Xamarin for another month or two. In the meantime, is there a way for me to somehow utilize Asp for a mobile front end? If so, are there any examples? I&#39;ve already read many of the e-books several times over, but I never got the Asp because I never had the need... and now if the answer to these two questions are &#39;Yes&#39;, I&#39;ll definitely be getting the book - but I just don&#39;t know enough about Asp and how that programming model works with Csla to know how to proceed. </p>
<p><br />I have read some other posts and things about html5 and jquery and whatnot, but I still am at a loss as to how to proceed. I wish I could use the Xamarin + VS 2012 Pro but I just can&#39;t! Argh! So, since I&#39;ve taught myself most of what I know architecturally in a large part by studying Csla, I was hoping I could learn a little more from you guys if you&#39;d help me out - and I figure other people might want to use Csla + Asp/Html5 for a mobile solution if that&#39;s possible, and this could help them out as well. But I know I would definitely appreciate any help anyone can give me on this. <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, February 16, 2013</h2><p>In .NET 4.5 Microsoft did quite a bit of work in Web Forms and MVC to better support web pages on mobile devices. iirc they even embraced jqueryMobile (?)</p>
<p>In any case, on the server side there&#39;s no real difference between a mobile or not mobile web site. The differences are in the user experience design and the web page layouts.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bill.mybiz replied on Saturday, February 16, 2013</h2><p>Thanks for your response, Rocky.</p>
<p>So, since there is no real difference on the server side and the differences lay in the user experience design and web page layouts, then I figure the Csla ASP e-book will help and I&#39;m going to go ahead and buy it. Then, with that stuff as a starting point, I&#39;ll try to fix it up with any enhancements in the newer versions of ASP - including some of the jquery, which I understand to be somewhat of an optimization from all postbacks to partial refreshes. But for me, this isn&#39;t a big deal at the moment, because I just want to have some simple behavior for reviewing translations.</p>
<p><br />So thanks again for your time Sir!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Monday, February 18, 2013</h2><p>Bill - to confirm what Rocky said, the &quot;Mobile Application&quot; template in VS 2010/12 does include the jQueryMobile library. You&#39;ll probably need to update it via NuGet, though, to make sure you have the latest version. About 6 months ago I used this template to create an app for my company&#39;s sales force, and the experience was pretty good. I didn&#39;t have many ajax calls nor did I follow some of the examples that are listed on the JQM website for partial postbacks. I kept it pretty simple. </p>
<p>The big thing that JQM provided for me was the iPhone appearance for all the controls. For the most part, the app looked like a mobile app (with the comfort of dealing with ASP.NET and CSLA behind the scenes). And the effort was minimal. The <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/">JQM docs</a> should get you up to speed very quickly.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bill.mybiz replied on Monday, February 18, 2013</h2><p>Tim, thanks for the tips. I did go ahead and update JQM, and I&#39;m going to also shoot for that UI look. Much appreciated Sir. Now, I just gotta keep crankin&#39;. ;)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
