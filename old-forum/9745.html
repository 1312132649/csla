<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a form with some silverlight data bound controls along with the csla propertystatus controls. Now the business object it is bound to, have some business rules in it. If I am explicitly making changes to the data in the control which in turn triggers any validation error i am getting a nice red error message, all this is getting handled by csla and working&nbsp;excellent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Again say the user has entered some value and hits the done button in the form i am running the rules by using the code </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this.BusinessRules.CheckRules();&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;for the business object. I am also getting individual errors from brokenrulescollection. Which at present I am displaying in a messagebox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want is a way to set the controls in errorstate where ever the rule is broken instead of displaying the messagebox. Is there any easy way to do that?</p>
<p>Hope I was been able to describe my problem</p>
<p>Regards</p>
