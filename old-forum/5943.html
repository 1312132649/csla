<P>I'm working to have a final release of 3.6 as quickly as possible. The RC1 release includes a small number of bug fixes based on issues reported through the <A href="/"><FONT color=#669966>CSLA .NET forum</FONT></A>. Barring any show-stopping bug reports over the next few days, I expect to release version 3.6 on December 15.</P>
<P>If you intend to use version 3.6, please download this release candidate and let me know if you encounter any issues. Thank you!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 05, 2008</h2>Hi,<br><br>I'm checking the code for CslaDataProvider, so that I can work my changes back in.&nbsp; <br><br>It looks like the Save is now always cloning, if the instance supports IClonable.&nbsp; Shouldn't it be checking ApplicationContext.AutoCloneOnUpdate?<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, December 05, 2008</h2><P>That was an intentional change - though I do have concerns.</P>
<P>The AutoCloneOnUpdate functionality in the data portal is good - required actually to provide consistency with a remote data portal.</P>
<P>But it has a limitation, in that the clone occurs after ApplyEdit() is called. So an error on the server will result in the client-side object graph being "valid", but not in its original state. </P>
<P>In other words, the user couldn't click Cancel to undo the (presumably) bad edits they did, because the changes were committed into the object graph.</P>
<P>So the change to CslaDataProvider does a clone <EM>before</EM> ApplyEdit(), and if there's a server error the UI gets back the <EM>original</EM> object graph, so the user can click Cancel and have a consistent result.</P>
<P>I'm totally open to other solutions here - though I don't want to lose the new Cancel support.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 05, 2008</h2>Actually that makes total sense to me.&nbsp; I (wrongly) was thinking the CslaDataProvider was doing the cloning to be consistent with remoting... but that's not the case, so bad question on my part.&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 05, 2008</h2>Hi,<br><br>I found a warning that Csla.EditableRootListBase&lt;T&gt;.Child_PropertyChanged(object, System.ComponentModel.PropertyChangedEventArgs) hides inherited member Csla.Core.ExtendedBindingList&lt;T&gt;.Child_PropertyChanged(object, System.ComponentModel.PropertyChangedEventArgs).<br><br>Should ERLB be changed to protected override?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, December 05, 2008</h2>Thanks - fixed.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
