I had to disable .net framework source debugging.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ash002 replied on Wednesday, March 04, 2009</h2><font face="Tahoma">hi, thanks for the reply. I have the options to ommit .net debugging disabled as far as I am aware - "Enable Just My Code" and "Enable .NET Framework source stepping" , and still the delay occurs. <br><br>However I found this morning that if I download the Silverlight toolkit with source (<a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=19172">http://silverlight.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=19172</a>), build and copy the resulting Microsoft.Windows.Controls.dll and Microsoft.Windows.Controls.pdb to our apps Assemblies folder, the problem is sorted. It may not be nessecary to copy in the pdb.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma">Ashley</font><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
