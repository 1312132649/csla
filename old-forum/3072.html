I know business objects are more efficient than datasets going over the wire, but I am still concerned about speed and impacts of my design.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Say for example I have a master/detail grid. My read only base list is used for the master list which shows partial information as a ReadOnlyBase&lt;MyObjSessionInfo&gt;, when I click on this item I then request a specific item from the business object list and all the details (including child lists) are retrieved as a full blown&nbsp;object&nbsp;and shown in the detail section of the form.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>I know this is a question is dependent on how fast the internet is and how many people are hitting the server, but for a 4k data fetch being performed on the server in the data portal method how would the experience differ from a LAN to an internet connection, given we have a reasonable speed internet line and ping from client to server of 300ms?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Also say security is a concern is it possible to for CSLA to encrypt the connection between itself and the server when serializing objects to be sent over the wire?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Are there better ways I could investigate for my project (i.e. web services)?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Many thanks in advance,<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
