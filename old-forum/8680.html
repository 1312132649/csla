<p>Thanks<br />Jav</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Wednesday, March 17, 2010</h2><p>After testing the data read from the database, things still didn&#39;t work if I used (SafeDataReader)dr.GetBoolean(&quot;@FieldName&quot;), because the nulls were converted to false.</p>
<p>However, if I declared my Properties to be bool? instead of bool, and then used (SafeDataReader)dr.GetValue(&quot;@FieldName&quot;), nulls from the DB were faithfully represented as nulls in the property values and that did th trick.</p>
