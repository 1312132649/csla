In the DataPortal_Create you probably have a ValidationRules.CheckRules() call. Hope this leads you in the right direction. Maybe someone can correct me if I am wrong.</P>

<P>Then you'd add a rule at priority zero to each property. This rule would always return True, but would set e.StopProcessing=True if IsInitialized is False.</P>
<P>All your other rules would then be added at priority 1.</P>
<P>And you'd set the process through threshold to 1 (it defaults to 0).</P>
<P>The end result is that no real rules would run until IsInitialized was set to True.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
