<p>First off, Rocky, I just read about your major event, and I just want to say I wish the best to you. I&#39;ve learned a lot about n-tier architecture and good practices from you and I really appreciate all you&#39;ve done and continue to do! And of course, that goes for the rest of the people working on CSLA as well!</p>
<p><br />Now, to my problemo...</p>
<p><br />I am trying to convert my web page to MVC5, and I&#39;m seeing that all of the versions of CSLA are at 4.5.40 *except* MVC! This one is still at 4.5.10.</p>
<p>Any idea at when this will be updated?</p>
<p><br />I have tried just building from source (csla.web.mvc5 4.5.491), but it&#39;s still a no-go with the data portal (which was working in my webforms project). It&#39;s possible that I am forgetting to configure something properly, but I don&#39;t think so. Usually when I get to this point of the dataportal failing, it is because I do not have all the csla assembly versions match.</p>
<p><br />This is not my forte, so I appreciate any help y&#39;all can give.</p>
<p><br />Thanks,</p>

<p>Rocky is working on Csla.Web.Mvc5 so this will be available soon. </p>
<p>There is some hurdles in the &quot;less then well documented&quot; new ASP.NET Identity. The old SimpleMembershipProvider has been replaced with ASP.NET Identity. </p>
<p>I&#39;d rather go with ASP.NET MVC4 until the issues with ASP.NET Identity and making this work seamlessly is sorted out if you want to use the CslaIdentity and CslaPricipal for authorization. </p>
<p>If you can accept to use the build-in ASP.NET Identity without customization then pick the modelbinder and other support classes into your own Csla.Web.Mvc5 assembly and go with MVC 5. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bill.mybiz replied on Thursday, November 14, 2013</h2><p>Thanks for the update Jonny.</p>
<p><br />I am actually gearing towards MVC5 specifically because of the new Identity framework. I am finally focusing on the web side of my stuff (outside of Business and Silverlight UI layers) and it looks like Identity is the immediate future for MS SSO capabilities. </p>
<p>My kluge plan in the near future was just going to be passing authentication info to the SL app via bridging from Javascript, as I already have my own custom authentication using CslaPrincipal &amp; CslaIdentity within the SL app.The Identity part would just be the SSO without using any _real_ customization...just my subclass of IdentityUser as shown in the standard Identity tutorial app.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>bill.mybiz replied on Thursday, November 28, 2013</h2><p>For all out there in the interworld, this is now working with the pre-release version of CSLA for MVC5 found at the NuGet Gallery:</p>
<p><br />https://www.nuget.org/packages/CSLA-ASP.NET-MVC5/</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, December 02, 2013</h2><p>btw, if anyone has suggestions on how to use the new-style identity stuff in MVC - specifically how to convert old-style custom membership code like in ProjectTracker to the new model, I&#39;d love the help!</p>
<p>From what I can see, MVC 5 breaks all existing identity code outright, and I can&#39;t find a good example of converting a custom membership provider to the new scheme...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TimY replied on Saturday, March 08, 2014</h2><p>If you are still looking for help with implementing the new Identity into CSLA, I&#39;m interested in helping out.</p>
