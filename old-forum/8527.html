<p>issue is that Clone operations are very slow when using Linq and changing underlying BO..</p>
<p>I have a req where i have to clone objects for processing.. But whenever i&#39;m performing the clone operations alongwith linq then full process is very slow.. </p>
<p>I did this to have better performance i.e. instead of loading same objects from db, i thought to use clone but surprisngly result is much slower.. can anbody help in this..</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Can you post a snippet of code that will reproduce this issue. How much longer does it take when linq is involved&nbsp;compared&nbsp;to the non linq method?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
