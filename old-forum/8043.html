The ReadOnlyListBase and ReadOnlyBase objects are ideal other than the fact that I would like to update the list on the fly from within the form. No data however would be written back to the DB via this list as I would use my full business objects for this.<br /><br />How could I create a stereotype of ROLB and ROB but make them writeable from within the UI ?<br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br />Nick</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 24, 2009</h2><P>Why wouldn't you use BusinessBase and BusinessListBase? They are designed to support read-write properties and the ability to add/remove items from a list.</P>
<P>The read-only base classes have no business rules support, limited databinding support and limited authorization support, because they are for read-only data.</P>
<P>To create an editable stereotype you'll end up replicating nearly all of BusinessBase and BusinessListBase except probably for the Save() methods.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>NickTaylor replied on Wednesday, November 25, 2009</h2><P>Hi Rocky,</P>
<P>I guess I wanted to double check that implementing the BB and BLB classes&nbsp;but perhaps not implementing all the methods that&nbsp;the template provides is an acceptable practice. I&nbsp;guess I shouldn't treat the template as a straight&nbsp;jacket, but rather as a starting point which can be customised if required.</P>
<P>In this instance the BB info object only has its Fetch method populated. As there is no requirement to&nbsp;write data back to the DB,&nbsp;no Update / Insert methods are implemented.</P>
<P>Many thanks for your input...</P>
<P>Best regards,</P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>For example, it is quite common to use a BB object as a criteria
object when the user gets to input the criteria. In that case there&#8217;s also no
save, or fetch &#8211; just create. But there are business rules, because the input
is validated and then used as criteria for fetching some other object.</span><b><span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<P>I guess you are having trouble implementing the technique explained in the blog entry</P>
<P>"Rockford Lhotka - I Am Working On My Using CSLA NET 30 Ebook And Wrote Some Content That I Dont Think Im Going To Use In The Book"</P>
<P>I enclose and example. The *-Designer.cs files were generated by a very customized version of CslaGen that even supports the technique above. It was tested on Csla 2.0 and&nbsp;3.7.1.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Tuesday, November 24, 2009</h2><P>Forgot to say this is part of my test bed project and it is used to load a collection of more than 22.000 info objects and does it in around 2 seconds. ReadOnly objects are very fast to load namely because they don't have validation rules. I admit I didn't test similar BusinesBase objects with the same properties and rule checking off... Maybe it's as fast as RO...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>NickTaylor replied on Wednesday, November 25, 2009</h2><P>Hi Tiago,</P>
<P>I will certainly incorporate the methods proposed by Rocky that you described above, however in my scenario I required a little further flexibility. </P>
<P>My customer maintenance form initially contains no data. I then have the usual options to add a new customer, edit a customer etc. etc., and I also provide a search button on the toolbar which opens a search form which then permits the&nbsp;user to select any number of customers, or indeed all customers. I start by&nbsp;displaying a list of all customers&nbsp;which is a simple ( now writable ) list based on BusinessListBase. So thanks to CustomerList.GetAllCustomers() I now see all customers displayed in the search form grid. No problems here.</P>
<P>When the user has selected either all or an assortment of customers, I then create a new list to contain my selected customers, i.e. CustomerList.CreateEmpyList(), and then iterate through the datagrid picking out all the selected rows ( easy to do as I am using an Infragistics ultraGrid, and it has a ListObject property for each grid row ). I then merely add the&nbsp;appropriate customer info objects to the new SelectedCustomerList object.</P>
<P>I then return this to the maintenance form, and use it to drive the forms navigation. Obviously for each navigational movement, I invoke the full BO which then writes any changes back to the DB.&nbsp;Of course adding or deleting customers is easy to maintain in the navigation as I can easily add and remove info objects from the now writable collection.</P>
<P>I'm sure this will work fine, however I have spent most of the day trying to&nbsp;work out how to find a reference to the parent form onto which a bespoke component object has been placed. There is no .Parent property which is understandable, but very annoying!</P>
<P>Any help here would also be welcome!! ;o)</P>
<P>Thanks again,</P>
