<P>If you want to sort on more than one property you can look at the CSLAcontrib project on CodePlex where there's a more advanced version of SortedBindingList, or use a LINQ query.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, July 22, 2009</h2><P>I used the ObjectListView successfully for a few years to sort more than one property at a time. It also filters so it was a nice replacement for both Sorted and Filtered BindingList.</P>
<P>But once LINQ came out I switched completely to it. So depending on your version of .Net you can go either way.</P>
