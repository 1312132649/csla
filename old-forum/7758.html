<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>We have a portal framework that has been developed using CSLA in which the DataPortal has been configured using the App.config file of the portal.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The portal is basically a shell that can contain multiple portlets, each of which is its own standalone application.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>We then created one portlet that also uses CSLA, in which it’s DataPortal has been configured in it’s App.config, differently from the portal’s DataPortal.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The portlet runs fine by itself, but not when it is run within the portal.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The problem is at runtime, when a Fetch call is made to the Business Object used in the portlet, the Business Object uses the <B><I>portal’s</I></B> configuration of the DataPortal and not the <B><I>portlet’s</I> </B>config.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The portal and portlet are in two separate assemblies (portal is an exe and the portlet is a dll).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Is there a way to specify different DataPortal configurations for different assemblies?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>We basically want to specify different DataPortal configurations for the portal and for each portlet, so if we have 4 portlets, we would want 5 configurations (4 portlets + 1 portal).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The reason for this is to completely separate the coding/configuration for each component since the portal and each portlet will be managed by different groups.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Is this possible?</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, October 09, 2009</h2><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/DataPortalFaq.ashx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/DataPortalFaq.ashx</A></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
