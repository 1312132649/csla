<P>Everywhere that I can find, depen(a)nt is an <EM>alternate</EM> spelling for depend(e)nt.&nbsp; So for the new 2.1 <FONT color=#008000>ValidationRules.AddDependantProperty("x", "y")</FONT> it probably ought to be re-spelled <FONT color=#008000>AddDependentProperty</FONT>...</P>
<P>In&nbsp;the book,&nbsp;I couldn't&nbsp;find&nbsp;prior usage of <EM>dependent,</EM> but on page 413 (c# 2005 book):&nbsp; <EM>"Sometimes an object will have properties that are inter<STRONG>dependent</STRONG>, or at least have inter<STRONG>dependent</STRONG> validation logic."&nbsp; </EM>So if for no other reason, this should be re-spelled for consistency with the rest of the book.</P>
<P>Not knowing if I should comment on this at all, I showed this to my wife, an English Literature major, and her respose was, "That's misspelled!"&nbsp; - So here I am posting a niggle... sorry.</P>
<P>I hope this is helpful - and please disregard any spelling errors in my post.&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /></P>

<P>Anyway, I did consider that this would be a breaking change before I posted, but 2.1 hasn't been out a month yet and maybe this feature hasn't been used yet by too many people?&nbsp; </P>
<P>However, if I'm right and the editor of the next book, (assuming another book were to come out) wants to change it then, it is certain to be more of an issue at that time then it is now.</P>
<P>Just a thought...</P>
