<p>My first try at this was to use events to pass the EmployeeViewModel.Model which the part viewmodels would subscribe to and maintain a reference to the model.&nbsp;&nbsp; While Binding works for the views, saving changes does not because of an edit level mismatch.&nbsp; (which i assume is because of the multiple binding sources?)</p>
<p>I thought to try holding a weakreference to the model on each part.&nbsp; I dont remember why i abandonded that, but I believe it worked.&nbsp; I&#39;m not too familiar with weakreference and I&#39;m afraid to incorporate something &quot;just because it works&quot;.&nbsp; Gotta have some basic understandings, first.</p>
<p>But the multiple binding source feature seems like that might solve my issue.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t found much on it except the sample code and a couple of posts referencing it, so i&#39;m not too sure about it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Will it address my problem?&nbsp; Do I just add the BindingSourceExtensions code and use it as the sample does?&nbsp; Why would I not want to use it?</p>
