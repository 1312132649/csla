<p>&nbsp;The same web project behaves differently under Framework 2.0 and Framework 4.0. When the ItemInserting event fires, e.Values is empty when the site runs on IIS with Framework 2.0. </p>
<p>When the ItemInserting event fires with the site hosted in VS 2010 using Framework 4, then e.Values is perfect. </p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>There used to be a bug in the InsertItemTemplate for the ListView control and as I read somewhere it couldn&#39;t be fixed for &quot;performance issues&quot; but would be addressed in the future.&nbsp; This bug existed in ASP.Net 3.5 too I think.</p>
<p>If this is the same issue you are seeing, then it&#39;s a known problem.&nbsp; I guess Microsoft finally fixed it in ASP.Net 4.0 hence its now working.</p>
