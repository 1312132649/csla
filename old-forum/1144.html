<P>Suppose an additional use case is added to ProjectTracker stating a ProjectManager adds Materials to a project - same pattern as a Resource, just a different object.</P>
<P>Would the best approach be to add an additional&nbsp;EditableChildList property (ProjectMaterials)&nbsp;to the Project class </P>
<P>OR </P>
<P>would it be better to create a new Project class that looks exactly like the existing Project class and replace ProjectResources with ProjectMaterials?</P>
<P>OR</P>
<P>something else I'm not considering?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2>I would think the best approach is the first one you specified.&nbsp; It depends on the use case though.&nbsp; You probably will want to edit both resources and materials at the same time and want those changes to all commit at the same time, so I think it makes sense to add materials as a child to project.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
