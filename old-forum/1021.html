<P>I am planning to attend the VS Live 2006 New York event. I am really looking forward to your post conference presentation on CSLA. I have started reading your book on C# Business Objects and still on the learning curve. My question to you is what areas would be covering in the post conference session.Would this be similar to your DNR TV presentation on&nbsp;CSLA using ProjectTracker app as an example.&nbsp;Please let me know.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
