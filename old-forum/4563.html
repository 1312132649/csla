This client ID is also important as it designates which database should be used for all data access. For us, the client ID was part of the user identification and is stored in our custom Identity object. </P>
<P>We use the data access piece of the enterprise library and hence whenever we get a Database object from the database factory we use a User class that exposes a DatabaseName based on the current user's client Id. </P>
<P>Long story short we carry this "additional information" in the identity - though your case may or may not parallel ours, where the client Id really is part of the identification of the current user. </P>
