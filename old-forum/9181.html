<p>The conclusion of that seemed to be that binary WCF with NO&nbsp;zip compression is probably the best configuration.&nbsp; Did I interpret that right, and is that still the thinking?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DanB replied on Saturday, July 10, 2010</h2><p>Anyone?&nbsp; Anyone?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t made any throughtput tests for WCF but I did a lot for remoting with several algorithms. The general rule is:</p>
<p>&quot;compression increases overhead - both in the sender and receiver side&quot;.</p>
<p>I can put it on a different way. For a 100M bit/second medium (network) I didn&#39;t find any compression algorithm that delivers data faster than using uncompressed data. If you haver serious load problems on your network or if you are using a slow medum (say a VPN to a remote location) you might get faster delivery of data because there is less data to transfer.</p>
<p>Hope that helps...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DanB replied on Monday, July 12, 2010</h2><p>Thanks.&nbsp; That seemed to be the conclusion of the testing in the thread I referenced in the original post above.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I just wanted to confirm my understanding of&nbsp;that as the current best practice / recommendation with CSLA.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 12, 2010</h2><p>From my perspective, the recommendation is to do what works. That might sound trite, but it isn&#39;t. Different apps have different requirements, and you should do what works for your app.</p>
<p>My overall personal philosophy is also to use the least technology possible in any given case. So if you don&#39;t need to use compression to make your app work, then you shouldn&#39;t use compression. If you do need it, then you should use it.</p>
<p>With binary XML, compression seems to offer pretty limited benefit, but it does still have some benefit. It also causes overhead, so whether it provides <i>value</i> will depend on your specific scenario.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
