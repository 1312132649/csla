<P>Data requirements aside, do your objects share anything else in common? If so, then perhaps that commonality represents a third type of object which your existing objects can inherit from. If you are intent on inheriting for the sake of minimize data access code, then you can do the same by having a third class that contains the common data access functionality.</P>
<P>Hope that helps!</P>
