When retrieving a large number of BLOB-s in a loop, the code stops with the error message below:<br />Could not connect to net.tcp://localhost:9000/Svc. The connection attempt lasted for a time span of 00:00:00.0468750. TCP error code 10048: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted 127.0.0.1:9000.<br />A netstat -a command displays a huge number of connections to port 9000, and all of them in TIME_WAIT state.<br />Our guess is the TCP/IP channel is continuously open and closed and, to avoid this, we should cache either the proxy, either the underlying TCP/IP connection.<br />Is there a way to do this?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
