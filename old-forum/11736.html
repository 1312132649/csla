<p>I have a parent business base object and a child business base object. &nbsp;The OK button on the edit form is bound to the parent&#39;s issavable property. &nbsp;The grid is bound to the child collection. &nbsp;When I edit the column in the grid, it hits the child&#39;s property just fine and sets the child bo to is dirty. &nbsp;The parent&#39;s reference to the child collection recognizes that the child collection is now dirty. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the ok button does not light up.....it doesn&#39;t seem to be refreshing that binding. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The setting for the binding is on OnPropertyChange.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, December 09, 2012</h2><p>The IsXYZ properties does not implement OnPropertyChanged in CSLA 3.x so this will no work.</p>
<p><b>You should rather set the &lt;Button&gt;.Enabled in the Form by hooking into the &lt;bo&gt;.OnPropertyChanged and &lt;bo&gt;.OnChildChanged events. </b></p>
<p>Databinding in WindowsForms is not so &quot;friendly&quot; for having OnPropertyChanged on all the IsXYZ properties.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
