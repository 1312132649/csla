Without those static tokens, the object factory has no way to call LoadProperty() or ReadProperty(), and that's often quite important.</P>
<P>I'm also not entirely sure the concept will work in Silverlight, due to the limitations on reflection.</P>
<P>The <EM>primary</EM> reason for inventing this whole property syntax (and managed backing fields) was to support Silverlight, so if the technique doesn't work there then it is (to my mind) not useful.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
