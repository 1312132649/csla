<p>I have a strange problem at the moment ,</p>
<p>We are writing a toolkit to allow us to easily use nhibernate as the data layer for CSLA. and we have come across an issue when consuming that collection within Silverlight 5</p>
<p>Where&nbsp; the size of a collection of objects&nbsp; grows massively if we try and save,</p>
<p>for example the collection I am using contains 4000 items and approx 10 fields for each item when loading this object into silverlight&nbsp;fiddler reports the size of the data as 750,000 bytes, however when I then&nbsp;edit&nbsp; one property of one object from 5&nbsp; to 6 and save the data size passed back to the server is now of 3.5 Meg, </p>
<p>I have tried a number of collections and they report the same thing , Now is this normal in silverlight and csla I have to admit never noticing it in a number of previous projects we have written.</p>
<p>Also what is the best way to capture the data before it gets binary encrypted and zipped so I can try and see what the difference between the 2 collections are, </p>
<p>If I override the <span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;">OnDeserialized call the objects look the same, It seems to be addeding extra fluff that is then stripped out again</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;">Any help would be appreciated</span></span></p>

<p>Would the DynamicListBase&lt;T&gt; be a better options for handling edits for your large collection?&nbsp; Then your updates would be for just the items that changed.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, January 31, 2013</h2><p>You should also consider: </p>
<ul>
<li>changing your app to use a read-only list and then do a single edit based on the selection or </li>
<li>look at the DiffGram sample for a possible solution to send only modified objects to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loading that many objets fr the purpose of a single or few edits in the list may not be an optimal solution as CSLA will send the entire list back to the server even when only one/a few items has been modified.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
