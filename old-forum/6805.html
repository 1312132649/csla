I would like to utilize CSLA on non-Microsoft operating systems. I accept the fact that Mono will always be two steps behind Microsoft, but Mono supports enough of the .Net framework to facilitate a wide range of interesting applications. I also realize that Mono does not support many of the 3.0/3.5 .Net additions such as WPF (although it must to a small degree for Moonlight to function). For my current needs, WPF support is not important, nor is WCF. I sincerely appreciate all the tedious data binding support and numerous other great features Rocky (and crew)&nbsp;have implemented and continue to maintain in CSLA.&nbsp; I suspect that the main compatibility issues with CSLA under Mono are centered around Mono not implementing all the .Net data binding nuances (especially DataGrids) and serialization format differences. I have a few ideas on how to attack these perceived problems, but I would love to hear from anyone that has already been down this road.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P>(Please consider this a bump of my posting from a couple days ago as...) I will be heading in the exact same direction, to see if I can work out a Mono/Telerik/CSLA solution perhaps via CodeSmith or my own code generator.&nbsp; This is another reason why I am looking to a minimal CSLA solution just to support data binding&nbsp;- if the full CSLA can't be "certified" for Mono, perhaps we can work out a subset that will work.</P>
