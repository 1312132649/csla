<p>I am hoping someone can guide me on this. I created an asp.net application with CSLA.NET 3.8 as the business object. The application has its own database, and it has its own custom users table and roles that is used for authentication. everything works as expected. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s my problem. On the same application, I have to connect to another database that has an asp.net membership (users table) . I am wondering if its possible to have dual authentication wherein users will be authenticated on both datasources, and user credentials on each databases will be returned as one object. </p>
<p>Looking forward to your responses, and any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
