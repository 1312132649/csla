In one class i have a static method that returns a datatable from database (i'm using data access application block). And then, in Business class i call that method and store datatable. Problem is when want to iterate through rows i get an error:<br /><br />"DataPortal.Fetch failed ( Object reference not set to an instance of an object )<br /><br />And it points to the  "foreach" statement<br /><br />foreach (var row in dt.Rows)<br />        {<br />            int br = System.Convert.ToInt32(((DataRow)row)["Id"]);<br />            Console.Write(br);<br />            this.Add(product.returnProduct(br));<br />        }<br /><br />I really don't know what to do or wher the problem is. I would appreciate any help.<br /><br />Luka</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 20, 2009</h2>You should use the debugger to find out what is null. Probably the DataTable from the look of your code.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
