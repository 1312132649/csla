<P>I have downloaded your project and I think you have done a great job. We are&nbsp;currently working at Eurowise to create NHIbernate templates for Code Complete and we have not yet decided on a "pattern" to use. Yours looks as a good option but, at first sight,&nbsp; looks complicated to use for Code Generation. AM I wrong in assuming that?</P>
<P>Regards</P>
