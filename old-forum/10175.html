I&#39;m new to the site, really liking CSLA and the rules engine especially.</p>
<p>I&#39;m running CSLA 4.1. I have a question about GetAllBrokenRules. I&#39;m adding some Warning and Information results, but they are not showing up in the tree when I GetAllBrokenRules. Only errors will show here. If I have only Warning/Info results, the broken rules tree is empty. Based on what I&#39;ve read in other posts, I believe it should not be this way. What could be going wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

GetAllBrokenRules indeed only returns results with severity error. It&#39;s coded that way, but I think that has to be a mistake. It would render results of severity Warning or Information completely useless, as there seems to be no other way to get at them later. Am I correct?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
