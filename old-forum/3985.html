<P><FONT face=Arial>If using CSLA, would a good design include creating a read only list class, say UIElementList that had a child collection of UIElementItem’s?&nbsp; The UIElementItem would correlate to a UI control, for example a text box or radio button list, and have properties correlating to what is needed to create the UI.&nbsp; UIElementList’s responsibility would then be to display the UI elements.&nbsp; If taking this approach, would manually looping through the collection to create the UI be the only option or would direct data binding be possible?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If anyone has an alternative approach, I would be interested in hearing about it.&nbsp; Thanks.</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Thursday, December 06, 2007</h2><P>I kind of did something similar (albeit in a Windows form) when I was creatting a dynamic UI for selecting Reports.&nbsp; Depending on the report chosen, the selection criteria available differed.</P>
<P>So I created a Report object with ReportParams child objects, looped through them to see what type of control I should draw on the form and then bound that control to a&nbsp;property on my business object to remember&nbsp;what value they'd chosen as the parameter.</P>
<P>I happended to store these in a SQL database but an XML file is just as good.</P>
<P>I also stored some SQL code for any parameters that needed lookup data (e.g. list of countries if the report had a country filter)&nbsp;- so I could populate a combo control with values.&nbsp; That was a bit rubbish and lazy but if I'd had a bit more time I'd have made it use a lookup business object instead.</P>

<P>Each User Control can then be as simple or as complex as required.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
