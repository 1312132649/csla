<P>The ClickOnce support in Visual Studio has been nice during development, but at least on the surface it seems limited in flexibility. You have no control over the install location, the shortcuts are obfuscated, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to have a "wizard" or install helper run as part of the installation. </P>
<P>I also ran into an issue where hosting the install on two different servers caused the application "update" from one server to apply an obsolete copy from the other, as well as at least two clients in which the application wouldn't run from where ClickOnce located it, but it would run if you just copied the directory contents somewhere else. </P>
<P>Any input welcomed. Thanks!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
