<p>I have been looking for a framework or .NET Control that provide Excel Like Grid Control that will work with CslaDataSource with minimum effort.</p>
<p>I examined the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>YUI,<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>ExtJS,<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>jQuery,<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Coolite,<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>EssentialObjects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, thought its not free, but worth the value, I found EO.Web Grid Control that satisfied all my requirements. See this link below:</p>

<p>The great thing is that it worked with CslaDataSource right out of the box without any additional work.</p>
<p>If you have to use ExtJS for example, you would have to serialize Csla Object to provide JSON feed for the ExtJS Store Consumers for example.</p>
<p>I hope this will help others who require similar features.</p>
