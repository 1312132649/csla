Currently I am using 1.x</P>
<P>When I edit an item in a child business collection, I only get a byval copy of the item. I change it and then have to delete the original and put the new item into the collection. Now when I save, I have delete the original in the db, and put in a new one. This can be a real headache if I have db constraints due to foriegn keys pointing to the child collection objects.</P>
<P>Am I doing this all wrong or is there a way to directly change the child object in the child collection instead of replacing it and so then I only have to do an update in the db.</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Thursday, March 29, 2007</h2>I think you might be thinking of VB.NET in VB6 terms.&nbsp; There are two types of objects in .NET: value types and reference types.&nbsp; Value types are ints, bools, enums and the like.&nbsp; Reference types are full blown classes, such as CSLA objects.&nbsp; When reference types are passed by value, the reference to the object is what is copied, not the object itself.&nbsp; So just modify the item in your collection and save the collection.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jhw replied on Thursday, March 29, 2007</h2><P>Yes, I just worked through the collection to get the index of the item I want to modify and set that item point to the new modified item. </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sorry to jump in here off topic but I couldn't find a way to email you directly. I need to implement the whole Grandchild collection scheme you guys were posting about and was wondering if I could please have a copy of the SafeDataRowReader class (C#). It would be a big help. Is it posted online somewhere?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Thanx!</FONT></P>
