That would add unnecesary overhead (auth, rules, etc). It may even crash if the current user is not allowed to set one of the properties for that object, which is a common scenario.<br>Suppose a user can read all of the props, but can only write to just a few. Loading the object would instantly crash for no good reason.<br>Also, some property changes may trigger other validations for other properties, so you may be validating the same thing more than once unnecesarily.<br><br>What most people do is set the fields directly and call ValidationRules.CheckRules() at the end of the process.<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ballistic replied on Thursday, January 11, 2007</h2>Thank you.&nbsp; That makes sense.<BR><BR>As you can tell, I'm just getting started and I figured we always used the public properties to enforce validation.<BR><BR>I appreciate your input!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
