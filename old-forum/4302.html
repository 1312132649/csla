CSLA has come up as a choice. Colleges have come up with some question. <br>How can we compare CSLA with the building blocks / factories of Microsoft.<br>How would logging and especially caching be implemented. <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Wednesday, February 06, 2008</h2><P>As has been said before, they solve two very different problems and do so in a complimentary manner. </P>
<P>We currently use the logging block with our application (and the exception handling and data-access block). We opted to not use the caching block because the ASP.Net caching solution is better in certain respects. </P>
<P>So don't think of it as a comparison - think of both CSLA and the Microsoft ECL (app blocks) as two tools that can both be used to build your application.</P>
<P>Good luck,</P>

I don't have that link available at this time but I will look for it.&nbsp; Just so you know, we are currently working with a WinForm app. No web at this time.<br><br>There is also an <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=de524642-d7be-422b-9aaa-bc77c36ece6e">article</a> that Rocky wrote some time ago which may help you too.<br><br>John<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
