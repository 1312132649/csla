Actually two of them, neither based on a custom generation engine. The first one was for CSLA 1.x and uses the code DOM, the second is for 2.0 and uses straight text output to escape the limitations of the code DOM.</P>
<P>These generators are built with the intent of augmenting Magenic's consultants as they work on projects, and the generator stays behind with the client when our consultants leave. But my point is that they aren't designed for "casual use" like CodeSmith; meaning no docs, a UI that lacks polish, etc. The tools aren't designed to compete with other code-generators, but rather to allow Magenic to compete with lower-cost consulting firms.</P>
<P>Which is a really long-winded way of heading off the next question, which is whether I can make FBOG available. I can't. Magenic owns it, not me, and they provide it as part of their consulting services only.</P>
<P>What I've been working on, off and on, is trying to come up with a new language for describing objects. Perhaps I'm on a fool's errand, but I look at the amount of code required to write an object, even with CSLA, and I think it is ridiculous. If you go through your code and identify only the lines of code that perform actual business functions - that have actual business value - you'll find that it is perhaps 4%. The rest of the lines of code are mandated by C# or VB or ADO.NET or Windows Forms or Web Forms or whatever. All "plumbing", and none of it valuable to the business need.</P>
<P>How does this tie into code-gen? A compiler is merely a fancy code generator. If I can come up with a more concise language to describe business objects (at least CSLA business objects), then I can code-gen CIL directly by creating a compiler for my language.</P>
<P>Thus far though, I have not been happy with any results <img src="/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad [:(]" /></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>zythra replied on Thursday, June 29, 2006</h2>Thanks for the reply Rocky.<br><br>This has been an interesting thread, if anything it has given me a little more insight as to what others are attempting to do.<br><br>Currently all of my code is generated, well, obviously not all, but everything that is redundant and can be reasonably generated&nbsp; The company I work for uses their own proprietary framework along with their own proprietary generator.&nbsp; It all works very well and I really like it, but I can't use it outside of projects for them, sort of like FBOG and Magenic.<br><br>All of my side work has been NHibernate using a generator I wrote that is entirely table driven (which I hate doing).&nbsp; It uses NVelocity templates.<br><br>Another gentleman and I have been working on a generator for CSLA and as soon as we feel it is ready, then I will be doing all of my contract work with generated CSLA code.&nbsp; Our new generator uses XSLT templates and is coming along quite well.&nbsp; My friend has done all of the work so far and he's done a great job.<br><br>Anyway, it's good to hear other ideas and to hear what you are using Rocky.<br><br>Dustin :-)<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, June 30, 2006</h2>It would seem that a code generator would could raise, say a Visio document, and is aware of Csla would be a good way to generate code.&nbsp; Has anyone gone down this path?<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Friday, June 30, 2006</h2>From my experience a couple years ago, the Visio object model seemed to be a mess, and it was difficult to get information out of it.&nbsp; Maybe that has changed in recent releases though.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, June 30, 2006</h2>It didn't have to necessarly be Visio, although I think newer releases include some kind of built in code generator.&nbsp; I haven't played with it though..<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom Cooley replied on Friday, June 30, 2006</h2>I've always thought that a UML-driven approach makes the most sense. Something like a Visio model or some other tool. I've not used Rational or any of the other high-end suites but I would imagine that some form of code-gen exists in these tools. So far, I have not found anything within my price range.<br><br>So, I have been using CodeSmith. My company has not yet switched to .Net 2 (coming soon) so I'm using the templates originally created by Matt Altadonna but then ported to C# by Ricky Supit. I've made a lot of changes to these templates to help reduce the amount of code changes needed, but I still feel they fall considerably short. One of primary issues for me is that they are only driven by tables. We all use (or should use) stored procedures to interact with a database and the result sets these stored procedures often do not structurally match the root table with which they interact. There are often joins to replace/augment foreign key values and multiple result sets and such and this is where table-driven code gen just falls apart.<br><br>When Ricky recently released his templates for CSLA 2, this feature was still not there. However, because he had completely rewritten the templates, he made it much, much easier to add this support than would have been possible with templates for CSLA 1. I offered to add that support and it is now available.<br><br>For business objects whose responsibility it is to maintain data (and many of them fall into this category), code gen makes sense. For me anyway, now that I can do this from stored procedures, my work load is getting a little easier. In fact, I am generating much of the code for my CSLA 1 business objects using the CSLA 2 templates. It's by no means a perfect system as I generate the same class from both sets of templates and then mash them together through cut/paste. But it still beats the alternative of hand-coding all the repetative portions of a class.<br><br>Tom<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 30, 2006</h2>

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=728155214-30062006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>The reason is that UML tends to lead people down a

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=728155214-30062006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>Additionally, UML class diagrams don't convey behavior. 
There's no semantic meaning there. So to do real code generation with UML you 
must do at least two diagrams for every class (class, activity) and usually 
others as well. UML does have 11 diagrams, and to completely describe a system 
you need to do all of them...</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

This has always been a home grown method<br>
I started by generating for CSLA for VB6 and then moved to CSLA 1.x<br>
<br>
Right now, I am generating pretty much all of the classes, (parent,
child collection, and child), name value lists, etc. I also generate
all the stored procedures and a basic MDI child form and dialogs with
all the fields on the forms.<br>
<br>
The stored procedures that I generate also include corporate standards for generating audit information etc.<br>
<br>
So the home grown code generation approach works very well, BUT....<br>
<br>
My concern is that code generation seems to be missing the behaviour
aspect of OO and I am wondering how you can get that from meta data or
ER diagrams.<br>

<P>You can only take automated code generation from an ERD a certain distance, and then that's it.</P>
<P>(It's farther than many people think,&nbsp;particularly if you supplement it with a behaviour-oriented meta-model that contains keywords or phrases to watch out for in the entity, attribute or relationship names.)</P>
<P>For example, I once wrote a program that would deduce candidate business rules from a data model.&nbsp; Example: rules like start&lt;something&gt; or begin&lt;something&gt; needs to be less than or equal to end&lt;something&gt;.&nbsp;&nbsp; I identified quite a few commonly recurring business rule patterns and would load the candidate rules into a meta-structure (where I could approve/disapprove them).&nbsp; Other candidate rules would include a no-overlapping records rule: identified by&nbsp;a table that contained a multi-column primary or unique key, where the leading portion of the key was an foreign key&nbsp;to the parent table and the trailing columns contained a start&lt;something&gt; or begin&lt;something&gt; kind of column name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, the rule finder&nbsp;was a specification generator.&nbsp; From there, a code generator build the data access layer with its associated validation logic.&nbsp; (No complaints about where the code was - I wasn't using OO languages then. :)</P>
<P>With a little extra data stored about the relationships and a meta-data keyword repository, it's fairly straightforward to deduce which entities need to be maintained from the same screen.&nbsp; For example, Invoice Header and Invoice Line Item will often be maintained together, whereas Invoice Header and Invoice Type will not.&nbsp; That can be deduced because although all three entities share the same root word (Invoice) and would be connected via&nbsp;a chain of one-to-many relationships - Invoice Type contains a word that denotes a category or&nbsp;grouping of meta-data about Invoices, whereas Invoice Header does not.&nbsp; (It could be tuned by placing a &lt;put them together&gt; or &lt;split them apart&gt; code in the relationship meta-data.) I would pull these candidate maintenance screen data elements out of a data model via a utility program and put them into a meta-model that defined the screens' purpose and data usages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From there, further automated transformations (supplemented with manual enhancements and special hand-coded business logic) would turn them into code.</P>
<P>Now that I'm in the .Net world instead of the Oracle Forms world, I'm having to re-build my repository and code generation infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm looking for some good xml or relational meta-models that are already in use for holding object specifications - or I'll roll my own if need be.</P>
<P>(Feel free to point me in the right direction!)</P>
<P>&nbsp;I'm planning on adapting the techniques I used to mine an ERD to build candidate OO business object and maintenance/review screen specifications.&nbsp; From there, I'll supplement the meta-model by hand and by utility, then generate the code.&nbsp; CodeSmith looks to be an affordable way to short-circuit some of that work. :)</P>
<P>The key for me is to find my sea-legs with OO-based design.&nbsp; The CSLA book and forum have really helped me get a better grip on good OO design, and that will help guide me in building my new specification generators.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Friday, June 24, 2011</h2><p>Rocky is dead on in his reply in my experience.</p>

<p>Yes, Magenic has a code generator called FBOG. Actually two of them, neither based on a custom generation engine. The first one was for CSLA 1.x and uses the code DOM, the second is for 2.0 and uses straight text output to escape the limitations of the code DOM.</p>
<p>These generators are built with the intent of augmenting Magenic&#39;s consultants as they work on projects, and the generator stays behind with the client when our consultants leave. But my point is that they aren&#39;t designed for &quot;casual use&quot; like CodeSmith; meaning no docs, a UI that lacks polish, etc. The tools aren&#39;t designed to compete with other code-generators, but rather to allow Magenic to compete with lower-cost consulting firms.</p>
<p>Which is a really long-winded way of heading off the next question, which is whether I can make FBOG available. I can&#39;t. Magenic owns it, not me, and they provide it as part of their consulting services only.</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve been working on, off and on, is trying to come up with a new language for describing objects. Perhaps I&#39;m on a fool&#39;s errand, but I look at the amount of code required to write an object, even with CSLA, and I think it is ridiculous. If you go through your code and identify only the lines of code that perform actual business functions - that have actual business value - you&#39;ll find that it is perhaps 4%. The rest of the lines of code are mandated by C# or VB or ADO.NET or Windows Forms or Web Forms or whatever. All &quot;plumbing&quot;, and none of it valuable to the business need.</p>
<p>How does this tie into code-gen? A compiler is merely a fancy code generator. If I can come up with a more concise language to describe business objects (at least CSLA business objects), then I can code-gen CIL directly by creating a compiler for my language.</p>
<p>Thus far though, I have not been happy with any results <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad" />" /></p>

<p>JCardina, In my opinion CRUD code generation is not helpful but like Rocky mentioned above there may be some oppurtunities for code generation.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you give a try to CslaGenFork?

There are some really good code generators out there, several of which include templates for (or directly target) CSLA .NET.</p>
<p>I&#39;d much rather foster a code generation ecosystem around CSLA than attempt to become a competitor to those generators. I think that&#39;s better for CSLA and for the community as a whole.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ashraf Ali replied on Friday, June 24, 2011</h2><p>I am sorry I don&#39;t follow&nbsp;what does a&nbsp;&quot;code generation ecosystem&quot; mean? <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" />, I do like the sound of it.</p>
