<p>&nbsp;I&#39;ve trying for some time now to get the WCF compression working on a full .net application, I keep doing something wrong I can&#39;t event compile it, I have the silverlight example from the videos source code how about a .net example ?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 10, 2010</h2><p>The .NET data portal doesn&#39;t offer the compression options provided by the SL data portal. This is because there are readily available WCF bindings that do compression, and it is preferable to use those bindings than the approach&nbsp;used in SL.</p>
<p>We only did what we did in the SL data portal because there were no compressed bindings for SL WCF when we created CSLA .NET for Silverlight. Sergey is in the process of providing an alternate proxy/host model for 3.8.3 and 4.0 that defers all the SL data portal processing to WCF too, because there are now good options for compressed bindings in SL3 - and the current SL data portal model prevents them from really working the way you&#39;d expect...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
