<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to provide a UI search facility where the user can search for account names using wild cards (i.e. those with &#39;Santos&#39; as Last Name).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UI will show a DataRepeater with the matching Customer Names (Read-Only Root Collection). Each Customer Name will have their own DataGridView showing the Purchases (Read-Only Child Collection) of the respective customer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is possible, can you please help me with a simple example? Thank you.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Saturday, June 12, 2010</h2><p>I don&#39;t understand why you want this object to be a root object, why cannot this just be a standard ROL? <br />If saving is important, then what would be wrong with a BLB with a BB that contains only read-only properties?</p>
<p>Can the user ever save the collection, based on what I&nbsp;interpret it appears to be only for viewing. You could either have a factory that passes in the search criteria or if you have already fetched the objects could be filtered using either LINQ / FilteredBindingList depending on your preference in the UI.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I am missing something?&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>superkuton replied on Saturday, June 12, 2010</h2><p>Yes, I want a Read-Only List/Collection, so saving is unnecessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to display a list of Read-Only Parent List, each with a Read-Only Child List. In a DataRepeater control, the parent will be displayed in textboxes, while the children will be displayed in a datagridview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me with some samples. Thank you.</p>
