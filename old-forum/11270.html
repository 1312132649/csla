<p>But, both of those projects throw exceptions when I try to run them.&nbsp; I assume this is some sort of config issue, but have no idea what the framework requires to get these projects running.<br /><br />The&nbsp;Membership project throws an exception in MyPrincipal.Login (DataPortal.Fetch failed). There is a web.config file in this project, but it contains no entries for connect strings.<br /><br />The Permissions project fails in CustomIdentityFactory.PermissionFetch (&quot;the underlying provider failed on Open&quot;). This project has an app.config file, and that file does contain two connection strings (one for SecurityDb, and one for SecurityEntities).&nbsp; But, I get the same exception, even after replacing the connection string in the sample (by pointing it to my copy of security.mdf).</p>
<p>Are there any FAQ&#39;s, or Readme&#39;s, or hints for the Samples...so they can actually be run?&nbsp; <br /><br />Or, are they just static code examples, not meant to actually be run as applications or demos?</p>
<p>FWIW, I&#39;ve&nbsp;worked with earlier versions of CSLA for a number of years, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m unfamiliar with the framework.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>From time to time I go through and remove samples that don&#39;t work, but I didn&#39;t have time to do that for 4.3.</p>
<p>The best samples and information on how to get authentication working is in the <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration</em> book.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GaryG replied on Friday, March 30, 2012</h2><p>Thanks, Rocky.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#39;ve recently ordered both of the &quot;Data&quot; e-books, and downloaded the sample code from each. I&#39;m just getting stared with the books, but I&#39;m really digging all the new features in the framework.</p>
