<p>Why do rocky make suggest two database ( one for app ) and one for security database ?</p>
<p>Is there any explanation for this ?? reasons ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Thursday, June 14, 2012</h2><p>Hi Stefanus,</p>
<p>There are some reasons I can think of:</p>
<ol>
<li>use integrated authentication on some scenarios and just don&#39;t use the security datanase</li>
<li>use the same security database for two or more instances of the same application (different departments, but IT board member must have access to all of them)</li>
<li>use the same security database for several different applications</li>
</ol>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>In the early 2000&#39;s we had Active Directory Application Mode (<i>ADAM</i>) that later became Active Directory Lightweight Directory Service (<i>AD LDS</i>).</p>
<p>Today we still have ASP.NET Membership Provider, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yh26yfzy.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yh26yfzy.aspx</a> and the WebMatrix WebSecurity that wraps a membership provider. </p>
<p>The ProjectTracker sample uses the membership provider for users and roles.</p>
