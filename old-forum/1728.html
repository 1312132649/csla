Even though the duplicate value is not passed through the data portal and persisted to the database, it is momentarily still in memory and viewable to the user.&nbsp; How may I ensure that the in-memory business object removed the bad duplicate value?<br><br>Thank you,<br>John Spurlin<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, November 09, 2006</h2>Well, usually you disable the save button, and give an indication to the user that the duplicate rule is broken.&nbsp; Its up to the user to then remove the duplicate.<br><br>HTH<br>andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
