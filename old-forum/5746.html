Is it possible to add Authorization rules to collection objects? <br /><br />Eg.<br /><br />If i have a parent object which contains a collection of child objects, how would one authorize a user to add or remove child objects from the collection ? Or is this a sign of a bad object model? <br /><br />Thanks</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, November 06, 2008</h2>Well, one thing is to make sure to properly Set AllowAdd, AllowEdit, and AllowDelete on the BLB subclass.&nbsp; Also, you'll want to override RemoveItem and InsertItem, I believe.&nbsp; You'll have to throw exceptions here.&nbsp; The child to be contained in the BLB must also add it's own authorization rules so that properties on the child instance can't be changed.<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
