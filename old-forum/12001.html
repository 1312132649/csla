<p>A DynamicListBase is by definition a parent object that automatically saves it&#39;s &quot;root&quot; objects contained in the list. It makes no sense to have a parent property on this list.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>thaehn replied on Tuesday, June 04, 2013</h2><p>Jonny,</p>
<p>To me, the Parent is the object that hosts the object; it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the steriotype.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 04, 2013</h2><p>The way CSLA thinks about a &quot;Parent&quot; is not simply&nbsp;an object reference&nbsp;- it is a real parent-child relationship (also known as containment).</p>
<p>DynamicListBase implements aggregation, not containment, and so the Parent property would be misleading.</p>
<p>What is the scenario where your root object needs to know that it was loaded as part of a collection?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>thaehn replied on Wednesday, June 05, 2013</h2><p>I have a &quot;getter&quot; object at the root which holds all my lists (product types, codes, etc.) and my business object root as I load everything I need up front in Silverlight when I open a new view.&nbsp; The business object is a dynamic list of root business objects.&nbsp; I lazy load another list on the business object when selected in the UI through data binding.&nbsp; I need access to the list of product types in the &quot;getter&quot; object in order to pass it into the data portal through a criteria object.&nbsp; Typicaly I reference the Parent object to get to the root &quot;getter&quot; object that has my lists on it.&nbsp; I also sometimes need access to the &quot;getter&quot; object in business rules where I only have a refernece to the target and not the &quot;getter&quot; object.&nbsp; I have been using the DynamicListBase for an interface simular to Billy Hollis&#39;s Temp Agency demo application.&nbsp; By having the business objects referenced on the main form for the module, I can tell if they are new, dirty, etc. even though they are actually being edited in another viewmodel/view.</p>
