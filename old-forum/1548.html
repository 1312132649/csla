I'm using NameValueList to cache UI Settings etc and would like to take advantage of this libraries memory management features :)

<P>I'm just curious why singletons within the NameValueLists aren't an appropriate solution for you. Am I missing something?</P>

Found this post which got me thinking about the System.Web.Caching library.

<P><EM>Rocky: "Regarding your second point, on the web server, there is a very viable solution there: System.Web.Caching. Microsoft has already built a good caching solution that you can use within ASP.NET. This is often preferable to the Shared/static approach I used in the book because their Cache mechanism will flush itself if the system starts to run low on memory. You can still use the same basic coding structure as I did in the book - just replace the use of a Shared/static field with calls to System.Web.Caching and you are ready to roll." </EM></P>
