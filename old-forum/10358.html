<p>I got it to run, but I see where it uses data from xml files. Which is fine as a sample, but I don&#39;t see a database and I don&#39;t see any comments on how to switch to a database. In fact, there really isn&#39;t any documentation on this sample that I can find. </p>
<p>So, I am stuck now, not knowing how to proceed. I&#39;d really like to plug the sample code into a matching database. And the less work on my part, the better.</p>
<p>Can someone provide some guidance to my specific points/questions above?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 10, 2011</h2><p>Unfortunately right now the best example is a moving target. I&#39;m in the process of completing the MVC UI for ProjectTracker as part of the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series. The current code includes a partial MVC UI, a mock data layer, and a partial EF data layer - all based on the code structures from the&nbsp;<em>Using CSLA 4: Data Access</em> ebook.</p>
