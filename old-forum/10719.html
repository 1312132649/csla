This is the first time it &nbsp;happened to me where it saved successfully but my objectstatus in my detail still thinks that it is still NEW and DIRTY.</p>
<p>Any idea on what&#39;s going on?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, September 27, 2011</h2><p>Hi, </p>
<p>Save return a new object. So you your code should be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obj = obj.Save();</p>
<p>Otherwise, you would bind the old object to the UI that is still New and Dirty.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>maridob replied on Wednesday, September 28, 2011</h2><p>Hi JonnyBee, thanks for the reply. Actually, it was stupid overlook - of binding name error. Oooops!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>maridob replied on Wednesday, September 28, 2011</h2><p>.. but your suggestion is correct that whenever you call the BO save you have to get the new object back.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
