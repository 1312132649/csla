<P>-&gt; use a time out <BR>Just let the handler go or ignore it when it the callback is made;</P>
<P>-&gt; give direct an identity back to the caller<BR>This way the caller (UI) can pass it when calling an second factory method or command like canceling or asking the progress information, but then the server must know what to do with it.<BR><BR>Any suggestions?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 17, 2009</h2><P>All you can really do is ignore the callback.</P>
<P>There's nothing in the WCF proxy for cancelling a server call, so I don't think there's any way to actually do a meaningful cancel of the operation - all you can do is have the client app ignore whatever result you get back.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
