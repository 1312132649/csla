<P>I have been building a rather large web app with C# 2.0, SQL Server 2005 and CSLA version 2.1.4.</P>
<P>I have not had the time to keep up with all the change logs but&nbsp;would like to upgrade to .net 3.5 and CSLA.net version 3.5.2. I'm wondering if anybody has done this big version jump and are there any issues I should be aware of?</P>
<P>Basically&nbsp;I guess I'm wondering if CSLA.net version 3.5.2 is backwards capatible with version 2.1.4 ?</P>
<P>thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Tuesday, November 11, 2008</h2>I've been able to migrate from 2 to 3.5.2 with only minor changes to my classes.&nbsp; It isn't complely backward compatible, but pretty close.&nbsp; I think looking through the change logs for breaking changes would be a good starting point.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, November 11, 2008</h2><P>I plan to make this jump in a month or so.</P>
<P>The only issue I have really found is the spelling change for:</P>
<P>AddDependantProperty to AddDependentProperty</P>
<P>And the compiler flags them&nbsp;for you anyway.</P>
<P>The older style code should all still work.</P>
<P>Making the jump to Managed Properties is a whole other matter. I may only do that for new BOs that I create. Going back and fixing up all the old ones is a large task with a lot of associated risk and re-testing. </P>
<P>But if you ever plan to use Silverlight then you should also use Managed Properties to make things easier. You can do it without them but then you have to write code for Serialize and Deserialize for each BO.</P>

I believe 2.1.4 was a bit more forgiving on this.<br><br>And using Linq2Sql/Linq2EF and Linq2Objects may simplify a lot of your DAL code and BO code. <br><br>&nbsp;/jonnybee<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RangerGuy replied on Wednesday, November 12, 2008</h2><P>So it doesn't seem to be all that bad..thanks everybody that replied.... I'm excited to start learning and working with .net 3.5.</P>

This helps you find UI errors (especially in Windows Forms), but it is a common type of error, and you may find yourself fixing a lot of UI issues you didn't necessarily know you had.</P>
<P>Of course if you have a web UI or XML service interface this is probably a non-issue.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RangerGuy replied on Thursday, November 13, 2008</h2><P>Hi Rocky,</P>
<P>Thanks for the heads up... We have a 100% Web UI so the n-level undo is a none issue i believe.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
