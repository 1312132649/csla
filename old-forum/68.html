Due to the nature of the app, I need to make some of those projects work as plugins, so they're not statically referenced, but rather dinamically loaded by the main app if the dll is in the correct folder.<br>All projects reside in subfolders whithin the same parent folder and all of them are set to use ..\bin as output folder in the compile options.<br>All this works just fine. I have one problem though and it's that while I'm testing, hitting F5 will only compile the main project and the ones that are statically referenced by it. If I make a change to one of those "plugin" projects and hit run the app, the change will not show... I have to manually build the plugin project and then start debugging the app.<br><br>Now, I know that there is a way to force that unreferenced project to compile always because I've seen it done in other projects, but I can't find the damn parameter!<br><br>Any clues?<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, May 11, 2006</h2>Have you tried going to Project -&gt; Project Dependencies.&nbsp; You should be able to manually setup build dependencies.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Thursday, May 11, 2006</h2>Yes, I saw that, and tried it, but it doesn't work.<br>I'm also trying to compare my solution the another one that does what I want and it doesn't use that project dependencies thing. <br><br>(Which I'm not sure what's the point of it, since it doesn't recompile!! wtf. sorry.)<br><br><br>Andrés</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, May 11, 2006</h2>Hmm...

Thanks for your reply.<br>I thought it would work, but it didn't. I have VS pro, and it doesn't have the Configuration Manager.<br>Hitting F5 starts compiling only what "appears to be needed". If I alter the other projects i need to either rebuild them or rebuild the solution.<br><br>No, I'm not using CAB (I guess I need to look into that, don't I?). I'm kind of developing a UI system. Similar to the way sharp develop works, but not that complex. (SD uses xml files for plugins and extensions to the menu and other things. My components do not have / need that deep level of interaction, so I'm trying to keep it simple.)<br><br>One more thing I find strange is that I'm using "..\..\bin" as compilation folder, but when debugging the app it starts from "bin\" which makes the app and the plugins be in separate places...<br>This isn't such a big issue, because I only load plugins once and the code is in one place, but it forces me to do a "#If DEBUG Then" block...<br><br>Also, setting a different folder as output only puts one version of the files in that place. I'm figuring it leaves the debug build in "bin\" and the release in "..\..\bin". Does anyone know if this is right?<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bayu replied on Monday, May 15, 2006</h2>I see ...<br><br>Guess it's NAnt time then ... :-)<br><br>Bayu<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
