The problem is I use&nbsp;AuthorizeDataPortal to reconstruct the user/roles and it does work for using WCF but when using HTTP Portal it returns immediately from&nbsp;DataPortalController without doing the fetch or any command i&#39;m trying to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any help would be appreciated</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jteneglio replied on Tuesday, October 28, 2014</h2>Ok so there was no problems with csla, it was my issue. 

Si now that it is working i noticed that the http proxy is a noticeably slower than the wcf version. Is it me?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, October 28, 2014</h2><p>Can you post what the issue was and your solution?&nbsp; It might be helpful to others still even if it wasn&#39;t the Csla framework.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jteneglio replied on Friday, October 31, 2014</h2><p>I&#39;m a bit ashamed of myself, the problem was, although it was not easy to find, that the assembly/name of my windows phone projects were not the same as .Net projects so because of that the serialization was not working right... I know I know beginner&#39;s mistake, but still it was hard to discover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the HTTP Portal is used i noticed that it was a lot slower than WCF, anybody noticed it?</p>
