<p>This is primarily a bug fix release, and should be quite stable.</p>
<p>The only non-bug change is an enhancement to the Silverlight data portal, allowing the creation of completely custom proxy/host pairs. It is now possible to create a completely different data portal channel that is not necessarily based off WcfProxy. </p>
<p>This change was made primarily to support an upcoming set of custom channels that use a commercial WCF extension, but it is a good change overall, since it also enables the use of TCP sockets or other communication technologies that might exist for Silverlight.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
