<P>Most business object design and code issues are identical on both platforms. And I suspect most SL apps will be n-tier, so the data access issues will be absolutely identical because it is all .NET.</P>
<P>So the only area of major difference is the UI and some data binding issues. While those are absolutely valid topics of conversation, creating a forum for that purpose would require creating separate Web Forms, Windows Forms, ASP.NET MVC, WPF, Silverlight, Workflow, and service forums :)</P>
<P>Obviously there are some SL-only and .NET-only framework bugs and issues. But again, there's quite a lot of shared code between the two versions of CSLA, and most bugs actually end up needing to be resolved in both locations (or fixing code on one side fixes the other, because many code files are directly shared).</P>
<P>All that said, if it becomes a problem to have one forum I an add another. I am not sure I can email enable another one. This old version of Community Server does that, but it is pretty complex to configure. Sadly, I'm told it is many, many hours of work (2-3 days) to upgrade to the current version of the software, so that's not in the cards right now unless I can find someone willing to put in the time/effort to upgrade the software/database/etc.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
