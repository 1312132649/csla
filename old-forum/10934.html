<p>I&#39;m sorry before that I post on this forum, because I&#39;m fell happy with this community.</p>
<p>First I&#39;m quoted your statement from :</p>
<p>http://bxf.codeplex.com/discussions/239182</p>
<p>/////////</p>
<p>The basic design of Bxf places responsibility for creating the view 
in the view factory, and for displaying the view within a &quot;container&quot; in
 the code that handles the IPresenter events (i.e. your shell).</p>
<p>For a modal dialog, or any other dialog, your shell code (the 
IPresenter handlers) needs to supply the &quot;container&quot; that displays the 
view. In WPF this container is typically a Window that contains a 
ContentControl, and that is displayed modally. Literally,
 you should create a &quot;ModalDialog&quot; window .xaml file, and your 
OnShowView code will modally display an instance of ModalDialog.</p>
<p>The view is no different than any view. All views are UserControl 
objects that can be hosted in a container. It doesn&#39;t matter if the view
 will be in a modal window or in a region of an existing window - the 
view shouldn&#39;t care how/where it is displayed.</p>
<p>This means that the code in OnShowView will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an instance of the ModalDialog container window </li>
<li>Set 
the ModalDialog object&#39;s Content property (or whatever you call the 
property used to set the content of the container&#39;s 
ContentControl.Content property) to the view.ViewInstance
</li>
<li>Modally display/show the ModalDialog container window </li>
</ol>
<p>///////////</p>
<p>I&#39;m confuse with point no 1 until 3 =&gt; Why Presenter Display a view /&nbsp; concrete window ?? </p>
<p>and How do if us want to test it ? ( It will stop automatic unit test&nbsp; ? )</p>
<p>why viewmodel has a responsibilty to display a concrete window ( view ) ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p>
