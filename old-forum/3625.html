<P>IÂ´m&nbsp;new CSLA user and looking into integrating CSLA.NET with a ORM tool...like LINQtoSQL...</P>
<P>Anybody out there who has any experience to pass on&nbsp;in this area?</P>
<P>Cheers </P>

<P>You should also look at the DeepData sample app from <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet">www.lhotka.net/cslanet</A>, as it illustrates some good techniques for working with externalized data access layers. Specifically, when working with an ORM, look at how it uses data transfer objects (DTOs).</P>
<P>That's the thing with an ORM - it will produce "entity objects". That's just a fancy way of saying DTO, and it is important to realize that those entity objects are <EM>not the same as business objects</EM>.</P>
<P>It all comes down to responsibility. The responsibility of an entity object is to provide access to shaped data, backed by a data store. The responsibility of a business object flows from your use case, and the responsibility is <EM>all about business behaviors</EM>.</P>
<P>Entity objects get their responsibility primarily from technology requirements. Only their shape is influenced by business requirements.</P>
<P>Business objects get their responsibility primarily from business requirements. Only their secondary behaviors (like data binding, n-level undo, etc) are influenced by technology requirements.</P>
<P>If you are going to use an ORM - and I expect most of us will once DLINQ and/or ADO.NET EF are options - that's awesome! But these technologies merely replace the use of raw ADO.NET, and they sit naturally behind your actual business layer, which is composed of business objects.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
