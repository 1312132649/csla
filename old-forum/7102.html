Simply build your own rule which calls the RegEx rule.  If the RegEx rule returns false, your rule could change the e.Description to whatever you want, like something from a DecoratedRuleArgs.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, June 16, 2009</h2>I agree with Andy.<br />I do not use the CSLA rules directly. I consider them examples. I have my own Rule class (which started as a copy of the ones Rocky provided but has grown a lot since then.) I can make my own modifications without worrying about changes to the framework.<br /><br />Joe<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
