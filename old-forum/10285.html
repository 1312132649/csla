I am planning out how I will be laying out my objects and basically do not see the need to use ReadOnlyListBase.</p>
<p>In the past, when I create and InfoList class I seem to spend too much time creating the class, criteria and data access. I will be using Entity Framework for the access layer, so that should help a bit. However, I think that for lists, it might be better to use IEnumerable&lt;MyInfoObject&gt;.<br /><br />Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />&nbsp;- Andy</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, April 20, 2011</h2><p>That may work fine, with the following limitations (off the top of my head):</p>
<ul>
<li>You&#39;ll need to make sure your IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; is serializable</li>
<li>If you want to support a Silverlight or WP7 or Android or iOS client, you&#39;ll need to manually implement IMobileObject to make the list serializable (good luck, that&#39;s hard)</li>
<li>You won&#39;t be able to bind to all UI technologies, as they don&#39;t all bind against IEnumerable</li>
<li>Even when binding does work (such as in WPF/SL/WP7), you probably won&#39;t get automatic client-side sorting (though your mileage may vary)</li>
<li>Although the data portal will work against any concrete type, you still need to provide a criteria and implement the DataPortal_Fetch or factory Fetch method - that&#39;s a requirement for any type you retrieve via the data portal</li>
</ul>
<p>My recommendation is that you look at the current CSLA 4 code techniques for using ROLB and ROB (as shown in the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebooks). The amount of code required is quite low - and (assuming you want the features of the data portal and data binding) you&#39;ll almost certainly end up writing at least that much code to roll your own solution.</p>
