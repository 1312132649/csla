<p>&quot;This request operation sent to net.tcp://dt01:8500/LtsHostService did not receive a reply within the configured timeout (00:01:00).&nbsp; The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout.&nbsp; This may be because the service is still processing the operation or because the service was unable to send a reply message.&nbsp; Please consider increasing the operation timeout (by casting the channel/proxy to IContextChannel and setting the OperationTimeout property) and ensure that the service is able to connect to the client.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It occurs when a long running Sql Query fails to complete in 60 seconds, the operationtimeout parameter noted in the error.&nbsp; I have not been able to find a way to configure WCF to lengthen the timeout and unfortunately in this application sometimes more than 60 seconds is required to retreive the data.</p>
<p>Has anyone dealt with this particular error and found a solution?&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>The other possible thing to look at is the timeout on the actual SQL statement itself, trying to debug when using WCF can be really frustrating I&#39;ve found as it doesn&#39;t report the best error messages all the time. Though if this was the case you would expect an error when not using WCF as well.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
