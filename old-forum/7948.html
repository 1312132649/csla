<P>Csla has nice features for RBAC (Role Based Access Control). I mean, when you want to control access to objects or properties (meaning forms and fields).</P>
<P>What about application menus? Did someone wrote a Role Based Menu (RBM)?</P>
<P>What I'm looking for is some way to build menus loading from storage:<BR>- menu item name<BR>- parent menu item name<BR>- AllowRead, DenyRead, AllowExecute, DenyExecute (list of roles)<BR>- friendly name or resource name for the friendly name<BR>- assembly and method to call<BR>- etc</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 04, 2009</h2>CSLA 3.6 and higher have per-type authorization rules. So rules about whether you can create, get, edit or delete a type of object. These rules are set by the business class, but are available to the UI, so they can be used for things like managing menus and similar UI concepts.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
