<p>We have recently moved from CSLA 4.0.3 to CSLA 4.3.14.2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything has been working well until a colleague has mentions that they are no longer able to see what is currently within the deleted list.</p>
<p>On looking at the deleted list it seems to be a &#39;object&#39; however i thought it was treated as a list(of T) so you can see what is current inside the deleted list.</p>
<p>Because of that we are unable to see what is currently in the deleted list AND to remove items from the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trying to do ?me.deletedList in the intermediate window i get the following message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for only just replying. </p>
<p>We are attempted to do a undelete on a object that cannot be deleted for various reasons that only become apparent on the save of a object list. this works perfectly and i can debug it within the object list absolutely fine, however on the guys machine i am unable to debug the deleted list, do i need to set a option in visual studio to allow me to debug it?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>harrybow5 replied on Monday, June 09, 2014</h2><p>This is within the object list instance, we have tried to do &#39;?me.deletedlist&#39; in the intermediate window on the &#39;RemoveItem&#39; sub routine.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
