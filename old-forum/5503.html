<p class=MsoNormal><span>There is one &#8211; that Rocky recommended to me couple of
years back, and it changed my whole view on software design.&nbsp; It is called
&#8220;Object Thinking&#8221; by MS Press &#8211; Dr David West.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>It is not one of those &#8220;Design Pattern&#8221; books that
puts everything in these nice little compartments, and assumes that us
developers do not have to &#8220;think&#8221; but just follow these
pre-established scenarios, and assemble enterprise applications as more of a
Lego puzzle.&nbsp; This is the type of book that gives you perspective on
history of OO, dissects between successful and simple approaches to software
design and gives real-world examples of that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>This is not a C#, VB, or Java specific book.&nbsp; This is a
type of book that makes you question your decisions in each part of software
development process and helps you guide, through experience of others to
better&nbsp; approaches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rocky's is the best book on applied design I have yet
found.&nbsp; If there are others worth looking at then I would love to know as
well.<br>
