Any caveats?<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, November 16, 2009</h2><P>Why would you enable your customers to make this choice? Is there some advantage you or they gain?</P>
<P>CSLA is flexible to shield against technology changes - Remoting and asmx are legacy, WCF is current - and I added the whole provider model as a way to gracefully support movement from the older technologies to WCF, and perhaps someday from WCF to yet another thing.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Monday, November 16, 2009</h2>Well, our customer base ranges from single standalone installations with a very small database (a few hundred items) and single user, to large cross-site deployments with hundreds (or more) of users and hundreds of thousands of items.  Then we have distributed customers who need access via firewalls.<br /><br />For the small customer, the local data portal is the easiest to deploy. <br /><br />As you suggest, we're recommending WCF as the suggested 3-tier configuration. <br /><br />I also have customers with unique IT organizations who sometime dictate policy. One of our customers can't make any configuration changes to their IIS machines. The standard IIS deployment in their network supports the asmx portal, but not the WCF portal.  So, it seemed wise to maintain the flexibility provided by the framework.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, November 16, 2009</h2>Certainly it should be fine to use any of the data provider channels - and<br />your reasons seem sound.<br /><br />You should probably know that in 4.0 my plan is to move the Remoting, asmx<br />and Enterprise Services channels out of the core framework and to put them<br />into a separate project (or projects). They'll still work as they do today,<br />they'll just be in separate assemblies.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Tuesday, November 17, 2009</h2>Thanks. <br /><br />I'm really surprised there aren't more (at least based on the response) that don't use at least 2 portals -- the local portal + at least one of the 3 tier portals.  <br /><br />You espoused at some length in your 2005 book that scaling to 3 tiers actually reduced performance for the individual user, so I'd think that use of the local portal would be common as it would provide the best performance in smaller simple network situations. Having the ability to easily scale upwards should the situation demand it is a major plus and one of the main reasons we initially chose CSLA. </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
