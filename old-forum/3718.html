But when I was doing it, a new doubt raises: <b>"Why the child (or children) objects aren't marked like children (with MarkAsChild())</b> <b>on their constructor or in any other side?"</b>. I'm trying to implement that method in the normal way (ADO.NET directly), not using a DAL or DTO. Is it just for the fact that the children objects and list objects are <b>ReadOnly</b>?<br><br>Maybe someone can explain it to me (I hope).<br><br>Thanks in advance!<br><br>No√©<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Monday, October 15, 2007</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Yes, that would be the reason.&nbsp; MarkAsChild() has implications for saving/editing of objects.&nbsp; Since ReadOnlyBase objects don't do any of that, MarkAsChild() isn't necessary/available.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>If you were loading editable children/grandchildren, you would need to call MarkAsChild().</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>elnoegarcia replied on Tuesday, October 16, 2007</h2>Ok thanks!! that's all I needed to know "tmg4340".<br><br>Have a nice day!<img src="/emoticons/emotion-21.gif" alt="Yes [Y]" /><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
