<P>Also, you may consider buying the <A href="http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;ProductID=16">Business Object Types video</A>, which includes some very focused demos showing how to create most common business object types and also explains how and why the objects are constructed the way they are.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
