As near as a I can tell, everything is configured the same way, but the login.aspx page isn't redirecting to the URL originally requested (which was default.aspx).<br /><br />Even if I add code to the Login control's LoggedIn event, the redirect to default.asxp seems to be getting bounced back to login.aspx.  I can't figure out whats going on.<br /><br />This is IIS 7, Integrated pipeline setup on Vista Business 64 bit.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Andy</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, July 28, 2009</h2>I'm trying to run the PTracker sample to see how it behaves.  I have it working, sort of.  I get an error when viewing pages "ASP.NET Ajax client-side framework failed to load."<br /><br />The common cause seems to be that Asp.Net AJAX isn't installed, but I have VS 2008 SP1 / Framework 3.5 SP1.  Shouldn't they be included by default?<br /><br />EDIT:  Found a (stupid) fix.  Repairing .Net Framework 3.5SP1 in Programs / Features fixes the issue..<br /><br />Now to figure out why PTracker login works and my application doesn't!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, July 28, 2009</h2>Yes, it was something stupid.. never do:<br /><br />[authorization]<br />	[allow roles="Admin"/]<br />	[deny users="*"/]<br />[/authorization]<br /><br />I guess I thought the allow would stop the processing of authorization, but changing the * to ? fixes my problem.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
