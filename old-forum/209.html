<P class=MsoNormal>So my question is with regards to CSLA would this be implemented by creating a Criteria class that includes all of the fields in the BO or is there a better way?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Also, I didn’t see any example of the Criteria class providing an operator for each of its fields.

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=609241023-08062006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>There was an excellent thread in which a general purpose 
search/filter form was contributed by the participants (largely the work of 
JCasa as I recall - haven't seen his postings on the board in a while) that may 
interest you.&nbsp; You can find it in the old forum at this

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=609241023-08062006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>One cautionary item:&nbsp; be careful if you try to create 
that "Criteria" class you mentioned in a generic fashion in your posting.&nbsp; 
There is a Criteria Class in CSLA that will likely cause some ambiguity issues 
for you (and anyone you happen to discuss it with, too!!
