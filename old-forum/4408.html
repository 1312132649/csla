I would like to use the latest and greatest version of CSLA (I am a C# developer).<br><br>Can anyone recommend what I should aquire to completely get to grips with CSLA (books, the framework itself etc.,).<br><br>Also, I would like to acquire a code generation system that is and likely to stay up to date with CSLA releases. If anyone can suggest the best system to do this, I would be obliged! <br><br>I look forward to any advice you can offer.<br><br>Thank you so much! :)<br><br>Best regards.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Monday, February 25, 2008</h2><P>I think others like to dig right into code but I'll tell you what I did before even downloading CSLA is I got the book and read all the way from page 1 to the end of the Windows Forms UI chapter, focusing on trying to understand everything I read. </P>
<P>It's a little trickier as the 2.0 book is lacking many new aspects introduced through 3.5, but I think it would be a great place to start as one has to start somewhere. The updated book, I think initially slotted for Q2 has been pushed back I think one quarter but maybe I've misread. </P>
<P>The book is a great read and it'll give you a footing to start from. </P>

<P>Rocky published 2 eBooks in .pdf format&nbsp;as supplements to the paperback. </P>
<P>1. CSLA 2.1</P>
<P>2. CSLA 3.0</P>
<P>They should also be read to understand the newer features of the framework.</P>
<P>Then you should read the posts in this forum relating to 3.5 Beta to undertsand where Rocky is headed. He plans to write a 3.5 book but it won't be ready for a few months. He has a timetable posted on his blog.</P>
<P>Ricky Supit just posted templates for 3.5. He has been doing a great job keeping them up. I beleive they are C# focused - not sure if he or anyone else makes a VB version. The templates use Codesmith which is a great Code Generating tool.&nbsp; Using templates allows you to build BOs in just seconds without any typos. They also conform to the recommended coding style. It makes life so much easier to use templates than coding BOs by hand.</P>
