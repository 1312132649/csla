										Hello everybody (again)! Sorry for the cross post.<br><br>I'm happy to announce the release of the ErrorTreeView on codeplex.<br><br>This is the first release of the project. The functionalities it currently provides are:<br><br><ul><li>Display a tree structure with the errors that your whole BO structure contains.</li><li>Supports the renaming of objects on the fly.</li><li>Supports all 3 severities of rules with their corresponding icons.</li><li>Recognizes the adding/removing of child, grandchild, etc items to your structure.</li><li>Fires an event (on double click) that you can easily handle to point the user to the correct property / item in a collection.</li></ul><br>I hope you find it useful! You can get it at the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=CSLAcontrib">CodePlex site</a>.<br><br><a href="http://img62.imageshack.us/my.php?image=errortreeviewun3.png">Here's a screenshot</a> for your viewing pleasure...<br><br>Plans for the future include:<br><ul><li>Choose what severities you want to show.</li><li>Change icons or disable them.</li><li>Provide
a way to indicate which item is being edited to the tree, so that the
user will be able to easily find the issues of the item being edited.</li></ul><br>Andr√©s</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
