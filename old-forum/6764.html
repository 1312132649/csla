<P>I tried searching here, but didn't find anything.</P>
<P>So for example I have a simple list called "projects" which is of type ProjectList contining ProjectListItems.</P>
<P>If I put "projects" in the watch window, for Value I get:</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>"Count = {System.TypeLoadException}"</FONT></P>
<P>If I put "projects(0)" in the watch window, I get:</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>{"The generic type 'System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection`1' was used with the wrong number of generic arguments in assembly 'mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.":"System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection`1"}</FONT></P>
<P>Is this a known issue, or am I doing something wrong?<BR></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, April 08, 2009</h2>This is a known issue. I've actually talked to the VS debugger team about this, and they didn't have a satisfactory answer - and certainly not a solution. This issue has existed since 2005 when generics were introduced into .NET.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cmay replied on Wednesday, April 08, 2009</h2>Ok thanks.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
