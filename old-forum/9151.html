<p>In&nbsp;the sample code for the&nbsp;CSLA 3.8 core video series, in the Core380\Data\ObjectFactory\Library\TestObject.cs file, you add a PropertyInfo for the EF EntityKey, which, if I understand correctly, is useful in preventing a round-trip to the DB during updates.</p>
<p>My question is, why do you&nbsp;set that PropertyInfo to type &quot;byte[]&quot;, which forces you to Serialize/Deserialize it, instead of just using System.Data.EntityKey ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 30, 2010</h2><p>If I use the EntityKey type, then all my code needs to reference EF, even client-side libraries and things that shouldn&#39;t have to have such a reference.</p>
<p>That couples my entire app to EF, which is (imo) a bad thing. I want only my DAL to be coupled to EF.</p>
<p>Additionally, it might be that EntityKey isn&#39;t serializable? I don&#39;t know for sure.</p>
<p>I am reasonably certain it won&#39;t serialize to Silverlight, where EF doesn&#39;t exist at all.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s probably the key - most of my work for a long time now has been Silverlight focused - so things that don&#39;t work or exist on Silverlight must be isolated very carefully so they are only used in very controlled parts of the code.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lukky replied on Wednesday, June 30, 2010</h2><p>Makes tons of sense <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p>
