<P>It appears that the 1.53 link for the C# side of the page also has been hijacked, but for VS Live 2008.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the 1.53 downloads for both the VB and C# versions seem to be available on the CSLA.NET for Windows download page (though earlier version are not, of course).</P>
<P>I just fielded a request from yet another individual (trying to use the old forum) who will be maintaining a CSLA 1.x app and I wanted to refer him to those great links that discuss each version's changes so he could always figure out why his version may be different from what's in the book.&nbsp; But until the links mentioned above are fixed,&nbsp;we're just out of luck.</P>
<P>Thanks for giving that some attention.</P>

Unfortunately all that content was imported from cvs, which didn't support tagging like svn, and so there are no version-specific tags to make grabbing specific versions as easy as it is now...<br><br>In any case, here's the link to the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Area.aspx?id=3">CSLA .NET 1.x page</a>, from which all the old links I have should now be available.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
