<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I'm only about a week into CSLA.NET (after lurking about for about six months).&nbsp; Currently, I'm using the DevExpress control suite on the front end, and XPO on the backend.&nbsp; I'm refactoring away from XPO in favor of LLBLGen Pro.&nbsp; My intention is to unify&nbsp;a DevExpress UX and an LLBLGen Pro DAL under CSLA, and then abandon my shell.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>After working with XPO for over a year now, I was surprised just how much modeless forms in the UI influenced the architecture of my shell, <EM>specifically in the presence of XPO</EM>.&nbsp; The notion of "session" is devastating.&nbsp; My forms derive from a base class and support tine passing in of&nbsp;CallbacksArgs in their constructors (CallbackArgs encapsulates SaveAndCloseCallback, ApplyCallback, NavigationRequestCallback, and CancelCallback).&nbsp; The callback pattern specifically supports modeless forms, but it doesn't play well with XPO due to anchoring to a session and the behavior of the cache.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Does CSLA.NET take issue with modelss forms?&nbsp; Are their any peculiarities or ideosyncrasies that I should be aware of?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Thank you.</FONT></P>

<P>However, I do know that data binding can complicate the use of modeless forms. If you have more than one form binding to a single business object, data binding will get very confused. Each form's bindingsource (I'm assuming Windows Forms) will assume it "owns" the object, and the&nbsp;2+ bindingsource objects will fight each other.</P>
<P>This isn't so much a CSLA issue, as a data binding issue, but is certainly something to be aware of.</P>
<P>If you don't share object instances across forms, then this is a non-issue, and I can't see where CSLA would care if your forms are modal or modeless. CSLA doesn't have anything to do with navigation or other UI concerns. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>estaylorco replied on Sunday, November 16, 2008</h2><P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Rocky,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Thank you for your reply.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The UI management portion of my shell manages forms in such a way as to prevent more than one form's accessing the same business object simultaneously.&nbsp; For example, forms are opened with TryShow(...) instead of just Show().&nbsp; If a form is already open onto a business object, TryShow() will simply bring it to the front.&nbsp; (This gets even more interesting when a visual tree in the UI is the springboard for creating or editing business objects).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>In any case, you answered my question.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>By the way, Rocky, I purchased your 2005 C# book, along with your two eBooks not long after, and I must say that you are an excellent writer (and speaker).&nbsp; I learned more about architecture in the first 30 pages or so of your book than I've ever learned elsewhere.&nbsp; No kidding.&nbsp; These books, together with your DNR-TV recordings, have given me deep insight into application development under .NET...and in general.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I think you and Franz Bouma (of LLBLGen Pro fame) are two of the most thoughtful software developers out there.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Thank you for your hard work.</FONT></P>
