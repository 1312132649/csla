I am including IsNew, IsDeleted and IsDirty in each of DTOs.<br /><br />My question is how to include deleted items from the collections in the lists of DTOs? Iterating over the child collection only gives the active items and DeletedList is Protected.<br /><br />Has anyone else run across this? It seems like a DTO built like this would make sense since the DAL would have all of the info that it needs to commit the transaction.<br /><br />I am on CSLA 3.05 because I'm stuck in .NET 2.0.<br /><br />TIA,<br /><br />Dave Erwin<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Dave.Erwin replied on Thursday, June 04, 2009</h2>Never mind. Brain cramp. I was trying to fill the entire DTO from the root object. Changed it to call a method in the collection that fills the DTO list. The collection has access to it's DeletedList.<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
