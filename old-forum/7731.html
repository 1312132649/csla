If a user changes any data, it becomes enabled and when I click "Save" it saves and disables itself.<br /><br />Is there any way of getting feedback from the "save" action so that I can put a message on the screen to inform the user that the data has saved successfully? The same applies for creating a new record, if I don't display the ID field on the screen, the user does not know if the data has saved successfully apart from the "Save" button becoming disabled? If I show the ID field, then I can show the new ID to indicate that the data has saved successfully but this is not ideal.<br /><br />Also for field validation, if a field fails validation, it just highlights with a different colour. There is no indication to the user why the validation has failed. Is there any way to intercept the validation check and display a message to the user? <br /><br />These are usability issues that others users will have come across and I would like to know how you resolved the above issues.<br /><br />I am using CSLA 3.7.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /><br />Mark</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Tuesday, October 06, 2009</h2>Save msg - Several ways to do this <br /><br />1. Read in Book about saved event. U can hook up your handler and show appropriate msg once the even occurs.<br /><br />2. Also chk globalcontext, localcontext etc. depending on your configuration, u can use those to pass values from bo to ui and vice versa..<br /><br />WPF validation<br /><br />complete example is given in book, chk propertystatus controll..<br /><br />programatically u can get validation err msgs with brokenrules collection..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiptop replied on Tuesday, October 06, 2009</h2>Thanks Vinod.<br /><br />I will have another look at the book. <br /><br />I had thought of the localcontext as a work around and using a property to indicate a change  but would have thought there was a way of getting feedback from the "Save" method.<br /><br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
