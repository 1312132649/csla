<p>Razor is just a view engine, so that doesn&#39;t affect the model in any way. The dynamic properties added I believe are at the controller level, so again, nothing to do with Model.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Wednesday, November 10, 2010</h2><p>wow... i always thought i was following technology, that is true for WPF and Silverlight<br />But as i was thinking/hoping Silverlight had a good future i kinda ignored ASP.NET webforms and ASP.NET MVC<br /><br />wow.. in what i&#39;ve missed what web technology has improved, i&#39;m full in love with ASP.NET MVC<br /><br />Using templates for MVC 2 i&#39;ve found a nice blog from Brad Wilson (already over 1 year missed)<br /><a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/aspnet-mvc-2-templates-part-1-introduction.html">http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/aspnet-mvc-2-templates-part-1-introduction.html</a><br /><br />I think our new project isn&#39;t going to dynamicly create views at runtime, instead it&#39;s going to generate the controllers, models&nbsp;and&nbsp;views..<br />Our customers must have good tooling that will generate config and that config is going to be parsed to templates and more...<br /><br />Maybe they can use webmatrix for a finishing touch...</p>
<p>Oh well 15.000 hours should be enough won&#39;t it :)</p>
<p>Anyway..&nbsp;To continue my question... <br />I&#39;m intrested to discuss with other developers who are or who are going to use ASP.NET MVC 3 as frontend using csla business objects as the ObjectModel behind the ViewModel (for extending the ObjectModel with for example frontend commands)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Wednesday, November 10, 2010</h2><p>For who has time to play, yesterday the Releae Candidate shipped<br /><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/11/09/announcing-the-asp-net-mvc-3-release-candidate.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/11/09/announcing-the-asp-net-mvc-3-release-candidate.aspx</a></p>
<p>Rocky, is your strategy supporting ASP.NET MVC 3 ?<br /><br />There is for example an dynamic ViewModel property in the ControllerBase in which an model implimenting IViewModel could be set.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 10, 2010</h2><p>Yes, I&#39;ll be looking at MVC 3 to see if there are things CSLA can do to better support the technology.</p>
<p>It is important to remember though, that CSLA is a <em>business layer</em> technology - it helps you create the Model in MVC, MVVM, etc.</p>
<p>This often means that new revisions of a UI technology have little impact on CSLA itself. Unless they invent a new data binding technology, or a new scheme by which model objects are instantiated, there&#39;s usually not a lot that needs to be done.</p>
<p>MVC 3 is backward compatible with MVC 2, so all the nice functionality in Csla.Web.Mvc should continue to work nicely with MVC 3.</p>
<p>Right now my priorities are around CSLA 4 verison 4.1 (WP7 support) and getting the related ebooks done.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
