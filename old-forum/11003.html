<p>I&#39;m considering using CSLA for an existing large, plugin-based architecture (runs in both Silverlight &amp; WPF).&nbsp; Companies, consultants, and other 3rd parties extend the platform by creating extension assemblies which contain plugin classes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve almost worked through the &quot;using csla 4 - overview&quot; document and written no code yet...</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my concern...&nbsp; since CSLA DataPortal is static, much like the <a target="_blank" title="Highlander" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_%28film%29">Highlander</a>, &quot;there can be only one&quot;.</p>
<p>If I use CSLA for the application&#39;s configuration business objects, the writers of extension assemblies cannot use CSLA for their own purposes connecting to various system-of-record data sources with associated business objects.</p>
<p>CSLA is so cool, I&#39;d probably live with that, but has anyone created a instance-based DataPortal implementation that would accommodate this use case?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, December 23, 2011</h2><p>I am glad you are enjoying the books and framework.</p>
<p>The <em>Data Portal Configuration</em> ebook probably contains the information you are looking for. The data portal uses static methods, but they are the gateway to a client-side proxy object that does the real work. It is very possible to have a proxy that intelligently decides which <em>real proxy</em> to use to talk to the server. That allows you to have different objects interact with different data portal endpoints (including different servers).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cmichaelgraham replied on Friday, December 23, 2011</h2><p>Gotcha - so I still use the static DataPortal and I create a client-side proxy that can figure out (based on the request) to which server-specific proxy the call should be delegated...&nbsp; <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-21.gif" alt="Yes" />&nbsp; Thanks !!&nbsp; :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
