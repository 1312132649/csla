<P>(And I don't mean just the simple insert one record, update one record limited sql that one finds in a typical stored procedure supporting standard data entry operations)</P>
<P>Your c#/vb applications will be far better if you can make full use of the database capabilities.</P>

<P>well what do you want to get from the experience ??</P>
<P>not the newest but you could spend some time with:</P>
<P>smalltalk and lisp<BR>-- they are where many things in .net come from, and much of the OO stuff.</P>
<P>for low level and different there is now a forth for .net -- look at channel9.msdn.com</P>
<P><A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=225641">http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=225641</A>&nbsp;</P>
<P>that would be like learning assemly languge and would get you near coding IL stuff.</P>
<P>T-SQL would be good for making better database stuff.</P>
<P>or just look at the ctp bits from microsoft on LINQ that has the betas of the next VB and C# </P>
<P>they are doing some really great things and need feedback on them.</P>
<P>look at channel 9 and msdn for info on them.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RRorije replied on Friday, August 18, 2006</h2>Well, I have done my complete final assignment on functional languages. And I would suggest you look at Haskell. But I am prejudiced. <br><br>Even with a complete computer science study devoted to Java, I still couldn't get indoctrinated ;) with OO languages, and I do like Haskell for certain fields of coding.<br><br>Also when you would like to understand recursion completely Haskell (or any functional language) is very suited. You will certainly understand recursion when you have programmed in Haskell. When I finished my final assignment I could more easy implement a for loop in a recursive way ;)<br><br>The downside of functional languages, also the issue in my final assignment is that functional languages are not very suited (understatement ;) )&nbsp; for I/O.<br><br><br>So far my two cents.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JZuerlein replied on Friday, August 18, 2006</h2><P>The goal is not really to learn a language I could use in a future&nbsp;job.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really to understand a different approach to solving problems.&nbsp; I feel like I have .Net blinders on, and I want to spend some time looking at ways other languages attempt to solve problems.</P>
<P>On a side note, I've got about 12 SQL servers to manage at work, so I spend quite a bit of time with TSQL, but I never thought to mention it as a language.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; ^ )</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
<P>Jeff</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Friday, August 18, 2006</h2><P>So, when you write code in TSQL, are your algorithms based upon sets or records?</P>
<P>Most people transitioning from procedural languages have a record-based processing mentality.</P>
<P>Set based algorithms are often much simpler and much faster.</P>
<P>Example: </P>
<P>A friend of mine was brought in to tune a new Java application's month-end processing routine.&nbsp; There were concerns it might be slow.&nbsp; He calculated how long it took to process a transaction, then checked the production system to see how many transactions had to be processed each month.&nbsp; Then he did the math - it would take around 25 years of processing time each month to run the month-end process.</P>
<P>Needless to say, that was a tad longer than they could accept. :)</P>
<P>So, the fastest way to try to speed things up was to take the java algorithm running on the application server and transpose it into Oracle PL/SQL (like TSQL, but more features).&nbsp; Same algorithm, just different syntax.&nbsp; Removing network traffic from the algorithm reduced the run time down to 6 months or so.&nbsp; Now, a fifty-fold performance improvement is pretty good, but 6 months is still too long for a month-end process!</P>
<P>So, at that point, he told them the fast and easy way wasn't going to cut it.&nbsp; He would have to understand what the algorithm was intended to do and redesign it to make use of set-based principles.&nbsp; When he finished, it took about 8 hours to run.&nbsp;&nbsp; A different way of thinking&nbsp;made a pretty big difference!&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Friday, August 18, 2006</h2><P>Sorry for jumping in...</P>
<P>David, do you have links to set based vs. record based algorithms? Or somehwere that explains what they are? I'd like to know more about that. Searched, but I guess my googler's broke.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>I'm looking for that same type of growth experience.&nbsp; I'm leaning towards a functional language, or maybe spending some time learning about domain specific languages.</P>
