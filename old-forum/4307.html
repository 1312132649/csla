I don't remember having problems with applicationContext though.<br><br>The main parts of what I have now is ...<br><br>Program.cs opens my login form only, not the main form.<br>The Login button, if successful, just closes the login form.<br>The Cancel button also just closes the login form.<br><br>In the login form FormClosed event, if we logged in then I open the main form, else do nothing.<br><br>That works smoothly. The main form seems to appear at the same time or perhaps slightly before the login form disappears. There is no period of nothingness.<br><br>Cheers<br>Ross<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
