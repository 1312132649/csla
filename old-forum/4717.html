<P>"Do something" generally includes:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Fix the problem (or notify the user there was an unfixable problem)</LI>
<LI>Log the problem</LI>
<LI>Add information about the problem by wrapping the exception with a more detailed exception</LI></OL>
<P>If you can't do one of these things, then don't catch the exception.</P>
<P>ProjectTracker could probably use a little more exception handling than it has at the UI layer. But at the data access and business layers there's really nothing to be done about exceptions, and so there's no reason to catch them.</P>
<P>In the DataPortal_XYZ methods it is critical that you <EM>do not catch exceptions</EM>, or if you do that you throw a new exception. Having an exception flow up from a DP_XZY method is how TransactionScope and EnterpriseServices know to roll back the failed transaction.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SouthSpawn replied on Monday, April 21, 2008</h2><DIV>Thanks guys for your responses.</DIV>
