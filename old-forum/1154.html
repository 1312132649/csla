Welcome aboard!

I think your going to find this is one of the most helpful,constructive and positive message boards! I have been working with CLSA for awhile now and have recieved help from tons of people on this board! INCLUDING ROCKY!  

It always amazes me how much and quickly people offer suggestions I hope that I start to get a solid grasp on these theories soon so I can return the favor :)
