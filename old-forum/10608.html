<p>I&#39;d like to see an example of binding to a BusinessListBase (without BXF) in such a way that a new record is created at the end of the list.&nbsp; I can bind a collection in Silverlight, retrieve items across the dataportal and display them, but I&#39;m not aware of how to have items added via AddNewCore which was a comon practice of mine in Windows Forms.</p>
<p>Do we have to use a &quot;Add&quot; button in Silverlight (I see that in the MVVM video) or is the &quot;AddNewCore&quot; available in Silverlight and if so is there an example code&nbsp;that shows client/server code for the BusinessListBase anywhere?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, August 11, 2011</h2><p>You need an add button or link or something similar. The new XAML-based data binding interfaces don&#39;t define any add-new concept, so there&#39;s nothing built into the datagrid to do that operation.</p>
<p>The ViewModelBase and ViewModel classes have a method to do this, so all you need to do is bind your UI element (button or whatever) to that method - but sadly you do need to do it yourself.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Friday, August 12, 2011</h2><p>Oh, I saw the thread discussing the failing of the datagrid in WPF but I thought Silverlight had avoided that pitfall.&nbsp;&nbsp; It really is a slick feature to have rows added <em>automagically</em> at the end.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for communicating this need to the WPF team, I look forward to them releasing an improved version of the datagrid one day.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve the add button working and I&#39;ll go on and put in a delete button as well.</p>
