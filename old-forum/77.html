RoleList is being populated and I have not edited the project in any way since unzipping it. It behaves this way on every form that contains a Role column.<br><br>Could someone please explain this to me.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BARRY4679 replied on Thursday, May 11, 2006</h2>What are you logged in as?

It makes no difference how I log in, it's just .net wierdness. If I keep clicking on the button it eventually drops down, sometimes on the second click, sometimes on the third, sometimes after a double-click. Not great for a UI but at least I'm not going crazy.

Thanks.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BARRY4679 replied on Thursday, May 11, 2006</h2>In my case it is always the 2nd click, ie. one click to select the field, then a further click to activate the drop down.<br><br>Barry Mossman<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
