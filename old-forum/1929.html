I am trying to set up a workflow with WWF exposed as a web service. I am getting this error when trying to pass the BO from one activity to another (WebServiceInputActivity to WebServiceOutputActivity).</P>
<P>I am guessing this is because the WWF is trying to serialize the BO out as XML but I am not sure. Does anyone here have any experience with WWF using CSLA?</P>
<P>Thanks, Will</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
