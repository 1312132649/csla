<P>In my Editable List I need to fetch data several times.</P>
<P>First time I fetch list of child objects based on some criteria and then when my EditableList is instantiated I need to&nbsp;fetch one more child based on some rules and add it to the previously loaded list. </P>
<P>When I do that by overloading DataPortal_Fetch it returns me EditListObject with only one child in it. All the previously loaded child objects are destroyed.</P>
<P>I need to know what is the appropriate way of doing this.</P>
<P>Thank you,</P>
<P>Igor.</P>

<P>If you know everything up front then you do all the work in the normal DP method call.</P>
<P>1. Load the full list.</P>
<P>2. Add the extra child object to the list.</P>
<P>3. Then return the fully loaded list.</P>
<P>It sounds like you are making 2 calls to the DP. The first call returns the fully loaded list. But the 22nd call destroys the list and returns only the extar child. This is the expected behavior.</P>
<P>If you need the full list but can only add the child later then your list needs a method to add a child.</P>
<P>My ECC lists all have methods like Add. I also include a function AddChild which takes the PK value, creates the child instance, adds it to the list and then returns me a reference to the newly created child. Then I can set the rest of the properties.</P>

<P>Thank you,</P>
