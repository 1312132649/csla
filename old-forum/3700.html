<P>I've just reworked my app as business code had creeped into the UI layer. I've come to a point where I need to move user options from a settings file to the DB.</P>
<P>So I'm thinking about creating a UserOptionsBO which allow user to maintain their options. Then I'll create a UserOptionsInfoBO with readonly properties so I can get the properties as needed.</P>
<P>What do you guys think of this somewhat standard method? How does it compare to the way you handle user options?</P>
<P>Cheers</P>

<P>I've been using .config too, and will continue to for Windows colour and sizes etc. The options I'm talking about are things like "grace period between work slots", "default project", "max number of active projects"&nbsp;etc, so BL properties (as you say properties that change how the app works).&nbsp;Thanks for the reassurance. </P>
