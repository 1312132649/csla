Clone() uses serialization / deserialization to create a copy of an object, so there's no way you can have a direct reference to the original object. Are you inheriting from csla directly or are you using an intermediate class?. The behaviour you're describing sounds strange... Is there any more info you can throw in the mix? or is that the exact code you have? CSLA 1.x or 2.0? (although there shouldn't be any difference).<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dean replied on Monday, May 08, 2006</h2>When you get the new object it is an exact copy of the old - so the key
fields will all be the same - so saving it will indeed update bo1. You
need to have a way to change these key fields. I have to copy an order
object - so I have a copy that will clone it and then create new key
fields - then you can save it - but you need tomake sure child keys are
updated too.<br>
