Details are here:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-small;">
<p>https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/releases/tag/v4.6.001</p>
<p>The primary change (and point of risk) is that I consolidated nearly all the code files into a set of shared projects, adding some compiler directives to address any outstanding conflicts between the old duplicate code files.</p>
<p>The upside of this is that maintenance of CSLA will now be much easier, as will adding support for new platforms or version of .NET over time.</p>
<p>The downside is that I may have introduced bugs if I got some of the compiler directives wrong - especially likely in the Android and iOS code (the areas most affected by the duplicate code).</p>
<p>If you find any issues please add issues to GitHub with details on what you encounter - thanks!</p>
