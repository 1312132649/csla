You could also just call ValidationRules.CheckRules() to run all the rules in your class.<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: xAvailx [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Wednesday, October 21, 2009 7:29 PM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: [CSLA .NET] Validation Rule Groups<br /><br />Is there a way to specify a set of validations to be validated together?<br /><br />The scenario I have is I have about 8 validation rules that need to be triggered based on the state of an object.

I think that would solve my issue.<br /><br />My question is related to this post:<br /><br />http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/37341.aspx<br /><br />Thx.<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, October 22, 2009</h2>Hi, <br><br>I agreee with Sergey that you should look at AddDependentProperty and I 'd prefer to define these as DependentProperties as depedent between properties in your BO. <br><br>However - a DependentProperty can also be what you described as a Group that does not have to be an actual implemented property in the BusinessObject. <br><br>Ex: <br><i>ValidationRules.AddDependentProperty("property1", "group1", true);<br>ValidationRules.AddDependentProperty("property2", "group1", true);<br>ValidationRules.AddDependentProperty("property3", "group1", true);</i>
<br>
<br>And you could then call:<br><i>ValidationRules.CheckRules("group1");</i><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xAvailx replied on Thursday, October 22, 2009</h2>I think this is what I am looking for. See my reply to Sergey regarding further explanation of my scenario. I will give this a shot. Thx!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
