I downloaded release 3.6.0 csla and project tracker. I followed the instructions on the site to the letter. Directory name and all. After all was set up I attempted to run it. I get the main splash page. Click on login, enter PM and PM/pm and pm all combinations. The page displayed has the error <EM>No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it 127.0.0.1:4147</EM> . I am running all on a local box. Dell X64 quad with Windows XP x64. I have added the port inquestion to the local box firewall. I have run out of ideas. Really need help in getting the application working. </P>

<P>If so, then you need to start by troubleshooting the WCF service. You can do this by right-clicking the svc file in the WcfHost project and choosing to view it in the browser. That should result in a WCF test page.</P>
<P>If that works, the next step is to make sure the URL in the test browser window is the same as the one in the app.config of the client app (PTWin or PTWpf or whatever).</P>
<P>Normally the firewall doesn't actually get in the way of these things, because it is localhost talking to localhost. This most common problem is that VS sometimes decides to change the port number of the host, and that's not real obvious unless you check the web project properties or view the svc file in the browser.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>carney replied on Tuesday, July 14, 2009</h2>I actually have never followed the instructions to set all this up, and I have also never run PTWeb. So I did what you did and set everything up according to the instructions. Wow was it a lot easier! I too, got the error you described. It is because step 5 was a little vague. It says, "You should now be able to run the various UI projects." What is inferred here is that you have to run the solution. If you open the project tracker solution and run it, the various Casini instances will spin up. Among these is <A href="http://localhost:4147">http://localhost:4147</A> which hosts WcfPortal.svc. Now if you go to <A href="http://localhost/PTWeb">http://localhost/PTWeb</A>, click Login, enter your credentials and click Log In, <A href="http://localhost:4147/WcfHost/WcfPortal.svc">http://localhost:4147/WcfHost/WcfPortal.svc</A> will be up and running and should service your request.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
