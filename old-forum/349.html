cart.&nbsp; I'm sure both of them will work, but I wanted some quick
opinions on which of the two is correct in an object oriented context.<br>
<br>
ShoppingCart<br>
+ShoppingCartItems: BusinessListBase<br>
++ShoppingCartItem: BusinessBase<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
ShoppingCart: BusinessListBase<br>
+ShoppingCartItem: BusinessBase<br>
<br>
so... The ShoppingCart object IS A collection of ShoppingCartItems - or
- The ShoppingCart HAS A collection of ShoppingCartItems.<br>
<br>
I would also want to support things like a property for the created
time of the shopping cart, the username of the owner of the shopping
cart etc, but I think this should be able to be implemented in either
scenario.&nbsp; Correct?<br>

<P>Unless of course, you need or want to be stateless (like in an ASP.NET UI), in which case neither is correct and you must have all editable root objects <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, June 13, 2006</h2><P>Everything must be editable root objects in ASP.Net? </P>
<P>Isn't that letting the UI dictate the object model? I'm actually having a pretty good go of it with business objects containing collections and so forth. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Edit: Sorry, I didn't read your post thoroughly enough where you explicitly said "stateless" interaction on ASP.Net. I guess maintaining an "active object" between postbacks isn't stateless! </P>
