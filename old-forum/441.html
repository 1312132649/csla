I've just looked at briefing about db4o and I want to hear experiences of people that used it. OODB is something that could solve a lot of business application problems. I'll try it ASAP.<br><br>Thanks for the info.<br><br>Bu®majaM<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Thursday, June 22, 2006</h2>Just so that you have some background on this, here are a couple of links from previous discussions in the old forum:<br><a href="http://groups.msn.com/cslanet/general.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=18099">Post 1</a><br><a href="http://groups.msn.com/cslanet/general.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=22810">Post 2</a><br><br><br>Andrés<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Thursday, June 22, 2006</h2><P>Yes, this was discussed extensively before.&nbsp; Two main points...</P>
<P>1 - The product is not free after all for commercial purposes</P>
<P>2 - At that time there was not robust enough mechanism for concurrency (in my opinion and agreed to by the support folks there).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Thursday, June 22, 2006</h2>




<DIV><SPAN class=968222114-22062006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>The 
db4o website looks pretty interesting so I tried opening your tgz file with 
WinZip.&nbsp; It diagnosed the contents as a .tar file but was "unable to 
inflate" it.&nbsp; Is there a different tool we should use to open your file or 
might it be corrupted?</FONT></SPAN></DIV></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
