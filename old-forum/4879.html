Then have the Execute() method return that object. Is that the way it's supposed to be done? Is there a better way? I have read on these forums that one of the reasons for using a Command object is so that you can get some info back. So I assume there is a generally accepted way of doing that. I'm sure I could get it working with my return object but I want to make sure I'm following "best practices" as much as possible.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
