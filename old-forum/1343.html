<P>Yeah ! <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />&nbsp; I just saw the blog with the "good" versions <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
<P>I think when you edited you just made an error... </P>
<P>Hmmm let me see....</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>figuerres replied on Wednesday, September 27, 2006</h2><P>Rocky: check you email <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
<P>1 Gif version</P>
<P>1 Jpg version</P>
<P>gif beeing limited to 256 colors can be a pia, when it cuts the pallete down you have to pic what colors to keep and how to pic them.&nbsp; "Optimised Octree" and "match color" will generally work best for this kind of thing. </P>
<P>I'm no great artist but I know just enough to hack a few things up <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
