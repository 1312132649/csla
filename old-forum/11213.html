<p>1.) Will we see a Using CSLA 4 with WinRT?</p>
<p>2.) Can you comment on new &quot;greenfield&quot; development using CSLA, WinRT, Silverlight....?</p>
<p>There seems to be&nbsp;opportunity for reduce the &quot;bleed edge&quot; risk by developing a flexible business logic base like CSLA.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 07, 2012</h2><p>I think it is very likely that there&#39;ll be a <em>Using CSLA 4.5:&nbsp;WinRT</em> book in the future, yes. Probably not until Win8 actually ships so things are stable, but yes.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure what you mean with &quot;greenfield&quot; in this context? You mean writing a new app that is designed from the start to work on both Desktop and WinRT (and thus also Win7)?</p>
<p>Once I have a WinRT (WRT) version of CSLA 4 working (more than it is now - I haven&#39;t tested the remote data portal yet anyway), we&#39;ll instantly be in a position where existing CSLA 4 business classes that are running on Silverlight (or WP7) will &quot;just work&quot; when recompiled for WRT.</p>
<p>And because those apps are almost certainly 3- or 4-tier apps, where the data layers are running on a server, none of that code will change either.</p>
<p>So thinking about the CSLA architectural model, the only layers impacted by WRT are the Interface and Interface Control layers. I rather suspect that some of the MVVM UI frameworks will solve the Interface Control layer mismatch, allowing you to use some or all of your viewmodel code between SL and WRT. That would mean only the actual XAML composing the Interface layer (view) will need to be changed.</p>
<p>From what I&#39;m seeing so far in the beta, if you stick with standard XAML controls and do styling (as opposed to using lots of third party controls or things like a datagrid), your XAML will probably move from SL to WRT with very little effort. So porting the view may not be a big deal either.</p>
<p>This is especially true if this is a greenfield effort, so you can be careful about your XAML to minimize the differences. Probably including concepts like making your SL views follow the basic layout of a WRT view, and using the same navigation structure.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Wednesday, March 07, 2012</h2><p>Rocky,</p>
<p>Quick question (a little off topic here), do you know if Microsoft is planning to force all application (including&nbsp;business application) to be deployed from their app store?</p>
<p>I mean, assuming that the whole Windows 8 / WinRT is an awesome environment to work on and everyone loves it, I am not sure if business would be OK with the idea of being forced to go&nbsp;through&nbsp;the Microsoft App Store. Such limitation seems&nbsp;like&nbsp;a deal killer to me.</p>
<p>But maybe is not true that you have to go&nbsp;through&nbsp;the app store, I think I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;reading about it but perhaps it was just a&nbsp;rumor and I am wrong. I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;that is the way things are handled on Windows Phone but&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;I am wrong there too.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is a silly question, I have not kept up to date with a lot of the new Microsoft stuff!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, March 07, 2012</h2><p>Microsoft is apparently planning to support private app store.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to your book. I am sure I will learn as much about WinRT as I will about CSLA from reading it.</p>
