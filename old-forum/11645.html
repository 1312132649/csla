<p>Anyone have a working sample of this along with teh XAML.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m using MVVM so maybe that&#39;s an issue ore perhaps the use of&nbsp; static resource/collection view source is the issue?&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Thursday, October 18, 2012</h2><p>Page 130 of CSLA 4 Data Access</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure with MVVM if I have to manually call SaveItem - it appears, according to the text that SaveItem should automatically be triggered by navigation off a row.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I have to handle this by handling a row changed event and triggering this myself?&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t seem like that should be necessary.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Thursday, October 18, 2012</h2><p>Found the answer here <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/10357/48504.aspx#48504">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/10357/48504.aspx#48504</a></p>
<p>What a bizarre little bug.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
