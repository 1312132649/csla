<P>This particular BO is 99.99% the same as another one that retrieves data without a hitch; the only difference is the name of one of the parameters I'm passing into my sproc.</P>
<P>What on earth could possibly be causing this?&nbsp; </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Tuesday, December 05, 2006</h2><P>Have you seen what you're actually sending to the db via the profiler? I usually capture the profiler output, then run that through a query in management studio.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>albruan replied on Tuesday, December 05, 2006</h2>I did as you suggested and it shows the two values I'm attempting to pass to my sproc.&nbsp; The profiler also shows that 2 reads were made when the statement was executed.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>albruan replied on Tuesday, December 05, 2006</h2>Hmmmm, when I copy the statement from the Profiler and attempt to run it in SQL Server Management Studio, it returns nothing.&nbsp; OH!&nbsp; NM!&nbsp; Dyslexic typing on my part when assigning the values passed into the Criteria object....hahahaha!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Tuesday, December 05, 2006</h2><P>You beat me to the post. Glad you figured it out.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Tuesday, December 05, 2006</h2>How about when you copy what the profiler says, then paste that into a new query in management studio and run it?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
