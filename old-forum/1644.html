<P>In a nutshell, we are looking for a grid control that emulates the type of dynamic editors you can find in win apps.&nbsp; More specifically, we need to be able to do inline editing (which I was able to accomplish using the proper template design in the aforementioned controls), with "immediate" deletion and addition of new rows.&nbsp; These seem to be the two sticky points.</P>
<P>The best example I can give is working with a resource file in Visual Studio.&nbsp; To delete a line, simply select the line and hit the delete key or click the toolbar button.&nbsp; To add a line, simple start typing in the empty row at the bottom of the list.&nbsp; When you do so, another new line is added to the list.</P>
<P>Our goal is to NOT have to use "edit", "delete" and "add" links or buttons to accomplish the task.&nbsp; The users of this application have thrown a fit over this as, in their words, " it reminds them that they aren't using Office."&nbsp; (Gotta love customers!)&nbsp; Anyway, since I have yet to find myself inventing anything new, I hardly believe that is the case here as well.&nbsp; So, I am hoping that given the breadth of knowledge in this forum, someone has come across a better grid and can direct me where to look.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P>

<DIV>Try that one.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Telerik supposedly has a good one also.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, October 31, 2006</h2>Well, the main problem is that the web was never intended for this kind of rich application interface.&nbsp; It reminds the users they aren't using office because they aren't; they're using a web browser.&nbsp; If your interface must provide a 'rich' experience, you're better off doing a winforms app with click once deployment.<br><br>That said, I realize its probably not an option for you.&nbsp; You can do what you want, but its going to be lots of DHTML and Javascript.&nbsp; And its not going to work quite right across different browsers... which is probably why you're having a hard time finding a prebuilt component (although there may be some out there..).&nbsp; We did this before targeting only IE as the browser... and it was messy and tough.<br><br>Good luck.<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pelinville replied on Tuesday, October 31, 2006</h2><DIV>I use the devexpress one.&nbsp; It does just about every thing you can think and I know it works with Mac Safari at least.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Words of warning.&nbsp; It uses alot of client side script so it can be very slow, especially on older machines.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I found the control to have&nbsp;a bit of a learning curve as well.&nbsp; Devexpress support can be horrible.&nbsp; Sometimes I get the help I need other times it seems I get nothing but canned responses and they don't even read my question.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>But it does act alot like a spread sheet does.&nbsp;</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pandelaras replied on Tuesday, October 30, 2007</h2><P>I dont have a specific answer, but i know where to search for an answer.

<P>Their controls are all AJAX enabled and their technical support is excellent.&nbsp; There are plenty of good working examples on their website as well.</P>
<P>As to whether you can get exactly the behaviour you are describing, I'm not 100% sure.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
