The property accepts a enum value, so it can be one of 6 values. When this 'condition' is met, the property should be deactivated - meaning that you cannot change it.<br /><br />I know that the Auth rules contains the CanWriteProperty - but this is more of a business validation issues than a authorization issue.<br /><br />Should I just raise an exception whenever the property is changed? How would I go to work on this?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Monday, July 20, 2009</h2><font face="Arial" size="2">The other thing to consider is overriding CanWriteProperty() method and then putting into that method for the specific property. You can then use the ReadWriteAuthorization control to enable/disable your controls and the standard write exceptions would be thrown if a developer did try to set it manually.</font><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
