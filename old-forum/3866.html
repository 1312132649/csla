From what I have researched it can, but just wanted to ask the question just in case I was missing something. </P>

<P class=MsoNormal>Thanks </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, November 08, 2007</h2><P>In my opinion, one of the most effective uses of&nbsp;CSLA and one of its best qualities, with mobile business objects, is the creation of effective smart clients.</P>
<P>The answer is yes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Friday, November 09, 2007</h2><P>Agreed, the answer is definitely yes.</P>
<P>And the added potential benefit is that CSLA is designed specifically to be UI neutral.</P>
<P>So if you are then asked to provide a Web UI or a Web Service API for the same underlying application, then you should be able to do it by just writing a new UI.&nbsp; You won't have to rewrite your entire Business Object layer to support the new UI.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
