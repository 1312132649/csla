here's a good article I found on the board. <br>

Our business requirments do not require that a user be checked if they can Add/Edit a single field of the <br>object. We only really need to say something like this.<br><br>

Does this user have rights to Add/Edit This customers Contact information?  <br><br>

What is the feelings about not using the AddAuthorizationRules methods and just using the <br><br>CanAddObject,CanEditObject etc methods? <br><br>

We have "Rights" for specific areas in our application like AddEditContactInfo, AddEditBillingAddress. <br>
These rights would be confirmed in CanAdd,CanEdit methods before allowing the user to do anything with the <br>object.<br><br>

Basically, we can apply a permission to an entire object not a single property. So I'm thinking I can avoid the <br>overhead of Authorization Rules and just call the previously metioned methods. <br>
<br><br>
What ya think?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 12, 2006</h2><P>You absolutely can do that - this is one primary reason for CanReadProperty() and CanWriteProperty() being virtual/Overridable.</P>
<P>Just remember that those methods get invoked <EM>a lot</EM> and so the code you write behind them needs to be quite efficient, and can't be going off and hitting expensive resources like a database or something on every call.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RangerGuy replied on Tuesday, September 12, 2006</h2>Thanks Rocky!

I'm doing something like this CanAddEditContactInfo() which contains a simple loop thru a static list of permission that won't be crazy large and returns true if it finds the permission in the users role.
