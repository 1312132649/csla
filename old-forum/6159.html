On textchange I fire this method again to refresh the UI.<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: Brad [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Wednesday, January 14, 2009 9:01 PM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: [CSLA .NET] Filtering a WPF ListBox<br /><br />Greetings,<br /><br />I am using a CslaDataProvider to get back a read only list of business objects.

All that extra functionality that the ObjectDataProvider adds isn't available in the CslaDataProvider.<br /><br />Anyway u can dynamically filter using the CslaDataProvider FactoryParameters which will result into a new query being executed. Just databind the FactoryParameters to the control :)<br /><br />PS: See page 611 in the 3.6 CSLA book for an example.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
