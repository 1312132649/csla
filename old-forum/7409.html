And some of the lists are lazy loaded. <br><br>You should focus on the UseCase and what data is required for that specific case. Sometimes you may need a large object graph but my aim is always to keep the object graph as small as possible (and more maintainable). <br><br>/jonnybee<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
