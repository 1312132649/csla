When I call delete on the child object I get the error "<SPAN id=ctl00_ContentPlaceHolderMain_OutcomeFormTable1_lblMessage1>Can not directly mark a child object for deletion - use its parent collection". <FONT color=#000000>My problem is that this child object is not in a collection since there is only one.

But your parent object can cast the child as IEditableBusinessObject and call the DeleteChild() method on that interface.</P>
<P>You'd probably do this in some RemoveChild() method in the parent. So if the parent is a Product object that has a PrimaryVendor property (child object), you might do this in Product:</P>
<P>public void RemovePrimaryVendor()<BR>{<BR>&nbsp; var vendor = ReadProperty(PrimaryVendorProperty);<BR>&nbsp; if (vendor != null)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((IEditableBusinessObject)vendor).DeleteChild();<BR>}</P>

I am using 3.7 and I have the same scenario a child object that is not in a collection, but I cannot for the life of me get the object to delete.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
