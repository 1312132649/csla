I don't want to use the current version of things because I'd like to use WPF and I'd rather use a version of CSLA that takes full advantage of WPF binding.<br /><br />Can we get a rough guesstimate of when CSLA 4.0 will be available?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, August 11, 2009</h2><P>I don't have an estimate. My primary focus right now is on Silverlight 3 and putting together a video series on CSLA .NET for Windows.</P>
<P>Given that, I don't expect to <EM>start</EM> working on 4.0 in any serious way until maybe November.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
