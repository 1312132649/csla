This input parameter is used to set some of the properties of the new object. <br><br>Right now in this same method I'm validating that the input object is in an appropriate status before using it. If it is not, I throw an ArgumentException. The issue I have with this is that receiving an invalid object is very common, so it's not really an "exceptional" case. The other alternative I had was to create a business rule that would apply only when the business object is new, but in that case I would need to create a class variable to hold the input object, which right now I don't need to.<br><br>Other approach I consider is to leave it as it is, but implement a method that would allow the UI to test the validity of the input argument before trying to create the new object; Pretty much a Tester-Doer pattern.<br><br>I'd like to know what others are doing in this case. Any suggestions?<br><br>- Miguel<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Fintanv replied on Friday, August 29, 2008</h2>I have used a similar approach to the Tester-Doer pattern you describe.&nbsp; I think it works well since you more than likely will want to provide some sort of UI communication to the user indicating the issue.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
