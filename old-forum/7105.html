What I generally do is find somewhere else in my call stack to set the breakpoint and magically that seems to fix things.<br /><br />I'm sure it's a VS bug though.<br /><br />Sorry I can't be much help.<br /><br />Craig</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Peran replied on Monday, June 22, 2009</h2>I could not get your fix to work, but I did find a different work around; by detaching &amp; re-attaching the debugger (Debug-&gt;Detach All; Debug-&gt;Attach To Process...) the issue did not occur for the remainder of that debug session.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
