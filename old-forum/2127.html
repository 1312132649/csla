<P>If they are being maintaned I have in issue with timestamp properties being created with incorrect size.&nbsp; I've looked through the templates and haven't been unable to correct it my self.</P>
<P>Either way I appreciate the effort put into the templates.&nbsp; Thank you to all involved in there development.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
