<P>What I didn't find is how to properly handle non-serializeable Exception?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, August 25, 2008</h2>Well, I would say your best bet right now is to use your BusinessBase subclass (and the six other subclasses of core Csla objects) and override OnDataPortalException.&nbsp; You can then throw an Exception and try to keep the message and other details, but you'll lose the stack trace unfortunately.&nbsp; <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
