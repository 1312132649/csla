<P>I have a hefty library developed with 2.1. I need it to work with partial trust shared hosting.&nbsp; I also need to ensure it works with our hosting provider by creating a sample app and trying it out - by tomorrow!</P>
<P>I have VS 2008 coming today, so will need to knock up the sample asap.</P>
<P>So... I want to ensure I'm doing the right thing, so could someone confirm my assumptions...!?</P>
<P>1) CSLA Light is required for partial trust (I'm assuming CSLA 3.6 isn't an option).</P>
<P>2) CSLA Light will work without Silverlight, just&nbsp;standard ASP.NET?</P>
<P>If the above is true then what will be involved in converting the 2.1 library to CSLA Light?&nbsp; I'm assuming it's mainly just the data portal code that will need to be changed?</P>
<P>Many thanks.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
