<P>Find the .mdf file.&nbsp; Right click it and select properties.&nbsp; Uncheck the "Read-Only" checkbox and click Apply or OK.</P>

<P>Thanks for your information.</P>
<P>My databases the files are not&nbsp;marked "read only".&nbsp; It is running on XP with VS 2008.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeanB replied on Monday, October 08, 2007</h2>Also you may check the properties for the file and see what users can modify it.&nbsp; I have had issues with projects on my desktop (in a folder) not allowing certain functions.&nbsp; Just right click the file, select properties, select security.&nbsp; I would add everyone with read, modify, and write.&nbsp; That will tell you that you are in the write ballpark if it works.&nbsp; Not the most secure way, but it will illuminate your problem if that is what it is.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
