But I'm getting complie time error.</P>
<P>If I define the method as generic type and pass in the type of BO and the object then it is working fine.</P>
<P>Can anybody guide me on how to solve this issue.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RobKraft replied on Monday, March 31, 2008</h2><P>What error do you receive?</P>
<P>If you are casting the class to an object; then you can only call the methods that are available to any "object", unless you in turn cast the object to something else.</P>
<P>If you are casting the object to an interface, you can call any methods defined for that interface.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Tuesday, April 01, 2008</h2><P>I'm getting a compile time error that cannot convert from my BO to ref object.</P>
<P>This is actually a generic Save Handler. My existing method signature defines it in this way :-</P><FONT size=2>
<P>SaveRecord&lt;T&gt;(</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>ref</FONT><FONT size=2> T Bo) : <FONT color=#0000ff size=2>where</FONT><FONT size=2> T : Csla.Core.</FONT><FONT color=#2b91af size=2>ISavable</FONT><FONT size=2>, System.</FONT><FONT color=#2b91af size=2>ICloneable</FONT><FONT size=2> </P></FONT></FONT>
<P>The problem in this case is that I have to pass in the Bo type also. I have a base class where I want to accept all Business Objects as type of Object and which will perform this save operation automatically.</P>
<P>If passing as object type is sucessfull then I can simply cast to <FONT size=2>Csla.Core.<FONT color=#2b91af>ISavable</FONT>, System.<FONT color=#2b91af>ICloneable</FONT> and perform Clone and Save Operations.</FONT></P>
