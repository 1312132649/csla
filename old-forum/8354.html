I have been developing software in Windows for the past 19 years (mostly using Visual FoxPro!) and have spent a few weeks studying the CSLA.NET framework and Expert C# 2008 Business Objects book and need to get up and running quickly.<br /><br />I would like someone who would be able to help me remotely (using TeamViewer/Skype preferably).  I am based in Trinidad (my time zone is GMT -4) and would need someone who would be available for one or two hours a day, a couple times a week between my hours of 8am to 4pm.  We can set a scheduled time for "discussions" if preferred.<br /><br />Please respond to frank at SamaanSystems dot com with your hourly rate and experience.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
