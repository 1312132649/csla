<P>Compression algorithms are, by definition, consistent. The algorithms used for zip are standard and interchangeable - so I'd expect to get the same compression from any 'deflate' algorithm, for example, because they are mathematically the same. I suppose you could get different performance from different implementations based on how well the algorithm was implemented.</P>
<P>However, if Xceed supports other compression algorithms beyond the standard zip algorithms then you could get different results.</P>
<P>Different types of data compresses more or less effectively with different types of compression algorithm. The zip algorithms are a pretty good set overall, but I imagine you might find that some other algorithms work better or worse (on average) against the XML data generated by the data portal.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
