We use Csla and Cslalight for about 8-9 months now and we're really satisfied with the results.  Two thumbs up!<br /><br />About my request...  cslalight doesn't have all the resource files linked so if we want to have localized validation messages in our SL app, we need to link them and build every time there's a new version.  Otherwise, we end up having localized message on server-side and english messages on client-side...<br /><br />Thanks in advance!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, January 29, 2010</h2><P>That is a good point.</P>
<P>I didn't link them because it doesn't appear that you can link resource files - they don't build correctly.</P>
<P>But it is probably worth copying them, because it would be better to get the localization, even if there's an increased maintenance burden.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>edore replied on Wednesday, April 07, 2010</h2><p>Hi!</p>
<p>Lost track of this post and forgot to answer back...&nbsp; Sorry!</p>
<p>You can link the resource file but wou must change the resx file properties in the SL project.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t keep the &quot;Embedded resource&quot; build action, but rather changes for Compile.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, April 07, 2010</h2><p>That&#39;s a good bit of information, thank you!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
