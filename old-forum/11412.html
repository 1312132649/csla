<p>Here are the 3 errors. Note (I&#39;m running Win8 Release Preview with VS 2012 Ultimate RC)</p>
<p>&#39;Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView&#39; does not contain a definition for &#39;GetForCurrentView&#39;<br />&#39;ApplicationViewStateChangedEventArgs&#39; could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)&nbsp;<br />&#39;Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView&#39; does not contain a definition for &#39;GetForCurrentView&#39;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, June 13, 2012</h2><p>That&#39;s because Microsoft decided to make some braking changes in WinRT from Consumer Preview to Release Preview. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 13, 2012</h2><p>This is correct, there are breaking changes.</p>
<p>Additionally, I wanted to get a working 4.5 build out for people to use, and didn&#39;t want to wait until we&#39;d had time to go through all the samples, so the samples are generally untested at this point.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Friday, June 15, 2012</h2><p>Ok.&nbsp; Sounds good.&nbsp; I&#39;ll just wait for a later release when I can see some samples.&nbsp; It would be cool to see a blog post or something that a little demo of simple WinRT CSLA app with working business rules.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
