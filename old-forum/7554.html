<P>Though the sad fact is that, due to some server shifting a few months ago, my build server is dead and I haven't had a few days to recreate it. Creating and configuring a build server is a major undertaking as it turns out - and it doesn't remotely qualify as fun work (at least for me), so it keeps sliding as I have infinitely more enjoyable (or pressing) matters to deal with.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
