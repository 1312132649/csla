Unkown attirbute RelativeTargetName on element PropertyStatus</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>gwilliams1 replied on Sunday, November 15, 2009</h2>okay, just because i cant give up... i downloaded the 3.7.1 bits of CSLALight and that seemed to do the trick.<br /><br />Now the pressing question. What version of the CSLAlight framework should be using to develop our cutting edge silverlight 3 applicaitons :-)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, November 15, 2009</h2><P>3.6 was build for Silverlight 2.</P>
<P>3.7 is basically 3.6 tweaked to work with Silverlight 3, but doesn't really use SL3 features.</P>
<P>3.8 is build for Silverlight 3 and leverages SL3 features.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, November 15, 2009</h2>Well 3.8 has some breaking changes (quite a number actually) in the Csla.wpf<br />and Csla.Silverlight namespaces.<br /><br />On the Silverlight side this is because the controls were changed to take<br />advantage of the many new binding features in SL3.<br /><br />On the Wpf side this is largely for the same reason - to maintain parity<br />between WPF and SL XAML.<br /><br />And of course 3.8 includes all the new MVVM support, which is pretty darn<br />cool.<br /><br />Read the 3.8 change log to see what is different, and to get a sense for the<br />various breaking changes (they are highlighted in the log).<br /><br />Rocky<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: gwilliams1 [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Sunday, November 15, 2009 2:32 PM<br />To: rocky@lhotka.net<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] CSLA Silverlight 3 and Video Demos error on<br /><br />Sorry I ment to say 3.8.1 version.. the current one on the site<br /><br />i downloaded the 3.6.2 to try that. that was before i saw the updated<br />samples.<br /><br />i will try to re download the 3.8.1 and reset everything. though i thought i<br />had alread done that.<br /><br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
