<p>No, we only have one normal DP call, the rest are ChildFetch, ChildCreate, etc.&nbsp; This is with 4.5.501 on .net 4.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Sunday, May 04, 2014</h2><p>Hi Andy,</p>

<p>&nbsp;thanks, but this isn&#39;t what my question is about.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Monday, May 05, 2014</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have the same issue here. What we ended up doing was to basically trap the exception on the root object, drill down through the exception until we find the exception we are looking for, extract the exception and do a clean re-throw it from the root object. Not a neat solution but it at least it allows us to have consistent exception throwing coming from the business object.</p>
<p>This is not an answer to your question but I though I would post anyway as someone that is experiencing the same issue.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, May 05, 2014</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>Rene Elizondo<br></b>We have the same issue here.

<p>Hey Rene, thanks for posting.&nbsp; that is the workaround we have too, but I&#39;m hoping its a bug that gets fixed, and I&#39;m inferring from Johnny&#39;s response it is.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Tuesday, May 13, 2014</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, anybody has an answer for this? is this a bug or by design behavior?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, May 14, 2014</h2><p>I&#39;d argue its a bug since each inner DPE adds no value :-)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
