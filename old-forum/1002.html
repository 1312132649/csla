Before we create a website and add two virtual directories for ApplicationPortal and DataPortal and we don't have any problems about that. But right now, i am confused how its gonna work with CSLA 2.0, where i'm gonna put my Excutable File and my Business Objects. I'm will use <b>NetRun </b>not ClickOne to launch my application because i have to deploy my business application in different server locations with different configuration settings. For example: if you are in Japan then you can download your business application in japan server using NetRun. We don't used centralization of deployments just because it might be slower if you are in New Zealand and download the business application in japan.<br><br><br>Thanks,<br>Marlon<br></font></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, August 24, 2006</h2>I think you can still use ClickOnce in your setting - it is possible to have multiple ClickOnce servers like you describe. Brian Noyes is in the process of finalizing a book on ClickOnce that has information on how to do this. I know that a "coming soon" book doesn't help today - but the point is I know you can do it, and the answers are out there...<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
