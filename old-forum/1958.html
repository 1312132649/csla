I had completely forgotten about this, but apparently the fix didn't make it into CSLA 2.1.1</P>
<P>The issue can be found&nbsp;on this thread&nbsp;<A HREF="/forums/thread/4859.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/4859.aspx</A>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It has to do with binding either a filteredList or a sortedList.&nbsp; The readWriteAuthorization Control gets lost using either of these.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
