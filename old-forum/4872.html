That context class is defined in the DalLinq project, and was created by Visual Studio.</P>
<P>In the Library project you'll see the DataPortal_XYZ methods. They are required by CSLA and are the points at which your business object must create/fetch/update its data using the DAL. Notice that this is the point at which the data context is used.</P>
<P>Csla.Data.ContextManager is a CSLA .NET type that helps you manage the database connection contained within the data context. When using TransactionScope you must make sure to open and reuse <EM>one single database connection</EM> and ContextManager makes this relatively easy when using L2S.</P>
<P>There's also Csla.Data.ConnectionManager that does the same thing for any raw database connection object (like a SqlConnection).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
