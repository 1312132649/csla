When I write code in the child, I can access the List parent object, but not the root object (Parent of the Parent).  I think most of that logic should live in the base Parent anyway, but I was just throwing that out there.<br /><br />I have a OnChildChanged override that just calls the base.OnChildChanged so that I can check to see if changed events are being propogated on the children and they are!  The problem I am running into is that when I set a rule on the root object and try to access the Child property in the list, the rule never fires.  If I put the child property name in directly I get a compiler warning that the Property is not available in this context (which is correct because it lives on the child which is encapsulated).  A co-worker suggested I put the property name in quotes and it should work.  Still no firing of the rule.  Any suggestions?  Any thoughts of something I may be missing?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2><P>This has been discussed many times. I think you are hooking the "wrong" event. Maybe it is ListChangedEvent that you want. Try searching this forum for these key words and you should probably find a post that answers your question more completely.</P>
