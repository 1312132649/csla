<p>I downloaded the sample code from Apress and loaded it into the directories recommended in the readme file that came with it.</p>
<p>I opened the csla solution file and it converted and built without any problems.</p>
<p>I opened the ProjectTracker solution file and it converted with warnings about it being targeted to .Net 2.0 and not to make any references to newer .Net frameworks.&nbsp; It also suggested changing the target .Net framework if necessary (though I can&#39;t find where to do that in the project&#39;s properties).</p>
<p>When I went then to build ProjectTracker, it failed with errors about missing files or assemblies for &quot;PresentationCFFRasterizer&quot; in the web.config file.&nbsp; I don&#39;t see that name anywhere in the web.config file itself.</p>
<p>I am just getting started with all of this (.Net, VS2010, CSLA, etc.) and any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Or if you do, then you&#39;ll have to deal with the various .NET incompatibilities that have been discussed in various threads recently - CSLA 3.8 doesn&#39;t &quot;just work&quot; in .NET 4 without some minor tweaks.</p>
<p>But if you keep the .NET versions at their previous levels I suspect you should have a relatively easy time of it.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pintoj replied on Friday, May 14, 2010</h2><p>I finally got ProjectTracker working in VS2010!&nbsp; Here is what I had to do:</p>
<p>I went into each web.config file that listed the PresentationCFFRasterizer assembly and just commented it out.</p>
<p>I also changed the dataPortal config to be local (I don&#39;t have Cassini running/configured) for PTWin.</p>
<p>Now I can run it from VS2010. Yeah!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
