<p>wouldn&#39;t you want to bypass all the authorization checks and everything when performing the actual crud actions since all the property setters and getters already perform validation/authorization/business rule checking before it gets to the point of actually writing data to the database?</p>
<p>just wondering if there is any significant difference here that i am missing before i start writing anything</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any help is appreciated, thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 09, 2010</h2><p>The property persistence code is in a &quot;using (BypassPropertyChecks)&quot; block, and so rules are suppressed for all the code. However, the SmartDate property is actually a <em>string</em> property, with a SmartDate backing field. So you can&#39;t set the property directly, because it is the wrong type. Therefore LoadProperty/ReadProperty are used to access the field value directly, bypassing the property entirely because it is the wrong type.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>loch006 replied on Wednesday, November 10, 2010</h2><p>ah, yes i started looking at that block in the dataportal_create method and noticed it was in the other methods as well but wasn&#39;t sure about its full purpose along with smartdate properties, thanks for clarifying this!</p>
<p>as always, thanks for a great product,&nbsp;CSLA has made software development here for me and my team&nbsp;a much more streamlined and logical process</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>loch006 replied on Thursday, November 11, 2010</h2><p>just out of curiosity why dont you use ByPassPropertyChecks in the child object dataportal methods? they are all just using LoadProperty it seems</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, November 11, 2010</h2><p>ProjectTracker is very out of date. It was really last updated for the 2008 book.</p>
<p>The best overall sample right now is Samples\Net\cs\SimpleNTier</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
