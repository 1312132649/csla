The point of CSLA is that it is agnostic to all data Storage techniques.</p>
<p>You should be aware that I am reworking the local data portal to be simpler, and to support async/await, so the next prerelease will be different than the current implementation.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
