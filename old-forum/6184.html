<P>&nbsp;Error&nbsp;1&nbsp;The type or namespace name 'var' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)&nbsp;</P>
<P>Has anyone else run into this issue?&nbsp; Were you able to get it to work, if so, how?</P>
<P>Rocky, any ideas?</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Saturday, January 17, 2009</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>CSLA 3.5 and up uses .NET 3.5, which is only supported in Visual Studio 2008.</FONT></P>

<P>I'll keep digging but I'm hoping that someone has been through this roadblock and can offer some valuable insight.</P>
<P>Thanks again.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, January 19, 2009</h2>You can reference the 3.5 assemblies all you want, but it's still using the 2.0 compiler.&nbsp; var is a 3.5 compiler feature, and I don't know of any way to make vs2005 use the 3.5 compiler.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, January 17, 2009</h2><P>CSLA .NET 3.5 requires VS 2008 and .NET 3.5. It uses language features of C# and VB that only exist in the .NET 3.5 compilers.</P>
<P>Once you compile the DLL you may be able to use it from VS 2005 projects, but you need the .NET 3.5 compilers to build Csla.dll.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>AaronH replied on Saturday, January 24, 2009</h2>Thanks Rocky, that ended up working great!&nbsp; Now to get my company to hop on the vs08 wagon..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>prabhatasp replied on Monday, February 02, 2009</h2>hi all,<br><br>i am not familier with CSLA.
