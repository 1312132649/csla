However is there an acceptable way to correct the edit level and replace the object?<br><br>Thankyou<br><br>Ashley<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, December 11, 2008</h2>If you are using CSLA .NET 3.6 (and probably 3.5), and your child object reference is maintained using a managed backing field (the new property syntax), then you should be able to set the value using LoadProperty() and have the edit level automatically managed for you.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
