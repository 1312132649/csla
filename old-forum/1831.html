The original value was null, and I tried both leaving the value unchanged and adding a value to it, to see if other null values would throw the same error.<br><br>I am thinking of a scenario where an update is made, you forget something, go right back to the same record and make an additional update.<br><br>I am currently unable to do this. <br><br>I would like to know if anyone else has observed this behavior.<br><br>Thank you,<br>jspurlin<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jspurlin replied on Wednesday, December 06, 2006</h2>I know, late nights, new framework, new paradigm (remoting), new design pattern(factory), and I ask some bad questions prematurely.<br><br>I finally discovered my issue.&nbsp; I was doing an update, testing a stored procedure not code, and I was not "rebinding" the data aware control, so that any fields left blank were "null" instead of bound to an intialized instance of the property I was trying to update with the business object.<br><br>The control had lost its state.<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
