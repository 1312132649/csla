<P>So my question is; is there a viable path to come up to speed on CSLA 3.5 right now?&nbsp; If so, what is it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I realize that most likely any answer given will be an opinion, but I value an educated opinion over a guess.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 14, 2008</h2><P>The 3.5 framework is not available yet - what's there is just preview code. I expect a beta release around the end of January. If I miss that, it'll be mid-Feb, as I'm full-time at a client (and traveling) for three weeks and won't get any serious framework work done during that time.</P>
<P>When talking about 3.5 there are two aspects to consider.</P>
<P>First, is .NET 3.5 support. It turns out that nothing in CSLA 3.5 is <EM>required</EM> for .NET 3.5. In other words, we're adding some nice features, but nothing that is absolutely cirtical. LINQ just doesn't have that big an impact.</P>
<P>This means that you can use 3.0.4 with .NET 3.5 and things will be just fine. The only thing you might want/need to do is back-port Csla.Data.ContextManager to make it easier to deal with LINQ data context objects.</P>
<P>Second are all the code-reduction features I'm doing in CSLA for 3.5. This is a much bigger deal, because it affects CSLA itself quite a lot, and because it means you can write around 35% less code per business class in many (most) cases. While this could technically be back-ported, it would be a <EM>lot</EM> of work because the changes are so extensive.</P>
<P>ProjectTracker.Library should offer a pretty good guide around these changes though. Mostly they simplify code and reduce the amount of knowledge required to build business objects with CSLA .NET.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeHaynes replied on Thursday, January 17, 2008</h2><P>Thanks for clearing that up a bit.&nbsp; ok we will look at CSLA 3.0.4 for are starting place.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
