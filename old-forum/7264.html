Basically, when you allow a subclass, you are providing an API that you can't change easily in the future, and your work is harder because you must consider what 3rd party developers MIGHT do when they override something.  So allowing subclasses isn't something that should be done lightly.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Monday, July 13, 2009</h2><P>indeed, that is why i thought it as well... but the main reason seems to be performance<BR>not having virtuals makes it 5 to 20 times faster (500% to 2000%)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
