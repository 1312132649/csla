<P>I've looked and many seem to be references or teach c# or .net etc.&nbsp; I'm more interested in a book that skips the basics and gets to the heart of *application* building with asp.net.&nbsp; I.E. best practices for laying out pages, supporting different browsers, forms etc etc.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 18, 2006</h2><P>For a long time Dave Sussman and Alex Homer were the authorities on ASP and ASP.NET programming - at least in terms of books. So you may want to see if they've got some current books out there.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
