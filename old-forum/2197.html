<P>The multiview control does not seem to support validators, or at least I can't seem to get them to work with the multiview control.</P>
<P>Has anyone had any success with this?</P>
<P>Regards,<BR>Gareth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Tuesday, January 23, 2007</h2><P>The only problems I've had with validators in any of the new "view" controls is establishing a reference to the correct control in the code-beside.&nbsp; Otherwise, I haven't had any problems.&nbsp; What are the symptoms you are witnessing?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Gareth replied on Tuesday, January 23, 2007</h2><P>I've simply not even managed to drop a validator on the form and link it to a control. How and where did you drop the validator on the form? And how did you link it up to the controls?</P>
<P>Do you have any examples?</P>
<P>Many thanks,<BR>Gareth.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Tuesday, January 23, 2007</h2><P>Ah, sorry, I don't usually work in Design Mode - I prefer direct coding.&nbsp; There I've had no problem entering the controls.</P>
<P>I don't have VS running but if memory serves me correctly, from the few times I have played in Design Mode, you should be able to drop a View control onto the MultiView then&nbsp;drag-n-drop the controls you want shown onto the&nbsp;View just like you would directly onto the page.&nbsp; A validator control shouldn't behave any differently.&nbsp; The other controls in the View should appear when you select the ControlToValidate property in the Properties Window - I'm assuming, I haven't tried that part.</P>
<P>HTH</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Gareth replied on Tuesday, January 23, 2007</h2><P>I can drop the validator control (required field validator) on the view itself but I am unable to select any controls to validate. I've now tried adding the validator control to various other sections of the form but I still get the same result - no controls being display in the ControlToValidate dropdown&nbsp;:(</P>
<P>Even if I try and code it in, without using the Visual Studio editor it errors everytime saying that the ControlToValidate field does not exist.</P>
<P>Do you happen to have a snapshot of some code where you are using a validator control and linking it successfully to a field?</P>

It was kind of a hack... If I recall correctly, he wrote some code in the page that looped through the contents of the ListView and dynamically added validation controls.</P>
<P>Basically you have two options: change your ListView fields all to template fields, or use Francesco's hack.</P>
<P>It is my understanding that if you change your fields to template fields, then the template can contain validation controls along with any other controls. Whether you can do this on the web forms design surface I'm not sure, but you can certainly do it by typing the tags into the aspx page.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
