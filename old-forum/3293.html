<P>If I build a collection class that inherits from BusinessListBase like so:</P><FONT color=#0000ff>
<P><FONT face="Courier New">Inherits</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Courier New"> BusinessListBase(<FONT color=#0000ff>Of</FONT> Employees, Employee)</FONT></P>
<P>The business object will&nbsp; NOT show up in the Website Data Sources tab.&nbsp; However, if I build my collection class like this:</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><FONT color=#0000ff>Inherits</FONT> List(<FONT color=#0000ff>Of</FONT> Employee)</FONT></P>
<P>It will work just fine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it isn't just a matter of leaving all the code the same and inheriting from a different collection base <EM><STRONG>- the constructor cannot be private either</STRONG></EM>.&nbsp; If the constructor is made private the item will stop showing up in the Website Data Sources tab.</P>
<P>Anyone found a way around this?<FONT size=2></P></FONT></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
