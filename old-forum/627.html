On top of giving us a great framework for the cost of a book (not even that if you don't want <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /> ) , he is also providing this forum for no charge (in my opinion one of the most useful and helpful forums I have come across for a while).</P>
<P>If Rocky wants to make some extra cents to cover his hosting bill he has every right. (Rocky, stick a PayPal donation button on this site as well&nbsp;- I think it deserves it <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" />)</P>

<P>I agree. While I have no issues with a free web site doing whatever they want, I gotta say that my left eye hurts now every time I go here.</P>
<P>I like the ads because I'm hoping that it'll cover some costs. They are hard to look at, though.</P>
