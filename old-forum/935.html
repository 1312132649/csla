<br>
Right after my private fields in my business object I decalre another
set of&nbsp; string variables for each field which are prefixed with
'fn' to which I assign the name of each field. <br>
<br>
Then in all my Can Reads and Can Writes I use those fn variables (which
avoids any reflection), and in fetching parameters I also use them
avoiding dependency on field positions in result sets. <br>
<br>
So as long as I spell them correct once, there spelt correctly throughout the application.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Des<br>

We name things (all things)&nbsp;to identify them and to make our lives <STRONG><EM>easier</EM></STRONG> - not more difficult.</P>
<P>Only in a colony of idiots people will start a custom where case sensitivity of a name is meant to be a differentaiting factor - like "my name is 'James', but my brother is named 'james'"</P>

I've personally always found it silly to have to prepend some random character to force some artifical difference to distinguish between private fields and public properties.<br><br><br><br>Andy<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Friday, August 18, 2006</h2><P>As I understand it, the C# and the VB version of the Csla library can both be used to support C# and VB classes.</P>
<P>If case sensitivity is removed from the Csla library, it will not be able to properly support a C# module.</P>
<P>It may not affect you, but it would affect others.</P>
