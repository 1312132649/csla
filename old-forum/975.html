<P>This is a bit more general than CSLA, but given the knowledge here thought it would be a good place.</P>
<P>Assuming a&nbsp;business layer with Data Transfer Objects for communicating with the DAL, how should this be implemented at the UI layer.</P>
<P>If we have a data intensive UI (intranet in my case) how should the data best be transferred between the BL and UI.&nbsp; One option is to reference the DTOs at the UI level and instantiate them there - add the new/edited data to the object and then pass it to the BO for saving/validation (this is just an example) - this has the benefit of ensuring type safety at all levels, but also breaks the separation model.</P>
<P>The other option is to call your method in the BL with parameters - should this be named parameters, a datarow or any other option?</P>
<P>I also tend to use generics for binding to data grids etc. rather than datasets - is this correct?</P>
<P>Any thoughts/experiences gratefully received!</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

Too simple to really support data binding (at least for Windows Forms) in a good way. This is one of the primary benefits of using CSLA to create business objects: your objects fully support data binding, allowing for an abstract and fully supported way to allow your UI to interact with the objects.<br><br>If your DAL is DTO-based, that's fine. Just create your CSLA business objects so their DataPortal_XYZ methods use the DTOs to load/persist the business object data through the DAL.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
