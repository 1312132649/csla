I read a post from 2006 where somebody suggested to catch the exception in the dataportal and when it's a unique contraint or primary key error to add a broken rule to the BO. Now I really don't like messing with Rockies code, but may be someone has some suggestions how to implement such broken rule exception handling?<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
