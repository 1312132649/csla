<DIV>Remember that you need full trust for CSLA which you generally won't get with low cost shared hosting. A virtual server is probably the only safe alternative to your own server. The Windows VPS at&nbsp;<A href="http://www.jodohost.com/">http://www.jodohost.com</A>&nbsp;looks pretty good. Its better than others at comparable prices because it includes use of SQL Server on another machine. I haven't used it myself but I use their shared hosting and monitor their forums and I'm very happy with them.</DIV>

<DIV>Despite my first comment, I read recently on a forum that <A href="http://www.discountasp.com">http://www.discountasp.com</A>&nbsp;allows full trust on their shared hosting. I don't know if&nbsp;that's really true and/or is a cause for concern. Their page lists the ReportViewer control as being available which seems to require full trust and is the reason I was looking on that particular forum. I know nothing about how good they are.</DIV>
