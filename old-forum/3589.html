It would just 'stop responding' in the middle of a debug session or even just when editing code. This is happening all the time, I'm lucky if I can work for more than 15 minutes...</P>
<P>My configuration:</P>
<P>Dell D9200, Core 2 Duo E6700 2,66Ghz, 4Gb RAM<BR>Windows Vista Ultimate 32bit<BR>VS-2005 Professional SP1 + SP1 for Vista</P>
<P>I've already removed the update for VS2005 wich was automatically installed on 12-sep.<BR>I've disabled 'Edit and Continue'<BR>I am starting VS2005 with 'Run as Administrator'<BR><BR>Anyone else having problems ? Any ideas on how to solve this ?</P>

That did it for me.<br><br>Any other plugins?<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
