I want to create an object to take the payload to the application server and then perform the logging. I don't want this object to be returned. I'm looking for a one way, fire and forget type of method call. Does CLSA support this. Everything I've seen returns values back to the client.</P>
<P>I could easily do this with WCF or plain asmx services, but I want to keep consistant with the rest of the app.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
