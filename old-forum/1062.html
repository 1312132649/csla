<P>Please forgive me, but I am still new to Business Objects and still somewhat trapped by the relational programming mindset.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P>

Your post doesn't&nbsp; provide enough detail to give you guidance in that regard.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jkellywilkerson replied on Tuesday, August 29, 2006</h2><P>Thanks for the reply Rocky.&nbsp; I have done a little digging in the previous posts looking at "grandchildren" specific posts, but I can not find anything related to the switchable object.&nbsp; My initial guess was that, if a child was also a parent, it must be a switchable object.</P>
<P>For instance, I have the following object hierarchy:</P>
<P>Group (BusinessBase - Editable Root)</P>
<P>-- Participants (BusinessListBase - Editable Child Collection)</P>
<P>-- Participant (BusinessBase - Editable Child)</P>
<P>-- -- Dependents (BusinessListBase - Editable Child Collection)</P>
<P>-- -- Dependent (BusinessBase - Editable Child)</P>
<P>In this scenario, does the Participant BO have to be switchable?&nbsp; Is this type of setup only for Master/Detail forms display?&nbsp; I am not completely sure that I want to go down this path, just because of the amount of data that will be required for some Group BO's.</P>
<P>I am more inclined to make all three BO's Editable Root objects and use the ID fields from the respective ancestor when creating the child; then using ReadOnlyList and ReadOnlyInfo objects to provide general information for linking.</P>
<P>Does that sound better?</P>
<P>Thanks again,</P>
<P>Kelly.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, August 29, 2006</h2>Hi Kelly,<br><br>I'd think that Participant isn't supposed to be a child at all.&nbsp; Particpant would be for editing the particpant, which I assume can be done independantly of the editing of the Group?&nbsp; Most likely Particpant would become ParticipantInfo, a read only object who's presense in the list indicates they are a member of the group, but nothing more.&nbsp; The participants class would likely become GroupParticipants.. and it would manage the relationship between a group and participant.<br><br>Again, a Dependant would likely be its own root object; Dependants would manage the relationship between the dependant and particpant.&nbsp; <br><br>Make sense?<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, August 29, 2006</h2>"Parent" and "root" are not the same thing. A "root" object is directly persistable, while a "parent" object has child objects. So a root might or might not be a parent, and a parent might or might not be a root. If a parent is not a root, then it is also a child.<br><br>Switchable is a stereotype that can be a root or child. Whether it is also a parent or not doesn't matter - the stereotype says that the object can be instantiated as a root (handling its own persistence) or a child (its parent handles its persistence).<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jkellywilkerson replied on Tuesday, August 29, 2006</h2><P>Thanks Rocky,</P>
<P>This new idea of Business Objects is so new to me that it's like a dense fog consuming me.&nbsp; It's a bit overwhelming to make the transition from old-school data-driven relational development to object-oriented functional development.</P>
<P>From what I have been able to glean from the book (C# 2005 version) and the forum so far, this appears to be what I've need for a long time.</P>
<P>I originally purchased the VB5 BO book when it first came out, but due to time pressures, was never really able get in depth with it (much to my demise).&nbsp; Now I have come to my senses.</P>
<P>Thanks for a great book and framework.&nbsp; It will just take me a little while to get up to speed.</P>
<P>Kelly.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jkellywilkerson replied on Tuesday, August 29, 2006</h2><P>Thanks Andy,</P>
<P>It makes perfect sense.&nbsp; I was a bit worried about having such a deep hierarchy because I could potentially have 50,000 Groups and each Group could potentially have 1,000 to 50,000 Participants, etc.&nbsp; That does not even touch on the other issues such as the Products available to a Group and the Products that each Participant enrolls in.&nbsp; My intitial thoughts were that the system is going to be so slow that it's not even usable.</P>
<P>So do I assume correctly that an Editable Root Collection - Editable Root - Editable Child Collection - Editable Child setup is for a DataViewGrid Master/Detail View of the data only?</P>
<P>The Master/Detail scenario with that much data does not seem very manageable or does it?</P>
<P>Thanks again Andy,</P>
