If there is not what would you think would be the way to go at it?<br><br>Thanks.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Sunday, November 19, 2006</h2><P>You post is very vague but if you mean "Is there a way business objects can observe one another?" then you should also look as Petar Kazul's ActiveObjects implementation.&nbsp; It's an add-on to Csla with very nice Observer Pattern implementation.</P>

But Petar's ActiveObjects do. He implemented a set of subclasses that derive from the core CSLA classes and they come with a full-fledged observer pattern. <br><br>But beware!<br><br>You should think very hard, for every use case again, whether the desired information propagation is something that is 'true BO logic' or whether it's just UI-logic. In your example, I would argue it's just something that concerns your UI. So don't modify your BOs to get some UI behavior in place, rather enhance your UI with events (or perhaps use Petar's Channel/Subscriber code on the UI level). <br><br>I use CAB (Composite UI App Block) which comes with a great event-broadcasting framework (EventBroker). I have found that I could go without Observers in my BOs so far since all my communications needs turned out to be just UI-specific, and these could be dealt with using the eventbroker. I do not recommend using CAB though unless you really feel that you (like me) will eventually get return on the relatively large learning investment (steep learning curve guaranteed there ;-) ).<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Bayu<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>oswaldo_hp replied on Tuesday, November 21, 2006</h2><P>Hay thanks for the answer, I have not looked in much into CAB. However, form what IÂ´ve it's basically designed to be used with the business logi implemented as a set of web services.</P>
<P>This clashes with my current architecture. My current physical architecture is formed by 2 tiers. Client Side -&gt; UI, Business Logic, Ddata Access Code&nbsp;and Server Side -&gt; Database, Stored Procedures and the like. This is because thye application is to be used by a limited number of users (15 Max.). </P>
<P>I am thinking of using something like CSLA because the business logic is intricate (i's based on a mathematical Operations Research Model). Have you tried to use the CAB with CSLA?, What kind of architectures is CAB designed to support?. I was also wondering how long it took you to master CAB since in the last post you said something about a deep learning curve.</P>
<P>On the other hand, have any of you found an already done and tried approach to Event Broker (either Observer or Publisher-Subscriber) for the UI. I could try code it myself, however I would not like to reinvent the wheel.</P>
<P>BTW, I also experienced the exceptions you talk about and they are not very nice.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bayu replied on Tuesday, November 21, 2006</h2>CAB builds on a <i>services </i>oriented architecture, not web services.&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br>It fully integrates with your UI, so there is no clash with your current architecture in that respect.<br><br>I have successfully integrated CAB and CSLA yes, it sounds so scary ...

<P>I already downloaded the CAB and the&nbsp;Smart Client Software Factory, so I'll start with that in order to see what it's all about. I'll also look Szymon's blog. Anyway, I've got a couple of weeks to research on this so I can make a final decision on the UI.</P>
