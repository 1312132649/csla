<P>My question is this: should I migrate from 2.0 to 2.1 and then, once comfortable with it, migrate to 3.0?&nbsp; Or should I go directly from 2.0 to 3.0?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Sunday, August 17, 2008</h2><P>I would go to 3.5 - latest released version.</P>
<P>Rocky keeps running into databinding bugs and fixes them as best as possible in each later version. Databinding is *much* harder to support than anyone realized at the start of this - but Rocky is pretty close now.</P>
<P>Be sure to get the 2 eBooks from Rocky so you can read about the changes in the framework.</P>
<P>Then you need to search this forum to read about managed properties - a recent breakthrough in code reduction and ease of use - but not in a book yet. You do not have to make the jump to managed properties (yet) - there is plenty more to catch up on first. But I think they are the future given that CSLA Light is going to require them. So if you plan to ever get into Silverlight you should be comfortable with them. I think the key is that Silverlight does not allow reflection and managed properties allow Rocky to write serialization and deserialization code without using reflection.</P>

It's well worth finding the time to come up to speed on 3.5. The reduction in code around the use of collections is very cool. It's nice to have that baked into framework and to be correct every time without the possibility of me forgetting something.<br><br>I suggest that you study the ProjectTracker example for managed properties and how collections are fetched and saved.<br><br>Also, see the various notes about managed properties, changes etc that Rocky has written <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Default.aspx">here</a><br><br>Ross<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
