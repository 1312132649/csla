This is SOA to me. Am I right or am I wrong?<br><br>Since this is a WPF UI at the top, this means you could/should build objects per Use Case, and say that we have an external application/system that needs to save/get data, then we will expose a service for that case.<br><br>Is there any example using CSLA and SOA?<br><br>Rocky, could you compare CSLA and StockTrader?<br><br>Best regards<br>Maqster<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
