<p>Also, if not specified it defaults to serializable (the previous CSLA&nbsp;behavior). &nbsp;Has any consideration been given to providing an application level override to the Isolation Level? &nbsp;(We&#39;ve implemented this ourselves, but had to change CSLA classes to do it - which we try to avoid to make upgrading easier). &nbsp;Especially since .NET SQL server drivers keep the last isolation level when using an app pool - so even data reads for reports, etc end up using serializable when they don&#39;t really need to (another option to avoid this is to use different connection strings to the same database for different types of connections).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
