<p style="padding-left:30px;">I have a windows forms app that is working with MSSQL Server 2008 and CSLA 3.5.&nbsp; Can you tell me what is the best&nbsp; way to migrate my application to work on Windows Azure? Is there a way to host the database, dataportal and bussines layer on the cloud and work with proxy classes on the client side so the client has only the UI installed on the machine?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 19, 2012</h2><p>You can use SQL Azure to put the database in Azure. And you can use a web role to host the data portal in Azure.</p>
<p>The client part of the application should be unaffected. It obviously still runs on the client workstation, and the data portal works the same - at least if you are using WCF as the communication channel for the data portal.</p>
<p>I say all that - but to be honest, I&#39;ve only _tested_ using CSLA 3.8 with Azure. I see no reason 3.5 wouldn&#39;t work as well, assuming you are using WCF for network communication.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 19, 2012</h2><p>Although it focuses on CSLA 4, not 3.5, the <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration</em> book covers the use of Azure to host the data portal.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brad Rem replied on Friday, August 09, 2013</h2><p>@Radoslav, did you ever migrate your WinForms app to Azure?&nbsp; I have a WinForm project where I was uanble to get the local WinForm app to correctly communicate with the Azure-based data portal.&nbsp; I&#39;m hoping you were able to get it to work and provide some pointers.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
