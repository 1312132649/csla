This makes it difficult to notify the user of the reason their login attempt failed. Some possible reasons are: incorrect username password combination, password has expired, user account is inactive, server not accepting logins at this time etc.<br /><br />The reason is detected in the DataPortal_Fetch method of the AppIdentity.Server.cs. The question is how to return that reason to the user. Is there a better method than to simply add a reason property to the AppIdentity class?<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br />Russ<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 03, 2010</h2>That seems like a reasonable solution. The IIdentity already has IsAuthenticated. If that value is false, it seems reasonable to think there could be a AuthenticationFailureReason property to explain why. Normally it would be null, because normally the user would be authenticated, so the overhead would be quite low.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
