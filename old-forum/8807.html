<p>CSLA 4 requires Visual Studio 2010, .NET 4 and (optionally) Silverlight 
4.</p>
<p>There are a lot of changes in CSLA 4 - make sure to read the change log!</p>
<p>This will be the last preview, and it includes all planned CSLA 4 functionality <i>except</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>New authorization rules system</li>
<li>INotifyDataErrorInfo support (SL only)</li>
<li>Class level DataAnnotation attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>My intent is to finish these three items within the next two weeks, and then enter a beta phase.</p>
<p>Your feedback now and through the beta phase is absolutely invaluable to the quality of the release. If you are using or planning to use .NET 4 or Silverlight 4 please take a look at the preview and let me know your thoughts and any bugs you find.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Saturday, April 17, 2010</h2><p>Good news!</p>
<p>Are you planning to post documentation for the new authorization rules system?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, April 17, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;ll do a blog post like I did with validation rules before the beta release.</p>
<p>And I&#39;ll be writing an ebook once CSLA 4 is done - but writing a book takes some time, so it won&#39;t be out instantly <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>
<p>I&#39;m exploring ideas around e-content, where the ebook content would be available in incremental stages. Somewhat like book publishers are doing with their &quot;beta book&quot; programs - you buy the book before it is out and get access to some of the raw content as it is being created. I don&#39;t know what people think about that idea - it would require some work on my end because I don&#39;t have a system to do this at the moment - but it would be a way to get the content out quicker (if at lower quality to start with).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Sunday, April 18, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b></p>

<div style="CLEAR:both;"></div>
</div></p>
<p>That would be a nice idea because a full book takes a long time to finish.</p>
<p>I imagine it could be like:this:</p>
<ul>
<li>beta 1 - with introduction, chapters 6, 7 and 10 covering the news aspect of v.4.</li>
<li>beta 2 - with some rewriting of previous issues and 2 new chapters</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds nice <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lukky replied on Sunday, April 18, 2010</h2><p>Rocky,</p>
<p>e-books might be nice, but I&#39;d rather have videos if you&#39;re going to create &quot;ongoing&quot; content.</p>
<p>And if I&#39;m not mistaken, a video is quicker to produce.</p>
<p>Regards</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Thursday, April 22, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;ve got a new Silverlight 4 project I need to get started on.&nbsp; I was thinking of trying to use the CSLA 4.0 preview instead of a hacked 3.8.&nbsp; I installed the msi for the CSLA 4.0 preview but I can&#39;t get the 4.0 preview samples to compile.&nbsp; Specifically I&#39;ve&nbsp;tried the&nbsp;SimpleApp and the Rolodex samples.&nbsp;&nbsp;They both have errors&nbsp;that the the namespace CSLA.Validation does not exist.&nbsp; I&#39;m guessing this sample has not been updated for the new rule system or perhaps something&nbsp;simpler like I&#39;m missing a reference.&nbsp; I can&#39;t find it though.&nbsp; Any help would be great.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, April 22, 2010</h2><p>We haven&#39;t had time to update the samples yet - that&#39;ll happen during the beta period.</p>
<p>ProjectTracker builds in CSLA 4, and at least the basic functionality of the MVC and Windows Forms applications is there.</p>
<p>The closest thing to a working Silverlight sample is the UsingBxf and Collective samples from the VS Launch event</p>

<p>We are about to start new project in WPF and consider using CSLA 4. Our&nbsp;concern&nbsp;is that we don&#39;t know what is the estimate time for final release. I really like the changes in CSLA 4 comparing to 3.x but not knowing final release date poses some obvious risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Maxim.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GregDobbs replied on Saturday, May 01, 2010</h2><p>Very much looking forward to CSLA 4. With the release of VS 2010 and SL4, CSLA 4 has become integral to a major development initiative based on state-of-the-art technologies. We don&#39;t want to start down the road using CSLA 3.8 when the next-greatest thing is right around the corner! Rocky - thanks for all of your incredible time and devotion to getting this out - we know you&#39;re doing your utmost!!!!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, May 01, 2010</h2><p>I will release Beta 1 the week of May 3.</p>
<p>The typical beta process takes 6-8 weeks. Never shorter, but possibly longer depending on the type of feedback provided by this community as they use the beta.</p>
<p>This means CSLA 4 should be complete around the end of June or early July.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GregDobbs replied on Saturday, May 01, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;d be very interested in migrating to the Beta for my latest SL initiative and providing feedback on my experience. </p>
<p>Do you anticipate releasing BO templates that define the new methods, etc. under the new paradigm for each BO type? Those are obviously of great value in developing code-generation templates and understanding the new framework. </p>
<p>It would also be useful to know if there are certain areas that might undergo breaking changes as we move through the stages of Beta testing - any areas that you feel might still require a bit of rework or are less than fully developed (authorization, etc).</p>
<p>.Thanks again!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GregDobbs replied on Saturday, May 01, 2010</h2><p>Ah - I see templates under the Preview version that I just downloaded. Never mind! :-)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, May 01, 2010</h2><p>At this time I don&#39;t anticipate major feature changes during the beta process. Any breaking changes will be as a result of the need to address bugs or something like that - which of course I can&#39;t predict :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Monday, May 03, 2010</h2><p>I downloaded the preview source.&nbsp; When I compile 0 projects actually compile.&nbsp; It looks like the build configuration is setup to not compile anything.&nbsp; I opened the CSLA-all solution.&nbsp; Is this correct?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, May 03, 2010</h2><p>I have noticed that VS10 sometimes defaults to a &quot;Win32&quot; build target. You need to change this to &quot;Any CPU&quot;, otherwise all projects are skipped. I doubt you want to build for Win32 anyway, so I&#39;m not sure why that&#39;d be a default...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>wjcomeaux replied on Monday, May 03, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;ve noticed that there is not a CSLA Light version of 4.0 but you mention that Silverlight 4 is optional. Is the CSLA Light branch no longer necessary due to changes in .NET or will that be coming at a later date?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Will</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, May 03, 2010</h2><p>CSLA 4 is a unified release - so it directly includes support for .NET and Silverlight in the same downloads.</p>
<p>And at some point later this year I expect that it will also include Windows Phone.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>wjcomeaux replied on Monday, May 03, 2010</h2><p>Once again, you guys are fantastic. My build team will relish this information.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
