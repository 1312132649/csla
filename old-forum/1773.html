So when a record is requested, the providerId is there as an index to ensure only objects for the specific provider are returned.<br><br>But what if I request "roles for <b>providerId 1</b>" and as the same time someone else requests "roles for <b>providerId 2</b>".&nbsp; THEN, <b>providerId 2</b> makes changes to the role and Invalidates the cache. How do I ensure the cache for <b>provider 1</b> is not Invalidated(). Worse, could <b>providerId 1</b> request roles in the same context if a &lt;NameValueListBase&gt; object _list is not null and bind to the other providers roles?<br><br>I am currently working with the local proxy on a single machine, just getting things set up.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
