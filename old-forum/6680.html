But the link to this version does not work...<br />http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/permalink/10836/10948/ShowThread.aspx#10948<br /><br />I've also downloaded the Windows CE version of CSLA wich has the dataportal on it. <br /><br />In my case, I don't think I should use it as I won't have any communications in my device excepting for some little and specific moments.<br /><br />So, at least, my questions are:<br /><br />Should I remove dataportal from ths version I've downloaded to get it working correctly on WM5?<br /><br />Should I do domething more to get ready for implementation?<br /><br />Thanks a lot  :)<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
