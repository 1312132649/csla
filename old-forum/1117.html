<P>The best way is to&nbsp;store the object in session state between the pages.<BR><BR>Solution 1:<BR>Page1:<BR>Session("object") = YourObject<BR><BR>Page 2:<BR>Dim obj As YourObjectType = DirectCast(Session("object"), YourObjectType)<BR><BR>This is the most performant solution, although it doesn't scale as good as solution 2l.</P>
<P>Solution 2:<BR>If you are reluctant to use session state, one alternative is to store the object in the database on page 1, and&nbsp;send the id of the object,&nbsp;via the querystring,&nbsp;to page 2 and reload it there. This is the most scalable solution but doesn't perform so well. <BR><BR>Hope this helps</P>
