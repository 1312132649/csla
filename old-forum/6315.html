<P>(I'm creating a WPF data form)</P>
<P>For example, I've got a business object with three properties, ID, Name and Age.&nbsp; The Save&nbsp;menu item is bound to the object so it's enabled/disabled properties act accordingly which is what I want.&nbsp; There is one exception though.&nbsp; If I first update the Name, the Save button enables as it should.&nbsp; But if I then update the Age without&nbsp;tabbing out of the control I can't successfully Save the data I entered as the control never loses focus when a menu item is selected.&nbsp; (The Name is updated but the Age isn't)</P>
<P>Is this effect a desired result or what am I missing to resolve this.&nbsp; My users don't want to&nbsp;tab out of the last field their updating.&nbsp; They just like to mouse over to the Save menu.&nbsp; Right now if I leave it the way things are they'll end up losing the last fields updates.</P>
<P>Thoughts???</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, February 02, 2009</h2><P>This is an ancient problem - it is not new to WPF.</P>
<P>You can try and find an event which you can handle and then re-set the focus yourself so that the last value is "posted" to the BO when the user clicks the menu. </P>
<P>Note: The event you are looking for&nbsp;is not in the Menu but somewhere in the form or grid.</P>

I do that for toolbar buttons because they don't do the validate (and therefore send the data to the object) either.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
