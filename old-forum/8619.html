<p>I am Sorting and FIltering a BusinessList with the help of a LinqBindingList. But now I am getting some strange behaviour.</p>
<p>I was iterating through my LBL with a foreach-statement. Everything worked fine, but now the foreach does not take only filtered items (e.g. 58 item) but all 1000 from set BL.</p>
<p>Did the LBL behaviour change? I am sure it worked with an older Version of CSLA (Now we are using 3.8.1). I am not using Sum because this was causing bad performance...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
