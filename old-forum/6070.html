<P>I'm using code complete and trying to get my business objects to execute on the application server (iis7), I have purchased the 2008 book which says I need to do a couple to setup: WcfPortal.svc, bin, web.config.</P>
<P>I guess I'm trying to figure out if its something I'm not understanding about csla or code complete. The call gets executed through the wcf service but an error is returned to the client. I've stepped through the code but unfortunately did not make sense of it...</P>
<P>&nbsp;//Screen cast</P>

I've stepped through the code but it doesn't return anything revealing. Which is why I was hoping someone could help. </P>
