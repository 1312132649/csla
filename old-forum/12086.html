<p>Kindly help.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Wednesday, July 24, 2013</h2><p>Inherently there isn&#39;t a broken rules collection for a BusinessListBase.</p>
<p>There are various helper methods that others use and that I know I use that provide for &quot;AllBrokenRules&quot; or what have you, where a list of all broken rules throughout the entire object graph can be garnered.</p>
<p>You could add a property on your collection to basically merge all of the broken rules of each child, but there is nothing inherently built in.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, July 24, 2013</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>There is even a built-in helper method in BusinessRules.GetAllBrokenRules()</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
