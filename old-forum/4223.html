<P>Is it possible to replicate the DataSet.Merge functionality within our list business objects.&nbsp; I do not want to recreate the wheel if this has already been addressed.&nbsp; I have a MasterList BO, and a CurrentList BO.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to&nbsp;call a&nbsp;method &nbsp;that could&nbsp;discover&nbsp;all of the inserted&nbsp; and updated records that the current List has when compared to the Master List object.&nbsp; Do I have to do this manually within a method of the MasterList object?&nbsp; For example use&nbsp;a foreach/for construct and compare the key values of &nbsp;each item in the Current list&nbsp; to&nbsp; the corresponding item of the Master list in order to determine if it is new or changed item?</P>
<P>Thanks for your help</P>

<P>The problem is that I have&nbsp;1 file that must be submitted to an outside vendor once a week.&nbsp; The&nbsp; file (Master - Biz Obj) contains apprx 800 records and will continue to grow by about 10% a year.&nbsp; The file holds the records of each employee enrolled in the program.&nbsp; Weekly adjustments are made to this file (Master BO)&nbsp;based on Current database values that generate a new Master.&nbsp; For example, employee changes must be logged, and new employees must be added to this file (BO).&nbsp; So I am working from two list objects Master and Current.&nbsp; I use the Current to upate the Master.&nbsp; That is why I thought the DataSet.Merge functionality would have been ideal.&nbsp; In looking at List Processing I saw where obj.IndexOf(item, StartingIdx) would have been a decent solution.&nbsp; But the CSLA list processing does not implement this second IndexOf method.&nbsp; IE I have to iterate through the entire (Master) list from the beginning for each Current list item, rather than starting at the last index found.&nbsp; Is there a CSLA solution that I am overlooking??&nbsp; Are DataSets a better solution to this problem?? </P>
<P>Any suggestions of how to implement this solution is appreciated.&nbsp; I do not know if this is possible within the CSLA framework.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</P>

<P>Alternately, do you have (or can add) a ModifiedOn field to your Current objects, and just get a list of objects that have changed since the Master was updated last?</P>

Just keep two iterators moving forward. </P>
