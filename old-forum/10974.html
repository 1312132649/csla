<p>Certainly there&nbsp;is&nbsp;value in this, but to contrast my thoughts, I just want to say that I&nbsp;am thinking of creating a different kind of code generation project - one that would be more or less a loose&nbsp;collection of tools&nbsp;to generate, or help to generate, CSLA code.&nbsp; Users could pick and choose what they felt was relevant to their needs.</p>
<p>I am new to Csla, but my programming interests in the past&nbsp;have&nbsp;centered on writing utilities.&nbsp; With this interest, I don&#39;t think it would be long before I would write some simple tools that generate or facilitate CSLA code.</p>
<p>While writing this post, &nbsp;my thoughts suggest that&nbsp;what I am describing&nbsp;is more&nbsp;a &quot;contribution&quot;&nbsp;than a project, but I still think of a project because&nbsp;simple code generation tools can grow.&nbsp;To me, a contribution is generally&nbsp;something that is given at one point in time.</p>
<p>But this effort, like a contribution, would be something that is not sold.&nbsp; Value to me would be from&nbsp;feedback, whether user comments or discussion.</p>
<p>At this point I&#39;ll stop writing and&nbsp;listen&nbsp;for input.</p>

<p>I&#39;m the coordinator of CslaContrib so in terms of contribution that may be a place to start. </p>
<p>CslaContrib is a collection of sample code projects and contributions that doesn&#39;t make it into the framework itself.</p>
<p>Have you looked at CslaGenFork (<a href="http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com">http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com</a>) ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tallan replied on Monday, December 12, 2011</h2><p>I&#39;ll download cslagen Fork and try it out.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
