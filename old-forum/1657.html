Or is simply having the EditableSwitchable enough and you then create them as whichever you need?</P>
<P>Working with a code generator I am trying to&nbsp; derive as many objects from the metadata as possible and I am wondering if I should go ahead and create all 3 types or just create the EditableSwitchable.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>But beware.&nbsp; I can certainly understand was you would want to create _all_ of your objects as swtichable objects, but a switchable object is in most cases a sign of bad design.</P>
<P>I think you should nail down your object's responsibility and then create (generate) the appropriate root or child objects as required.&nbsp; You should, at least IMHO, put the breaks on using nothing but switchable objects.</P>
<P>Anyway, that is my 2 cents :(</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Wednesday, November 01, 2006</h2><P>Sorry to jump in here, but this brings up something I've wondered about since using CSLA.</P>
<P>I've never used a switchable object, and the mantra is it's usually bad design to do so. But it's included in the framework, so I guess there are valid reasons to use a switchable object? Can anyone give an example of when it's a good idea to use a switchable object?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>I will remove my generation for EditableSwitchable and simply generate the Parent and Child objects.</P>
<P>This clarifies a lot.</P>
<P>And yes, I am addicted to CodeSmith now. I am currently working a master template to generate a bulk of my business objects and all of my stored procedures.</P>

<P>EditableSwitchable is a class type for objects that are times root and times child of another object or collection.</P>
<P>If you create your objects as EditableSwitchable you dont have to do the other two, but having&nbsp;all objects as editableSwitchable will make them do a lot of extra work and expose it to possible miss-usage by the UI.</P>
