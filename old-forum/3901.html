put the responsibility for this on the controller, as this is
presentation logic, not business logic....<br></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>Notice that not only does this person have the purpose of the controller highly confused, it blantantly wrong in saying that security is the responsibility of the presentation logic.&nbsp; Obviously to him security such as 'allow add', 'allow delete', etc is based upon what pages you can get to and if someone were to hit the back end model they'd have feast of opportunity to do whatever the heck they want because there's no security (or data validation).<br><br>Don't let people like this spoil it for the rest of us!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
