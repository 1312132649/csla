<p>Any ways, it just seems to have a better logical organization and feels more complete.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ability to get the lastest corrected version is an additional benefit.</p>
<p>Nice work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have access to the&nbsp;information&nbsp;now rather that having to wait months (and months) for a paper book to be published.</p>
<p>It is much quicker to read a section in an ebook than to search through&nbsp;forum&nbsp;posts; best practice can change over time and some&nbsp;forum&nbsp;posts refer to old versions/practices of Csla.</p>
<p>I have found the pdf bookmarks added to the &nbsp;&#39;Creating Business Objects&#39; ebook great for quickly drilling down to the information I need. &nbsp;I&#39;m hoping Rocky will add bookmarks to all the books as it is much&nbsp;easier than searching or using the contents pages.</p>
<p>With tablet and slate devices ebooks are now much easier to read cover to cover;&nbsp;amongst&nbsp;other things there is no laptop fan noise to&nbsp;disturb people around me!&nbsp;(This used to be a drawback of ebooks.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall a tumbs ups for the content and ebook format.&nbsp;</p>
