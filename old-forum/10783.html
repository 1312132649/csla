<p>I&#39;ve come across an odd scenario where a call to any of the N-Level undo related methods, such as BeginEdit(), causes an &#39;object reference not set to an instance of an object&#39; exception. The object that I&#39;m calling BeginEdit() on was built with CSLA 2.1.4 (I have other versions installed in my GAC), and I have a reference to the project that contains this object in a simple win forms app that creates an instance of the object via a standard CSLA factory method and then calls BeginEdit() on it. </p>
<p>If I build the win forms project with a &nbsp;later version to 2.1.4 from the GAC I get the exception in UndoableBase in the CopyState method when it tries to get a list of fields for the current object. This exception is not being thrown if I reference version 2.1.4 of CSLA. I do realise that I can probably just compile a new version of the old project using the latest version of CSLA and that should solve it, but I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas why this is happening?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
