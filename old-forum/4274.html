<P>I am still very much a Csla 2&nbsp;user so if this has been done in 3.0 or 3.5 then ignore (tho a quick note on here to say so would be appreciated)</P>
<P>I am heavily dependant on code generation. I some times need to know if a property has been changed. At the moment I hook the PropertyChanged event in my handcrafted partial class, which sems to me to be more expensive than it needs to be. I am on .Net 2.0 at the moment so generating&nbsp;a notification method call in&nbsp;the property set code means&nbsp;that the handrafted partial needs jhas to have handling&nbsp;code in&nbsp;it. Of course when&nbsp;I&nbsp;get up to 3.5 i can use partial methods, better. However then i will be moving to CSLA 3.5 where, from what I understand. property changed stuff gets buried in the framework. Perhaps the property change stuff could call a virtual&nbsp;method, say OnPropertyHasChanged(PropertyInfo info).</P>
<P>As I said, not a life and death issue, more about keeping things tidy.</P>

<P>Ps: And yes I could go and read all the later docs - this is just a passing thought</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>amselem replied on Friday, February 01, 2008</h2><P>Just a quick comment, I think that you can use partial methods with .net runtime 2.0 without problems because is a compiler feature not a language one. So you can build it with the 3.5 compiler but target the .net 2.0 platform and get this feature (and others too, like type inference). <BR>HTH</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>simon_may replied on Friday, February 01, 2008</h2>Thanks for the tip. I'll try it when I upgrade to VS2008</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 01, 2008</h2><P>PropertyHasChanged() is virtual, so you can override that method to find out when a property has been changed.</P>
<P>Just make sure to call the base implementation first, so the normal processing occurs before you try to respond!!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>simon_may replied on Friday, February 01, 2008</h2><P>Not surprised, you are that sort of fellow. Teach me not to investigate further. Thanks</P>
