<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: There was an error while trying to deserialize parameter <A href="https://ws.lhotoka.net/wcfdataportal:request">https://ws.lhotoka.net/wcfdataportal:request</A>. the maximium bytes per read operation quote (4096) has been exeeeded while reading xml data. This quote may be increased by changing the Maxbytesperread property on the xmldictionaryreaderquotas object used when creating the xml reader.</P>
<P>Is there a way to correct this?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, March 14, 2009</h2><P>The exception gives a pretty good indication of the issue. WCF has default limits on the size of data than can be transferred, and you've hit one of those limits. You need to change the WCF configuration as indicated, to raise the limits.</P>
<P>There are other posts on this topic in the forum (this is a fairly common thing), and of course any decent WCF book and much online WCF content should also be helpful.</P>
<P>Configuring WCF usually just involves adding a bunch of XML to the system.serviceModel elements of your client and server config files. The options for WCF are incredibly flexible, and include a great many max size, timeout and other values.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kyle.l.watson@gmail.com replied on Monday, March 16, 2009</h2><P>You're absolutely right. </P>
<P>In my case, you can set the readerquotas under the binding section on the client. The attribute "maxbytesperread" was adjusted in my case.</P>
