<P>Naturally, I headed here to get the latest csla for my first .net project after getting back! :)</P>
<P>But there seem to be different versions of CSLA to choose from, and I'm confused.</P>
<P>One, I'm not necessarily wanting to do silverlight, so CSLA for Silverlight doesn't seem the right choice.</P>
<P>Which version of CSLA do we use for .net web and windows application development?&nbsp; </P>
<P>The different CSLA versions for different front ends is a bit confusing, as I thought one of the design goals was to have the same business object code support multiple front ends...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, September 18, 2009</h2>Hi Dave, <br><br>Decide on what version of .Net&nbsp; to support and select the newest version of Csla for that runtime.<br><br>Csla 3.7.0 is the latest and recommended release for .Net 3.5 and includes helpers for Windows Forms, ASP.NET, WPF and Silverlight. <br><br>And I would also recommend to upgrade your projects as soon as new versions are released. <br><br>Csla for silverlight is a special version that will run in the Silverlight runtime and is "serializable" compatible with the corresponding version ordinary Csla.Net. Remember: Silverlight has only a subset of functionality compared to the .Net runtime - so Csla.Net for Windows will NOT compile for Silverlight. <br><br>If you are not going to do Silverlight then focus on Csla.Net for Windows and make sure to get the "Expert xx 2008 BusinessObject" book. <br><br>/jonnybee<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Friday, September 18, 2009</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>JonnyBee:</strong></div><div>...And I would also recommend to upgrade your projects as soon as new versions are released...<BR></div></BLOCKQUOTE></P>
<P>I'm not sure about this, especially if you aren't targeting the features in the new version. Within a particular major version, the patch updates can be valuable, but there have been significant changes between major CSLA versions in the 2 years I have been using it that have caused major application breakage (both obvious and subtle). I suggest that you need&nbsp;to coordinate a CSLA upgrade with a major regression test and probably new version of your own application. </P>
<P>To quote the old adage, "If it isn't broken, don't fix it."</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 18, 2009</h2><P>The challenge for all of us is that Silverlight is not just a different front end or UI technology - it has a different runtime. Sure, it looks a lot like .NET, but it is not quite the same...</P>
<P>This is much like the Compact Famework, which also looks like .NET but isn't (though Silverlight is a big enough subset to be wonderfully fun to use, unlike CF).</P>
<P>Of course it doesn't help that people are actively using several versions of .NET itself: 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5 SP1... They aren't completely interchangable either...</P>
<P>I rather suspect, however, that the pure 3.5 is about done - if you are 3.5, you are actually 3.5 SP1. So when I do the next release I'll probably remove CSLA .NET 3.5 from the "active" download area - so the options will basically be 1.5.3, 3.0.5 and 3.8.0.</P>
<P>That'll last for a very short period of time though, since .NET 4.0 is just around the corner - and it is a whole new runtime (unlike .NET 3.0 and 3.5, which build on the 2.0 core).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
