This is leading up to the 4.5.40 release that I expect to put up at the end of next week.</p>
<p>This release adds updated Android support using Xamarin.</p>
<p>This release also includes a whole ton of bug fixes and minor feature enhancements.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the current list of changes:</p>

<p>Please test this release ASAP and let us know if you encounter issues, as we&#39;re in the final week prior to release and obviously want to find/fix any major issues before release.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, September 06, 2013</h2><p>Do you anticipate 4.5.40 being released today then or will it more likely be next week? We&#39;ll be moving to that once it comes out as we&#39;re in the midst of a QA phase before release and will be able to run it through the ringers a good deal.&nbsp; There&#39;s a bug-fix we&#39;ll be upgrading for.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 06, 2013</h2><p>Probably over the weekend - that&#39;s my plan anyway.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, September 12, 2013</h2><p>May I please ask if there is any update on 4.5.40?&nbsp; (Sorry to ask again, we have pretty much one last TFS item currently for our next release and it revolves around 4.5.40).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance and I hope you are continuing to recover well.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, September 18, 2013</h2><p>Sadly I&#39;m not:(</p>
<p>I am back in the hospital, but am out of ICU now and might get home in the next few days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, immediately before I was rushed to the hospital the data drive in my workstation crashed and I&#39;d started a recovery process. I don&#39;t know if it worked, tough it had over a week to run at this point :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the release is ready to go as soon as I&#39;m well enough and have a working workstation.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, September 19, 2013</h2><p>I have already made a temporary change to get around my problem; rest and recover - thanks for taking a moment to let us all know.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
