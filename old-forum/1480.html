<P>First when a particular class is called the constructor is called.In the constructor i want to break the rules or i want to prevent direct creation.Or what i want is object should not to a valid object when i call it.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Friday, October 13, 2006</h2><P>Hi yh_ink,</P>
<P>I'm having trouble understanding what you want to do. Are you saying that you want your object to be invalid when it is created?</P>
<P>If so, what Andy said is correct. Call ValidatonRules.CheckRules() in&nbsp;DataPortal_Create.</P>
<P>An object is not valid if one of the rules is broken. So if all your rules are satisfied, it's valid. You'd have to break a rule to make it invalid.</P>
<P>I think it would help if you described your use case, or what you need to accomplish in general.</P>
<P>Regards,</P>
