After saving or moving to the next row&nbsp;forecolor should revert to the original color. I am thinking to inherit ftom BusinessBase and override PropertyHasChanged and save the property name in a list. In addition, to have some methods for clearing the list, check the list if contains a particular name. On the winform loop through the controls and check if the name is in the list and then change the color</P>
<P>Anybody implemented something like this and how was it done?</P>

You get to the other properties via the "Databinding / Advanced" button in the Properies windows of a control.<br><br>I've done this sort of thing by a BO having a property of type System.Drawing.Color. This is set within the BO to output the appropriate color. The control's backcolor or whatever is bound to that. That's worked fine although I'm aware that its somewhat "bad" because it introduces some UI stuff into the BO but ... it got the job done.<br><br>Ross<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
