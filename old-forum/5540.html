One of the fields is "Remarks".&nbsp; If it is a new object that is not being automatically generated remarks needs to be empty.&nbsp; If it's a generated one it needs to say "Computer Generated Writeup".<br><br>Would this still be done in the DP_Fetch?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Monday, October 06, 2008</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>How you manage the auto-generation depends on how you determine when it needs to be done, but I think the easiest method is to define a criteria class to pass into DP_Create that would contain the necessary information.&nbsp; If you need to go to the database, you can certainly do that in DP_Create, just like you would in DP_Fetch - in fact, that's&nbsp;part of the original intent of DP_Create.</FONT></P>
