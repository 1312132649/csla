If you have a custom architecture, using this guidance package you can build a custom code generator with your favorite technology.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Sculpture can generate any kind of text output using templates (source code, database scripts, web pages, XML, configuration files, etc.).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Sculpture takes you to the next level of abstraction by separating the problem from the implementation technology.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Sculpture takes you to the domain specific programming by adding your specifications to the model environment and the generated code.<br><br>Sculpture Home Page <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Sculpture">http://www.codeplex.com/Sculpture</a> (We provide 2<br>screencasts introducing Sculpture).<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
