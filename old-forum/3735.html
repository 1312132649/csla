<P>When we say that data-centric thinking is not good way to design business applications, what does 'data-centric' means?</P>
<P>In other words if I am thinking in 'X' way and&nbsp;designing my applications in 'Y' way&nbsp;then that is the data-centric way of doing things. What is 'X' and 'Y' here?</P>

<P>Many thanks for your reply.</P>
<P>I agree with you and I have started to realize that what people on this thread call data-centric approach is something I have done in past as well. It gets the application on its feet very quickly however very soon it falls apart due to maintenance problems. Most importantly, what has happened with me, is that it is difficult for the application to grow because the code is so mixed up (due to each class doing more than one task).</P>

<P>Would you be able to give me some sample code for the mapping of database and contents of objects?</P>
<P>I would really appreciate it.</P>
