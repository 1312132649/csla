<p>I have parent - child class relationship&nbsp;and there is sceanrio where I need to delete all child objects only (through referential integrity). Can someone please assist on this regard as I&#39;m new to CSLA and trying to understand the basics?</p>
<p>It would be great help to me&nbsp;if I can get some samples on how delete works in parent child relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you delete a child from a BusinessListBase collection, the object is moved to a DeletedList collection inside the main collection. When the collection is saved, your DAL is invoked to delete the items in the DeletedList, and then to insert/update any changed items in the main list.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
