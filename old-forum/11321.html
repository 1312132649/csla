I originally only purchased one book because I thought I didn&#39;t need the others. Turns out that the first book is a like gateway drug, and I couldn&#39;t stop until I got all of them. Word to the wise: shell out the $99 at the start, and you&#39;ll save yourself money, although truthfully I don&#39;t begrudge Rocky any of the money I&#39;ve spent.</p>
<p>In my opinion, your writing style is clear and concise. Grammatically, the books are close to flawless. They convey important information with as few words as necessary. You do a great job of explaining why you chose to do things the way you did. Your explanations of &quot;responsibility-driven and behavior-driven object-oriented design&quot; are very good, and I will be quoting them when I have the inevitable arguments that lie ahead of me (&#39;nuff said about that, sigh).</p>
<p>In short, your ebooks are such a joy to read, they&#39;re like a good novel series. Seriously. (OK, I admit that might be over the top, but that&#39;s the kind of guy I am.) I&#39;m reading them on my iPad using an app called &quot;iAnnotate PDF&quot; (which I <b>highly</b> recommend). This app lets me highlight words and paragraphs, and I&#39;ve highlighted so much of the books that I&#39;ve had to come up with a color and icon scheme to keep them organized.</p>
<p>Truly great stuff. Thanks for the effort.</p>
<p>PS: I don&#39;t know what your final decision was on the WinForms book - I just noticed you had a poll. Here&#39;s my vote for a WinForms book, and perhaps it could include a section on converting from v3.8x to current (or maybe that require an entire book on its own)? Just a thought. Thanks again!!!!</p>

The newer books also let him release updated content and fixes so they are pretty much flawless. A must have for any CSLA Developer.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
