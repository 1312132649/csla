<P>I am using VS 2008 B2 with a Windows Forms C# Project.&nbsp; I have a ReadWrite List.&nbsp; In the WinForm everytime I try this:</P>
<P>MyList _list = SomeGetListFunction();</P>
<P>//make some changes</P>
<P>//HERE IS THE FAILURE</P>
<P>_list.Save( //As soon as I type the first '(' VS crashes to the desktop!</P>
<P>Does anyone know anything about this?</P>
<P>I opened the project in VS 2005 and it works fine.</P>
<P>By the way Rocky, for the first time since VS Live was in Vegas, I am going to miss it this year.&nbsp; You guys have a great time and I will see you there next year I hope........&nbsp; Its even at the Rio again......&nbsp; If any of you are thinking of taking one of his workshops I HIGHLY recommend them.&nbsp; I went last year and it was great &lt;shameless plug&gt;.</P>

<P>Noticed you weren't speaking at VSLive Austin.&nbsp; I thought I might catch you there since I am going to miss Vegas.&nbsp; What other conference do you recommend for WPF?&nbsp; </P>
<P>I really enjoyed your workshop and learned a great deal.</P>
<P>Thanks.&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, August 23, 2007</h2>






 





<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I think you&#8217;ll see all the major conferences rapidly
introduce WPF content: VS Live and Dev Connections being the primaries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>But it is a challenge. It isn&#8217;t like Windows Forms,
ASP.NET or AJAX went away with the introduction of WPF and Silverlight. Yet the
conferences can&#8217;t arbitrarily add sessions or tracks without adding proportionally
more attendees. Catch-22.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So the WPF and Silverlight content pretty much comes at the cost
of WinForms or ASP.NET content, at least in the short term&#8230; At least that&#8217;s
my guess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Rocky<o:p></o:p></span></p>
