<P>Do you have two separate BOs for this, or do you make an editable BO that can "change" to read only?&nbsp; I have seen a few threads on here and understand how to implement a "switchable" read only/editable object, but I am wondering from a "correct" standpoint if it is better to have two different BOs?&nbsp; The purist in me seems to think that one editable object for entry and one read-only object is the way to go, but the time-saver and re-user in me thinks that a hybrid is the easiest way to go about it.</P>
<P>Thoughts?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, September 15, 2008</h2><P>A lot of people use authorization to solve this - overriding CanWriteProperty() so it always returns false when IsNew is false, otherwise returning the security-based value.</P>
<P>I think that's a fine thing. You could argue that the user is only authorized to edit values of a new object, and that they are not authorized to edit values of an existing object.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Wbmstrmjb replied on Monday, September 15, 2008</h2><P>As long as it is not a big CSLA no-no, I am going to try that route.&nbsp; Thanks Rocky.</P>
<P>I'm thinking however, of implementing it with a readonly flag in the base class and a MarkReadOnly() function with the CanWriteProperty override&nbsp;so that classes don't have to override CanWriteProperty each time I need a "switchable" class.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
