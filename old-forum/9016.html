<p>Mostly I use locally instantiated objects but I have some cases where I need a specific instance to be instantiated remotely. This is usually performance, etc. related. When I do this at the moment I simply activate the objects myself via a config.</p>
<p>But what I was wondering is if there is any pattern out there for tweaking which objects, in which scenarios get instantiated locally and which remotely.</p>
<p>My understanding of clsa is that you choose one or the other - either the entire business layer is instantiated remotely or it is instantiated locally (leaving the [runlocal] attribute out to avoid confusion). I admit my understanding may be very dated.</p>
<p>Thank you</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>There&#39;s an entry in the FAQ about having multiple configurations for the data portal</p>

<p>That should answer your question.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jh72i replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Rocky. It certainly answers part of.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>I did something just like this that required a slight modification of CSLA. Basically, CSLA is already designed to let you force methods to run locally even when using a remote portal, so it was fairly simple to extend this to allow operations on entire classes to be forced locally. </p>
<p>The details (and code) are in this thread: <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/6085/29512.aspx#29512">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/6085/29512.aspx#29512</a></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>I think you can do that force-local thing now using an IDataPortalProxyFactory implementation - avoiding the need to alter CSLA.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jh72i replied on Wednesday, June 02, 2010</h2><p>Again, thanks for taking time out to respond. I&#39;m happy now that a solution is achievable and that the idea isn&#39;t a no-no. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Wednesday, June 02, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b>
<p>I think you can do that force-local thing now using an IDataPortalProxyFactory implementation - avoiding the need to alter CSLA.</p>

</div></p>
<p>Is this new&nbsp;in CSLA 4.0? I see IDataPortalProxy in 3.8 but not IDataPortalProxyFactory. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 02, 2010</h2><p>It might be new in CSLA 4 - good point.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
