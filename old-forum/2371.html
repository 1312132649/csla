<P>However, as soon as i build the service installation and install the service, the service creates a queue name of "SPMSV2batchqueue"</P>
<P>I have searched in every solution that even remotly has anything to do with this and have come up with nothing. </P>
<P>I have the service working fine, i just changed the app.config files to match the queue name that the service made. but this is really bothering me.</P>
<P>Has anybody ever seen something like this before? If so how did you fix it?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
