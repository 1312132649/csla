<p>I haven&#39;t delved deeply into the blog posts about CSLA 4 features&nbsp;but I get the sense that there are more breaking changes than most other releases as well as substantially revamped subsystems such as the business rules subsystem.</p>
<p>So one question - is there a recording of the CSLA 4 session that we can watch?</p>
<p>And the other question - are the blog posts the best summarization of the forthcoming changes or is there going to be some sort of e-book/video/etc as a supplementary offering later on?</p>
<p>Blog Posts as mentioned in the main CSLA 4 Preview thread are here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4DataPortalChanges.aspx"><span style="color:#3366cc;">Changes to the data portal</span></a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4BusinessRulesSubsystem.aspx"><span style="color:#3366cc;">The new business and validation rules system</span></a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I&#39;m also considering the idea of an &quot;online conference&quot; - where people would literally attend a set of live online presentations, with some time at the end of each for&nbsp;questions,&nbsp;about CSLA 4. What do you all think of that idea?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>skagen00 replied on Wednesday, April 14, 2010</h2><p>I think an online conference is a fantasic idea.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jack replied on Wednesday, April 14, 2010</h2><p>Fantastic idea ... maybe with a week in advance to send in questions of which the most pertinent could be used as the basic agenda.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hayrob replied on Thursday, April 15, 2010</h2><p>Rocky</p>
<p>I love Csla!</p>
<p>There is a split emerging between those who can aford to purchase the video training and those of us who cannot and who depend on books/ebooks. This split is exacerbated by the need to shell out lots of dosh on VS2010 (and in my case Resharper) to get going on Csla4.</p>
<p>So my plea is that the priority is an ebook!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>KevinKlasman replied on Thursday, April 15, 2010</h2><p>Here&#39;s another vote for the online conference. The other content would be great as well.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Imker replied on Friday, April 16, 2010</h2><p>Online Conference is a great idea. I read the forum and blogs on a daily basis to learn</p>
<p>more about CSLA. I often use a forum question to test and enhance my understanding</p>
<p>of the book chapters. &nbsp;But please, record the conference and make it available for later</p>
<p>reference and learning pleasure. And of course... for the sake of users in different time zones</p>
<p>around the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, April 16, 2010</h2><p>Yes, the global/time issue is a challenge. Recording the sessions is a good option. Another option is to do a series of perhaps 2-3 conferences at different times.</p>
<p>If I do this early in the morning (for me) I can get central and east US and Europe/UK all at once (morning in the US, afternoon in Europe/UK).</p>
<p>I think that if I do a late evening I can get east Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>India&nbsp;is the biggest challenge, because I think to get India I&#39;d have to do the event in the middle of my night <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-7.gif" alt="Tongue Tied" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>johntco replied on Friday, April 16, 2010</h2><p>When is 4.0 anticipated to be completed?</p>
<p>Is the &quot;4.0.0 Preview 2&quot; completed enough so that I can use it to begin a project? I just purchased VS2010 and want to get started soon on a Web development project. If I create my business objects against Preview 2, will they need code changes, or just a rebuild, when 4.0 Final Release is completed?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, April 16, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>John Cohoon<br></b>
<p>When is 4.0 anticipated to be completed?</p>
</p>
<p></div></p>
<p>I hope to start the beta process within the next couple weeks. There are just two things that need to be finished: the authorization rules update and implementing INotifyDataErrorInfo on SL (which isn&#39;t hard fortunately).</p>
<p>Once the beta process starts it is usually 4-8 weeks to completion, depending on the feedback during the beta process.</p>

<p>No, absolutely not. I wouldn&#39;t build anything serious using the preview releases. They are pre-beta. I put them out to solicit input.</p>
<p>Every time I do a release someone comes along months later and says &quot;why didn&#39;t you do X?&quot;. The answer is often that I didn&#39;t think of X, and if that person had participated in the pre-release process they could have suggested X when it was actually possible to act on the suggestion. </p>
<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean the pre-releases are stable or consistent or should be used for serious work.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Friday, April 16, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b></p>

<p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that there are a bunch of other recording you have done in the past, I know I listen to one about MVVM (pretty good) and I think I also saw you in one of the VS 2010 launch events videos.</p>
<p>Anyway, not sure if you done this already or not, but I think it would be pretty nice if you had a page with links pointing to presentations (voice/video) that you have done in the past.</p>
<p>By the way, I am still patiently waiting for the MVVM video you promised us!!!! <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>Something that would be beneficial to me is pointing out examples where the framework now , will, or could takes advantage of new .net 4.0 features (PLINQ, etc.).&nbsp; I&#39;m sure many others besides myself use the framework as examples of best practicies as well as standards.&nbsp; I&#39;ve learned so much from digging through the code and seeing how other people do things.&nbsp; It is pretty massive though so having some bookmarks of where to look would be great.</p>
<p>Just a thought...</p>
