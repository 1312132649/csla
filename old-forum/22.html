I have tried it on all 3 skins and it's the same. If anyone can change it that would be cool as I like to use that navigation to get back to the forum index after reading a thread.</P>

<P>I noticed the same, but if i scroll down and then scroll back up the breadcrumb links appear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Also while i'm editing this I can see the breadcrumbs</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mark replied on Monday, May 08, 2006</h2><P>Hmm...I didn't even notice the bread crumbs until I saw this thread..&nbsp; I'd just been seeing white space - but sure enough, if I highlight the area, the bread crumbs appear.&nbsp; Paging down/up doesn't fix the issue for me, though.&nbsp; </P>
<P>That said, I can see them as I'm typing this message...</P>
<P>One other annoyance - I always have to manually login, even though I've checked the box that says 'Remember me next time'.&nbsp; Anyone else seeing that?</P>

<P>However, the issue with the breadcrumbs has been resolved. I was using div tags to display some header information, and I've now wrapped them in a single-row, single-column table, thus apparently convincing IE to contain them rather than letting them overwrite the breadcrumb control.</P>
<P>Have I ever mentioned how much I hate html? It is like the special format codes from word processors of 20 years ago, but more complex and less predictable...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Monday, May 08, 2006</h2><P>This forum is still 110% better that the msn forum though.&nbsp; :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeWork replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2><P>Thanks for you help on this admin much appreciated</P>

Are other people successfully receiving posts via email? I've tried two accounts and four unrelated email addresses without luck. I'm subscribed to the forum where it says "Email Available". There is also another radio button choice in my profile which has something to do with email notifications. That is set to Yes. Have I missed anything?<br><br>I've let Rocky know but it seems to be working for others so .... its really wierd.<br><br>Cheers<br>Ross<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jan replied on Friday, May 12, 2006</h2><P>Ross,</P>
<P>Same problem here : Whatever I try, I do not get any e-mail from this forum.</P>
<P>Anyone having more success with the e-mail feature ?</P>

Its not just forum posts, no email from the site works for me at all. Yesterday I thought I'd try one more time and signed up a third account using my work address which I usually keep away from mailing lists etc. Still nothing, not even the welcome message. I got the welcome message for the account I signed up when Rocky first announced it but that's the only email I've ever received from here. If I go to one of my posts and try "Contact tetranz by email" I receive nothing.<br><br>Its not a real big issue for me right now, I can use the web forum, but Rocky, when you get back I think someone needs to do some tests and look at the logs or something. My tests have convinced me that its more than just something odd with one domain or network path.<br><br>Cheers<br>Ross<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, May 12, 2006</h2>I agree - the email has stopped working. I'll have to check the email service logs to see what's going on.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, May 12, 2006</h2><P>It appears that the CS 2.0 email gateway is a bit fragile. It failed to contact the email server on 6 May and that failure caused the email service to shut down. I wouldn't think a socket error should bring down the whole service - that happens fairly frequently - but that seems to be what happened.</P>
<P>So everyone should be getting tons of email now - CS 2.0 queues the messages until they can go out. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeWork replied on Monday, May 15, 2006</h2><P>I have added a post to the new Forum Administration area concearning the "Remember Me" issue as I resolved it on my own site with help from CS</P>
