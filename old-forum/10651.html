<p>Is there a road-map available and any major new thing in the works for CSLA other than the latest stuff which seems to be porting to other platforms?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, August 29, 2011</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Quite a number of bugfixes and enhancements to the rule engine is coming in 4.2</p>
<p>I just published a blog post on the major enhancements on the rule engine.<br /><a href="http://jonnybekkum.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/csla-4-2-rules-update/">http://jonnybekkum.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/csla-4-2-rules-update/</a> </p>
<p>I intend to follow up with more posts related to the RuleTutorial sample (in Csla trunk) and different types of rules that you will write. <br />These rules with additional rules is also published at <a href="http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com">CslaGenFork </a>by Tiago.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Monday, August 29, 2011</h2><p>Ahh...thanks Johnny.</p>
<p>I missed that rules engine stuff.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So we should absolutely be using 4.2 if we&#39;re starting development on something big then?</p>
<p>Is there a guide for updating from 4.1 to 4.2 or is it just replace and go?</p>
<p>Is any of this stuff on a time frame we can look at (roadmap)?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, August 29, 2011</h2><p>Moving from 4.1 to 4.2 is basically just replace and go but you will be able to create more generic/reusable rules and get better control on when rules is allowed to run. I also like to possibility to override the MessageText when a client/spec says that there should be a specific message.</p>
<p>I have also made some bugfixes to Csla.Xaml.PropertyStatus that may be important for you. </p>
<p>I already have a big project using Csla 4.2 (latest from trunk) and it gives me valuable feedback in testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 29, 2011</h2><p>A great deal depends on what Microsoft announces or shows at their BUILD conference in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Thus far the only hints they&#39;ve dropped about Windows 8 development have focused on HTML 5, JavaScript, and perhaps some C++. They did say the Silverlight plug-in will run in IE10 (and thus on Win8), and that existing apps (presumably C++/COM and .NET) will run in the Win8 &quot;legacy mode&quot;.</p>
<p>The only known quantities right now are Silverlight 5 and Windows Phone &quot;Mango&quot; (sometimes called 7.5).</p>
<p>My current plan is that CSLA 4 version 4.2 will support &quot;Mango&quot;, because that&#39;s been released. </p>
<p>SL5 still has no official release date, so it is hard to say when I will directly support it.</p>
<p>There&#39;s been no word from Redmond about .NET &quot;v.next&quot; - whether that be 4.5 or 5. Hopefully BUILD will have lots of .NET v.next content - but they are being so secretive that even the BUILD agenda isn&#39;t known.</p>
<p>Because of the secrecy around Win8 development and the future of .NET, it is impossible for me to provide a meaningful roadmap for CSLA. All I can say is that if .NET continues as a vibrant n-tier platform, CSLA .NET will evolve with .NET, Silverlight, and Windows Phone.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 29, 2011</h2><p>The roadmap, such as it is, is always here: <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/roadmap.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/roadmap.aspx</a></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Monday, August 29, 2011</h2><p>Ahhhh....yes of course the infamous Build and windows 8 situation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I too am awaiting that which is why I&#39;m working hard on *backend* CSLA based stuff right now because I was assuming that wouldn&#39;t change much depending on what&#39;s announced and the front end is much more up in the air now.</p>
<p>Maybe I should just say &quot;screw it&quot; and go back on holidays for another month until the dust clears! :)</p>
