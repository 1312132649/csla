<p>If the list is the root, then you have to handle the CollectionChanged event in the list class itself, which is fine.</p>
<p>Either way, you need to hook the event in a safe manner. You might think to use the parent&#39;s constructor, but that isn&#39;t really safe because of differences between .NET and SL serialization.</p>
<p>The safe approach is to do it in two places: Initialize and OnDeserialized.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Tuesday, February 15, 2011</h2><p>That worked!&nbsp; I was wondering where to hook in for this.&nbsp; Intialize and OnDeserialized worked.&nbsp; Thanks!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
