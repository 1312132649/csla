<p>Removing a pre-exisiting item from a DynamicListBase results in deleting and saving the item. However, the item is only removed from the collection if it is new? I&#39;m just using it in code without binding to a grid.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, August 18, 2010</h2><p>The behavior you describe is correct. If IsNew=false then there&#39;s something to delete, so it is deleted. If IsNew=true then there&#39;s nothing to delete so the item is just removed from the collection.</p>
<p>The definition of IsNew is very simple: If true, to the best of our knowledge there&#39;s data in the data store corresponding to the object. If false, to the best of our knowledge there is no data in the data store corresponding to the object.</p>
<p>All editable CSLA objects are designed around that definition of IsNew.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Wednesday, August 18, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b> If true, to the best of our knowledge there&#39;s data in the data store corresponding to the object.

<p>Rocky,<br />Shouldn&#39;t it be the other way round.&nbsp; IsNew when there is no data in DB corresponding to the object.</p>
<p>Welcome back.&nbsp; We were wondering where you were.&nbsp; We knew it wasn&#39;t a vacation, because you just can&#39;t resist peeking in here even when you are on vacation.&nbsp; Someone said, &quot;Argentina may be!&quot;.&nbsp; I said, &quot;No, No, No Way, Not Rocky!&quot;&nbsp;<img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" />&nbsp;&nbsp; The forum was beginning to look like every other forum that is out there - abundance of questions, paucity of answers.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, August 18, 2010</h2><p>Yeah, I got it backward and forward all in the same post.</p>
<p>I am on vacation - in far north Minnesota where I only sporadically get cell service at all, much less data service. About 1-2 times a day I&#39;ve been driving to the top of a hill or even into a nearby town to get enough cell service to get online.</p>
<p>But the fishing is excellent, and that&#39;s what really matters! :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dmnc replied on Thursday, August 19, 2010</h2><p>I figured out that the save/update in DynamicListBase is now asynchronous. That&#39;s the reason why the following didn&#39;t work for me anymore:</p>
<p>var products = Products.GetProducts();<br />products.Remove(products.First());<br />products.Remove(products.First());</p>
<p>Enjoy your remaining vacation days!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
