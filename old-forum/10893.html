<p>When deployed the UI shows no exceptions (when non-group user tries to&nbsp;edit)&nbsp;which is what I want since the user just needs to not be able to change the field - I don&#39;t want errors.</p>
<p>The question is, since the error is obviously being thrown in the background and is left unhandled&nbsp;in&nbsp;deployment&nbsp;this a problem when the Silverlight application is deployed?&nbsp; There are no apparent problems but I wonder if I&#39;m creating chaos for my application in the background.&nbsp; Should I be avoiding the error altogether?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
