<P>I am getting my feet wet with CSLA code for the first time. I have PTracker working with Winforms (PTWIN) local proxy only. Now I am trying to determine the best way to use the CSLA framework for my authentication model. </P>
<P>I would like to use Windows authentication but want&nbsp;the users to be prompted&nbsp;again with their Windows login and password.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to use my own application database roles for authorization, not Windows groups. </P>
<P>Assuming this is this possible with CSLA, can someone please provide some advice on the cleanest way to get this done? </P>
<P>As a start I know I will have to change the app.config CslaAuthentication setting: <FONT color=#0000ff size=2>&lt;</FONT><FONT color=#a31515 size=2>add</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2> </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>key</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>=</FONT><FONT size=2>"</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>CslaAuthentication</FONT><FONT size=2>"</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2> </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>value</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>=</FONT><FONT size=2>"Windows</FONT><FONT size=2>"</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2> /&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=3><FONT color=#000000> which I have done but this disables the login screen. </FONT></P></FONT></FONT>

<P>I made some changes to PTracker authentication in order to have Windows Authentication. In fact you just need to change CslaAuthentication attribute. The nicest thing about it is that you can have both at the same time.</P>
<P>If the users that is authenticated under Windows exists in the <FONT face="Courier New" color=#800080 size=2>users</FONT> table, it gets logged on with no further questions. Otherwise (the windows user name doesn't exist in the <FONT face="Courier New" color=#800080 size=2>users</FONT> table) the login window will ask for username/password. This is quite useful when you have an application on a client but your laptop is not in the client's domain. You can still use your laptop and login in the application using the application admin username.</P>

<P>Its really ammazing how many different ways we have found to implement different authentication methods.</P>

<P>I ended up using LDAP to authenticate the userid/password. Then I take this&nbsp;userid and build the CSLA principle and identity objects.&nbsp; I have a connection string containing a totally different userid and password which is granted execute access to stored procedures only. </P>
<P>The last piece I need to build is to encrypt the connection string in the app.config file. This is a challenge because my app is&nbsp;clickonce forms which means that I need to use a non-machine dependent method of encrypting the app.config.&nbsp; I am looking at a solution like this one: </P>
