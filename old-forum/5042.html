<p class=MsoNormal><span>I would use FilteredBindingList.&nbsp; To Csla List
FilteredBindingList is what DataView is to DataTable.&nbsp; Everything is
stored in the BusinesList but subset is accessible form the
FilteredBindingList.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Moreover, the same way you specify predicates for FindAll, you
can specify custom filter criteria in your implementation of
FilteredBindingList;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
