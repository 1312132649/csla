I was hoping to do this while I was upgrading the app. As I recall, 1.1 cache's the remoting connection. If the 2.0.2 version then tries to open another, this is creating this cituation. Is that correct? Is there a way around it? I guess I could use the web service interface without issue couldn't I (I haven't tested that yet)? Any input would be greatly appreciated......</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pelinville replied on Tuesday, July 04, 2006</h2><DIV>Actually it is something within the .NET framework.&nbsp; I don't claim to understand it fully but once you have registered a channel it cannot be registered again.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What I do is check to see if the channel has been registered and if not then register it.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Just because it is registered doesn't mean you can't use multiple remoted objects from varios servers.&nbsp;</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Misled replied on Wednesday, July 05, 2006</h2>How would I access that channel that is open in the 1.1 version of CSLA &nbsp;from 2.0.2 version of CSLA.
