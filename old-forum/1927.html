For some reason I'm thinking just the core assembly project needs the reference.&nbsp; Am I wrong?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pelinville replied on Friday, December 08, 2006</h2><DIV>We had a problem simular to this. A particular assembly/class could not load.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We solved it by uninstalling both .net 1.1 and .net 2 then re-installing both after making sure sp2 was installed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Never really knew what the problem was but in a couple of cases .net 2 was installed before 1.1.&nbsp;And it might have to do with the service packs being installed also.</DIV>
