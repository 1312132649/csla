The BB child object is bound to a DataGrid (updated DataGrid as of 12/18/2008).  One of the columns in the DataGrid is a combo box (similar to the Rolodex sample).  The combox box is bound to a NameValueListBase object that populates the selectable values and that seems to work fine.  I'm using a helper converter class to get the value (key) of the selected combo item.  This also works correctly.  My issue is on a Save .. if I don't click in the actual cell where my combo box is housed, I get the following error: 'Edit level mismatch in AcceptChanges'.<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas on this?  I've noticed this behavior is consistent in the Rolodex sample as well.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />SMIMS</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
