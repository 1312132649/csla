<p>The main question is why each time it becomes harder and harder of upgrading project to use newer version of csla.</p>
<p>My project is running under csla 4.5.10 and .net framework 4 CP.</p>
<p>Right now I&#39;m trying to upgrade it to use csla 4.5.20 because, I suppose the problem with asyncrhonious running of BeginFetch is resolved.</p>
<p>I have about 11 projects in solution the references Csla, and that&#39;s not enough to add only Csla library to the each project. I also need at least add: System.Runtime and System.Threading.Tasks that coming with Microsoft.Bd.Async package.</p>
<p>My question is how can I do it faster without wasting a lot of time trying to unserstand what I need to add to References to be able to lunch the application epsecially if I&#39;m using installation package and I don&#39;t want to spend time to investigate source code of Csla?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why each new version of Csla becomes more harder for upgrading...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the error what I&#39;m receiving:</p>

<p>Not only for Csla. but for all my project that are referenced by Main Project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>kmavis replied on Thursday, March 21, 2013</h2><p>I ran into the same thing. I discovered that NuGet was creating an app.config in each project that &quot;redirects&quot; the version number for those two dlls.. But that app.config was not added to the project. Once I manually added that new app.config to the project I was able to get it to build.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
