I'm trying the Linq option as put in the BO 2008 book.<br><br>I understand the AgGrid has a way to determine the sorted columns, something like AgGrid_SortingChanged event and "AgGrid.SortedColumns[index].SortOrder" and so, but couldn't find this in the Ms datagrid, and i would like to use Ms because CSLA it plays better with it (less lines of code).<br><br>How are you dealing with this? Any ideas/piece of code is greatly appreciated.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
