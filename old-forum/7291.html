<p class=MsoNormal><span>Yep,
we found this issue and submitted it to Telerik a few weeks ago.&nbsp; They
fixed one of the problems in last Friday&#8217;s release, and admitted to
having another one.&nbsp; They said they will have it fixed at some point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is anybody using Telerik's radGrid for SL2 and experiencing
EditLevel issues when trying to save ChildLists?&nbsp; I swapped from the
standard MS datagrid to their grid in a few spots and I'm suddenly having
issues saving.<br>
<br>
I'm seeing the following behavior:&nbsp; <br>
<br>
1) click on a column twice to select column and then enter edit mode<br>
2) I can see the call to&nbsp;IEditableObject.BeginEdit() (valid/expected)<br>
3) I change my value<br>
4) I click on a different row and IEditableObject.AcceptEdit() (valid/expected)<br>
5) Immediately though IEditableObject.BeginEdit() fires on the same row (not
expected)<br>
<br>
The second call leaves my child EditLevel at 2 while everything else is still
at 1<br>
<br>
I'm also not seeing the calls to CancelEdit() if I don't make the change in
step 3 although the BeginEdit does not fire a second time.<br>
<br>
I can get around all that by using the DisableIEditable flag but it is a bit of
a pain and it seems that the normal datagrid is working fine.<br>
<br>
I have logged a ticket with them but just an FYI for anybody struggling or if
someone has seen and gotten around that.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
