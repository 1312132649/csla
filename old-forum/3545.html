In particular, I am wondering which parts may be complimentary (for example, Logging Application Block, Exception Handling Application Block, etc.) and which may be duplicative (for example, the Security Application Block, Validation Application Block.)</P>
<P>IOW, is there a way to blend these two in order to maximize the best of both?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>William replied on Saturday, September 15, 2007</h2>There are a number of discussions on this topic in the forum. Just start searching will find.

Besides, Rocky also posted an article on the topic.
