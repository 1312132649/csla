<p>I think the issue is that when a row (item is added to the collection) is added by clicking the Add New, the edit level of that object is set to 1. When we double click a cell on the row to activate the cell/row, the edit level goes up to 2. Now, when we try to cancel, the edit level of the parent collection is 1 and that of the child item is 2 and hence boom.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have downloaded the ebook sample project tracker silverlight application.I get an Edit level mismatch exception on following the below steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the &quot;Edit roles&quot; menu option.</li>
<li>Click Add New.</li>
<li>Double click on the Name column of the newly added row. You should see the validation message pop up. </li>
<li>Click Cancel and an UndoException is thrown at UndoableBase.cs in the UndoChanges method.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m having the same issue in our line of business application. I&#39;ve followed some suggestions mentioned in earlier posts to set the ManageObjectLifetime to false. But, this has not helped.</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered this? Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
