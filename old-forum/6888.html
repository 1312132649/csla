It is used to display nice verbiage for broken rules.<br /><br />Rather than say "acctcode is required" it could say "Account code is required."<br /><br />Once it is defined, *leveraging* it for use in the UI is another question. I have not gone down that road myself. Maybe others have some input.<br /><br />Joe</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Friday, May 01, 2009</h2>[Bangs head against desk]... I'm an idiot, yes of course that's where it's used.&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>I'd be interested to here if anyone has managed to wire it up to a winforms UI though?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, May 01, 2009</h2><P>If you are using 3.6 there are a couple things you might consider.</P>
<P>One is to make your PropertyInfo&lt;T&gt; fields public instead of private. That more closely follows the dependency property model of WPF/WF, and the result is that the UI can leverage the metadata in those fields (including the friendly name).</P>
<P>Another is to expose the FieldManager.GetRegisteredProperties() data to the UI though a public method. CSLA doesn't make this public by default to avoid cluttering the public interface, but there's no reason you couldn't create a public method that delegated to this non-public method.</P>
<P>Again, the result is that you'd allow the UI to use the metadata in the PropertyInfo&lt;T&gt; objects.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, May 04, 2009</h2>Hi, <br><br>And for applications running in more than one locale (language) you should put FriendlyName into a resource file so you can translate the friendly name for each locale. <br><br>/jonnybee<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Tuesday, May 05, 2009</h2>@Rocky:&nbsp; Thanks Rocky, that's useful info and yep I'm on 3.6.2.&nbsp; Is there anyway you know of to automate getting the FriendlyNames into say grid column headers, or is it a case of manually coding it all?<br><br>@JonnyBee, thank you, that's good advice.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 05, 2009</h2>
