<P>I have a read only root list that I use for lookups. The list contains images, so it's kinda large and noticeably slow pulling across the network. The list rarely changes.</P>
<P>Is there anything wrong with changing my class so it's like a NameValueList? That is, have an instance variable of the same type as the class, and in the public static Get method, populate it if it's null, otherwise just re-use it?</P>
<P>Seems to me that would be ok, but I've made lots of mistakes due to ignorance, so I thought I'd ask.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

You can follow the pattern I used in RoleList to do the cache, and to provide a way to invalidate that cache if needed.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Wednesday, July 19, 2006</h2><P>Brian and Rocky,</P>
<P>Thanks for verifying. I'll make an InvalidateCache() method that sets the instance variable to null in case it's&nbsp;ever needed. The list changes so infrequently (every couple months or so), I can probably get away with just re-launching the app.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>Sounds like what you might need!</P>
<P>Haven't tried it yet - so maybe it doesn't work or I mis-read that section. :)&nbsp; I'm a couple of weeks away from trying that in my own project...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Thursday, July 20, 2006</h2><P>Interesting, I don't recall reading that. Can you point me to a reference?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>"Because of the unsealing of the <EM>CacheDependency</EM> class, the ASP.NET team has built a new SQL Server cache dependency -- <EM>SqlCacheDependency</EM>.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; When a cache becomes invalid because a table changes within the underlying SQL Server, you now know it immediately."</P>
<P>p. 756 and following describe the <EM>SqlCacheDepency</EM>&nbsp;usage.</P>
<P>Keep us posted on how it works!&nbsp; (And any gotchas you run into.)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Thursday, July 20, 2006</h2><P>Thanks David,</P>
<P>I'll have to read up on that. I'm working on a Windows Forms project right now, so not sure if I could use it, but it sounds cool.</P>
