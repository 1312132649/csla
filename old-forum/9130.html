The model ask for which business object (ie customer, vendor, auditor) and which record (ie the guid of the record).</p>
<p>I am now trying to implement the Get function. I was hoping to use the property that hold the business object name and then find the business object and load the record without using select case, but I can&#39;t figure out how to do it and if that is the best option.</p>
<p>Anyone have any idea if I can, how, or recommendations to do this?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>brannos replied on Wednesday, June 30, 2010</h2><p>Can someone please guide me on this. I am in desperate need to get this figured out.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 30, 2010</h2><p>Do you want to use the CSLA authorization features to do this? They rely on access to the current principal object (Csla.ApplicationContext.User) and its IsInRole() method. </p>
