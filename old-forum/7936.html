<P>I guess I've never tried this until today, and it turns out to not work... Which is strange, since it works fine with the Silverlight DataGrid and I thought they were similar - but apparently not.</P>
<P>Not only doesn't the DataGrid make proper IEditableObject calls, it also doesn't recognize that an item in the collection has been changed (based on the ListChanged event) and so maintains a reference to incorrect child objects as the user interacts with the data.</P>
<P>From what I can see the WPF DataGrid looks pretty broken - or am I missing something?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bartol replied on Tuesday, November 03, 2009</h2>I also tried it a few months ago and dropped it for the same reason in favour of Xceed's datagrid that works just fine with Csla's lists.<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 03, 2009</h2><P>I'm just surprised at how poor the WPF control is compared to its Silverlight counterpart.

<P>But I'm pleased to hear that the third party component vendors are doing good work in this area :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JasonBock replied on Thursday, November 05, 2009</h2><P>Has anybody else has success with 3rd-party data grids with ERLB? We're running into the same issues with the Toolkit DataGrid and we're looking at replacing the grid (along with getting other controls like the ribbon and docking controls). SyncFusion seems to have what we need but we haven't tried their stuff yet. Any other success stories?</P>
<P>Regards,</P>

I recently found a blog discussing the use of the DataGrid.RowEditEnding method and the DataGrid.CommandManager.PreviewExecuted (http://blogs.u2u.be/diederik/post/2009/10/28/Inserting-Updating-and-Deleting-from-a-WPF-DataGrid.aspx) and was hoping to see if I could create a workaround. Alternatively, I was considering putting time into testing the WPF4 beta to see if the DataGrid is "fixed" or researching 3rd party data grid controls.<br /><br />Russ</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
