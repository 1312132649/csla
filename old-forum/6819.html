I find it odd that it works both ways ... could be from a lack of understanding on my part.<br /><br />Also, is it necessary... or beneficial to have the same attribute wrap a Fetch?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, April 20, 2009</h2>That attribute won't have any effect on Child_xyz methods... only the DataPortal_XYZ methods will honor it.<br /><br />Fetches don't usually need transactions, as I think by default you won't read dirty data.  So as long as you haven't changed your locking type, I'd think it'd be fine.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>raz0rf1sh replied on Monday, April 20, 2009</h2>Thank you!
