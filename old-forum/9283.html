<p>And guess what i have done this. and the exception was that i have to create a instance of a object &quot;that i have to use the &#39;new&#39; KeyWord in order to get this work&quot; but i have no idea where i have to put in this &#39;new keyword&#39;, and as i mention before is that when i change the name of my data binding&nbsp;source to another source (class(eg instead of Account i use Customer))&nbsp;everything works fine, </p>
<p>More than&nbsp;this is that this is that this pecific&nbsp;class was used already used&nbsp;in a other project and i didn`t have any problems with it (i didn&#39;t made any changes to this when i switch it to this project only in the child fetch or save which wasn&#39;t used yet)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
