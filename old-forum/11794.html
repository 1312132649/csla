<p>I have been using CSLA 3 for quite a while (started off with c# 2005 Business Objects) and it is now time for me to move on with the times and dive into the new CSLA 4.5.</p>
<p>It looks like the current eBooks are for CSLA 4.0. My question is will the &quot;Using CSLA 4 eBooks&quot; be enough to get me going with CSLA 4.5 with prior knowledge of CSLA 3.0?</p>
<p>Are there any interesting features of 4.5 that won&#39;t be explained in the eBook series i.e. async/await?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have previously used CSLA 3 in a WinForm environment, but plan to start a new project with CSLA 4.5, MVC and Azure.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, January 17, 2013</h2><p>I would defnitely be interested as well, as&nbsp;I&#39;ll probably be bringing on a few new hires &amp; we use CSLA 4.5.&nbsp; I think the good thing is that the CSLA 4 books will have the new business rules engine, which (in my mind) was one of the biggest breaking change that I&#39;ve gone through with CSLA (started with 2.x).</p>
<p>Async/await like you say is certainly a fairly big adjustment though we haven&#39;t really started using those concepts in our code (almost for a consistency issue at this point).</p>
<p>I used to have ask my new hires read through the Expert Business Objects book but the&nbsp;2008 copy&nbsp;is definitely getting a little too out-of-date for my taste now that we&#39;re on 4.5&nbsp;(for teaching new hires).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, January 20, 2013</h2><p>The &quot;Using CSLA 4&quot; ebooks is applicable to CSLA 4.5 - and I would also recommend to read through all the ChangeLog documents. </p>
<p>Over time in 4.x there is several enhancements/additions/breaking changes to&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>rule engine </li>
<li>async/await support&nbsp;</li>
<li>serialization </li>
<li>dataportal </li>
</ul></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 21, 2013</h2><p>I do plan to update the &#39;Using CSLA 4&#39; books to 4.5 later this year, but the update isn&#39;t that substantial - primarily focused on</p>
<ol>
<li>The new async/await features</li>
<li>New business rule engine features</li>
<li>Building WinRT apps</li>
</ol>
<p>And those are good and worthy enhancements - but they don&#39;t really change the value of the existing book content.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mar72Vin replied on Monday, January 21, 2013</h2><p>Thanks Rocky! This is the answer I was looking for (it&#39;s good to know that a new/revised book is on the horizon). I&#39;ve just received the download code for the eBook from the CSLA store. This should get me going until the new enhancements have their own eBook.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Wednesday, January 30, 2013</h2><p>Are there *any* sample projects that fully utilize the new features of 4.5 so we can learn from them?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, February 02, 2013</h2><p>Yes, SimpleNTier, SampleApp, and (at least most of) ProjectTracker are all using the new async/await data portal features.</p>
<p>I also think Jonny added examples for the various new rule engine features to the rules sample.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
