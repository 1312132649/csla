<p>However, you might consider using them.</p>
<p>One of the primary requests by users and developers, going all the way back to the early days of VB (so 1993 or so) has been for the entire app to <em>not lock up</em> every time it talks to the database or server.</p>
<p>The way you avoid having the entire app lock up is to use async calls to the application server. That&#39;s what the async data portal does.</p>
<p>The upside is that the app doesn&#39;t lock up all the time. The down side is that you (the developer) need to more carefully restrict what the user can and can&#39;t do while the async operation is running. You don&#39;t want the user clicking the Save button repeatedly and queuing up multiple redundant saves...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
