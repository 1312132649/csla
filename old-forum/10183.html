<p>I currently have Csla Business Objects 2005, 2008, the 2.1.4 eBook&nbsp;and the Silverlight Video collection (all for c#). I was noticing on a few posts that people are loading their child objects via a child_fetch, along with matching child_xyz counterparts. I also saw some stuff about children notifying&nbsp;their parents to know when they have changed. This is GREAT stuff that I am missing. </p>
<p>So what book/ebook am I missing that goes over this? I searched the forums, blogs,etc and can&#39;t find much mention of it. I do find some hints, but especially the grandchild thing is important to me and I dont see that anywhere.</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
