The problem is that I cannot find a way to convert the EditForm.cs and IRefresh interface for use with a Page form and because I can't do this, i cannot do any of the binding in the XAML.<br /><br />Has anybody else used Pages instead of windows and how have they done the CSLA binding?<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, October 12, 2009</h2><P>You mean the page model with the built-in navigation where the WPF app is 'hosted' in a pseudo-browser?</P>
<P>That model is a real mess, and I really, really hope Microsoft eventually just kills it off (not that they will). It is a mess because whoever designed that model worked very hard to simulate the web - you know, how web browsers and servers can't remember anything between transitions?</P>
<P>To do this, it appears WPF spins up isolated memory for each page, and erases all data as you move to another page. It really sucks, and I never did figure out a reliable way to remember anything from page to page...</P>
<P>In Chris Anderson's 'WPF Unleashed' book he has a whole chapter where he builds a mini-framework to overcome some of the limitations of the page model - but even that wasn't enough to make me successful.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiptop replied on Monday, October 12, 2009</h2>I am using the PageController object to load pages into a MainForm that has a content frame. Each page is based on a System.Windows.Controls.Page control.<br /><br />This is loaded into the content frame.<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, October 12, 2009</h2><P>Yeah, all I can say is good luck. I spent some time with this model and found it to be incredibly frustrating. Even things like storing values on the thread (which Csla.ApplicationContext does) turned out to be unreliable...</P>
<P>The way I look at UI frameworks is that if I spend 2-3 days fighting with it and even after that time it is making my life harder instead of easier, then that framework must have some serious issues...</P>
<P>That said, maybe you'll have better luck with it. Maybe it is a zen thing, and I just wasn't able to <EM>be the UI</EM> sufficiently enough to understand what they were trying to do to me (sorry, I mean do <EM>for </EM>me).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiptop replied on Wednesday, October 14, 2009</h2>Thanks for the information Rocky. <br /><br />We are not using a web-based type page navigation but simply using the page controller to load WPF Pages into a content frame.<br /><br />I have managed to convert the EditForm equivalent usercontrol object into a custom Page object.<br /><br />We will see how it goes and hopefully won't hit the problems you described as we are using it in a different manner.<br /><br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
