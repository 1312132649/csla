<P>We found the following two problems in CSLA 3.5 beta 2:</P>
<OL>
<LI>BusinessListBase throws a NullReferenceException when ClearItems() is called and the collection does not contain any items. The exception is thrown because the field _positionMap is null in this case.Possible solution: call DeferredLoadPositionMapIfNotLoaded() before calling _positionMap.ClearMap()</LI>
<LI>ReadOnlyBindingList throws a NullReferenceException when ClearItems() is called and the collection does not contain any items. The exception is thrown because the field _indexSet is null in this case. Possible solution: call DeferredLoadIndexIfNotLoaded() before calling&nbsp;_indexSet.ClearIndexes()</LI></OL>
<P>Hopefully these problems can be fixed before CSLA 3.5 is released?!</P>
<P>Cheers,<BR>Herman</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, March 25, 2008</h2>I believe these were reported a few days ago and were addressed. Please give the new RC1 build (online today) a try and see if that resolves the issues.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>McManus replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>In ReadOnlyBindingList the issue is solved indeed.</P>
<P>However, in BusinessListBase the exception still occurs. Note that in BusinessListBase the exception is thrown because _positionMap is null. The field _indexSet is handled correctly.</P>
