<P>this is very basic, but have you added a dll reference to your business layer library and the CSLA dll &nbsp;to your Win app?&nbsp; In addition, add "Imports ...&nbsp;type in&nbsp;whatever the name of your business layer library is..." to the top of your Win app code page.&nbsp; You can see examples of this in the ProjectTracker app Rocky built.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
