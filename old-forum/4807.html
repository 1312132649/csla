UI, business layer, data access layer, database.&nbsp; If you need to seperate physically the business layer from the data access layer, Csla can do that with a config file change.&nbsp; That's were Wcf comes into play;&nbsp; business objects run their code at the client as well as a server, and so need to move across the wire.&nbsp; Wcf is one of the ways business objects can move across the network so that the data access code may execute on the application server.&nbsp;

Csla objects can still travel from the web server to an application server though to improve security (at the cost of performance).&nbsp; You then would use your BO to fill a DTO which is sent out from the web service.&nbsp; A DTO comes back to the web service and you re-create your BO, pop in the new values and you can then see if your business rules are met.&nbsp; That scenario is a good use of Csla.&nbsp; The client side of the web service is it's own application and you can use Csla there too; the difference is that instead of actually doing the save, the DataPortal_XYZ methods would make calls to the service and return appropriate state to indicate if something failed.&nbsp; It depensd on what you're doing and how you're architecting your application(s).<br><br>You may want to read some of Rocky's thoughts on SOA too; he says that SOA is forced into many applications where its really not appropriate.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; He also talks about Csla and SOA:<br>http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CategoryView,category,Service-Oriented.aspx.&nbsp; Additionally, he's posted&nbsp; here on the forum several times.<br><br>Csla offers much much more than mobile objects though; that's only one part of the framework, and you need not use it to get the other benefits.&nbsp; Authorization and validation, as well as helping you to keep data access code to limited areas of the code are also great benefits, in addition to thinks as built in support for databinding, etc.<br><br>I can't comment on WSSF specificially, but basically you can have your web service built on top of Csla business objects; that would be your "UI" layer and clients of your service need not care.&nbsp; <br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>smiley riley replied on Friday, May 09, 2008</h2><P>First of I think the idea behind csla is a good one. Unfortunately for me it does not deliver, and I will now explain why, just picking up on the n-tier for starts. I have just picked up an application created using csla, and need to make some quick changes before I can CTRL-A and build an enterprise version. Having come from a campany with a team of good developers we created our own framework over a period of years following proper n-tier and gang of four practices.</P>
<P>Any business object which has functionality in property setters will never work over webservices without loosing all that functionality or compromising the whole integrity of webservices. A bit like exposing Datasets to the world over SOAP, do not do it. So if I use CSLA objects over SOAP using my WSDL as the contract how when I pass that object back do I know it is Dirty&nbsp;or is&nbsp;New or is to be archived/deleted? All of a sudden my 'Save Object' become Update, Add, Delete and my front end gets more BLL than it needs to have! In my opinion it does anyway!&nbsp;Not a biggie just replace all the property setter stuff with a prepopulated set of underlying values and a model base that uses a virtual method that uses reflection to determine the values are equal or not as the case maybe when they come back. Override it in the child class should reflection be too slow. Yes you need to know about Generics too.</P>
<P>DataProvider. This is the biggie and the one that infuriates me more than anything. Having a DAL that uses the specific DataAdapter referenced in it does not satisfy Abstraction from the database. A switch statement for every update, select, delete statement with an entry for each DB type is flawed. The DAL should only know about the System.Data abstractions/interfaces, and for this you would need a DataProvider with specifics for differing database types, this does not exist in any form I am aware of in csla.</P>
<P>IMHO read Craig Larman 'Applying UML and Patterns' and once you have a grasp of the principles in that book, then take a look at CSLA. You will then understand the principles behind it and whether you think it will save you the time you think it is going to.</P>

<P>Yes yes I understand this, but this is again flawed for the reasons I gave above. You have then created two sets of models one a DTO model the other a business Model if you like. What is the difference between these objects, excluding the obvious business functions methods in the Business Model. I would be suprised if there was any.</P>
<P>The advantage of Business Model over DTO model it that in essence and correct me if I am wrong, because all the methods are included with the data GRASP states we have 'Information Expert' we also have High Cohesion through Communicational Cohesion. That is the principle anyway.</P>
<P>My argument is this.</P>
<P>An object to store data has a functional task of storing data and nothing more hence a Model object should contain no functionality other than that to support in memory datastorage, what you would call a DTO. All tasks for that model should be transferable accross barriers, including Soap. Which basically means Getters and setters with no functionality. The business logic component has the functional task of carrying out functional requirements not storing data. So seperating these two functions looses you information expert granted, However you have gained low coupling, and high cohesion (Logical, functional and sequential)&nbsp; You do not have to write a DTO to BO 'Data Access Layer' because the SOAP standard dictates that for you and takes all the work out of it for you. You start to look at your applications as applications that carry out task and not applications that store data, this also aids testing, and links nicely in to UML and use cases.</P>

<P>Certainly you should not try to use SmartDate in a DTO to/from a service or a database. In those cases you need to pass date values in some form that is accepted on both sides of the conversation. </P>
<P>And if your application does use the concept of an 'empty' date then both sides need to agree on what that means too - often string.Empty, null or some specific date value (typically a very old one).</P>
<P>If you are using .NET 3.5 you might look at the DateTimeOffset type. The primary issue people run into when transferring date values is time zone translation. And DateTimeOffset is supposed to help with this issue (though I haven't really dug into to see if it solves anything).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>smiley riley replied on Monday, May 12, 2008</h2><P>Justin,</P>
<P>I don't confess to be an OO expert by any means my level is probably like your own, but as developers we all know there is application of all these theories and you can pick and take these as you choose and what suits you. IMHO when it comes down to it if you are uber good and can deliver good software time and time again and at the same time&nbsp;not follow any standards, then who is anyone to say you are wrong. It maybe tricky to take over the code but thats why Microsoft created Ctrl &amp; A is it not. ;-)</P>
<P>You are spending time reading csla, and my point is if you have the OO knowlege I dont' think it would take you any longer creating your own base classes for DB, MSMQ DAL standards etc. Just create your common components with flexibility so new functionality can be brought on later. Most people have some sort of DATA Helper class (if not adapt microsofts old one in petshop) simple but effective. An easy way is to take that class create an abstract version of it exposing Interfaces and Abstract types (System.Data.common)&nbsp;rather than say SQLCient types. When you need to add oracle inherit the base class and add any functionality required. Don't forget to check the DbType Mappings and create functions to get around the lack of compliance between database vendors and the base DbType. Probably the most painful part.</P>
<P>It is by no way clean as like I said above DB vendors did not seem to follow a Type Pattern so work has to be done around this for Bool, Blobs Clobs etc but once the base class is written you can write a new database implementation using the base implementation in a day, and if you move from SQL to Oracle it will only be the Provider you need to change.</P>

<P>The data portal itself is a message-based model and is essentially SOA, but that's usually not what people are interested in, nor does it sound like what you are after here.</P>
<P>CSLA is an excellent fit when building applications on the system edge. These applications are typically interactive and so all the data binding and business logic capabilities of CSLA work very well to help you create a rich user experience. And since CSLA doesn't care how your objects get their data, you can get/update the data by calling services just as easily as you can by calling stored procedures.</P>
<P>CSLA can be a good fit for building service applications (the actual services that comprise your overall system). Some services are little more than glorified stored procedures, and then CSLA isn't a great fit - but those are really lame services anyway and if that's all you've got then you probably shouldn't be doing SOA to start with... But services that do interesting work, that encapsulate business functionality and behavior (not just data access) must be written to implement all that business behavior. CSLA is one good option for building this type of service. As are various workflow and business rule engine products. Since service implementations are batch-mode, non-interactive, back-end code there are many great options dating back at least 30 years that all will work quite well if used properly. All the lessons of COBOL and FORTRAN totally apply in this space - seriously.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>justin.fisher replied on Thursday, May 08, 2008</h2><font face="Courier New">Thanks to everyone for the great comments.&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as SOA goes I believe I may be confusing a buzz word (SOA) for the concept of clean seperation between user interface / work flow logic, business rules / logic and data access.<br><br>The <a>application architecture whitepapers</a> that the microsoft patterns and practices group puts out suggests that a service interface layer is prudent whenever you begin to add that second user interface.&nbsp; Following that guidance is what led me down the road to SOA via the patterns and practices web service software factory.<br><br>I wish I had found this framework two months ago, to draw in a different perspective on things.

<p class=MsoNormal><span>But ultimately the key to success is that clean separation between
the UI and business layers (which doesn&#8217;t have to be a physical network
boundary &#8211; just a logical boundary). Chapter 1 of my book provides pretty
good coverage of this, along with other important concepts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Well I discovered pretty quickly that building that framework is really hard and incurrs it's own costs.&nbsp; I have to dedicate time to the framework which is time I am not out making money and I won't be able to recoupe those costs for 2-3 </font><font face="Courier New">(or more?)</font><font face="Courier New">projects that use that framework and that is assuming I get the framework right!<br><br>This effort has been a real lesson.&nbsp; I purchased a used copy of your book on amazon but after two days of waiting my patience wore out so I ordered the eBook from APress.&nbsp; I haven't had a chance to read much, but the stuff I have seen seems like it was plucked directly from my own framework requirments.&nbsp; I had the what but not the how.&nbsp; I'm encouraged with what I have seen so far and am hopeful that this framework will give me that competitive advantage I was hoping to create with my own framework.<br><br></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>zinovate replied on Thursday, May 08, 2008</h2><P>Given your experience, you'll love Expert Biz Object 2005. It's a great read. I'm sure that you'll see Rocky go through allot of the problems that you faced over the years. I sure did. The ebooks help fill in the gaps on the more current changes, especially WCF. </P>
<P>CSLA will give you a leg up for sure. </P>
<P>The fact that Rocky is working hard on Silverlight support is too awesome. I can't wait to start playing with it. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SomeGuy replied on Wednesday, May 07, 2008</h2><P>CSLA is all about a rich, interactive user experience. It puts the business logic (validation, etc.) very close to the user/UI. Then to support scaling, and security, it uses the concept of mobile objects to move the BO to the server to be persisted. The same BO is used in both places and there is only 1 application which can be configured to run as 1-tier, 2-tier, or 3-tier by just changing the configuration files.</P>
<P>If you need to open up your system to 3rd party applications, then SOA is it, otherwise you are going to write 2 applications that are going to have the same, or at least similar business layer.</P>
