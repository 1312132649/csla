<p class="MsoNormal">First of all I would like to say it is good to be back.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have been on non-CSLA projects for a while
now and a new opportunity may let me continue where I left off.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is going to start off long-winded but I
wanted to frame my need the best I could.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At a high level, this new opportunity was begun (before I
started here) with the intention to be Object Oriented,
have flexibility in deployment options and be maintainable.<span>&nbsp; </span>The team came to these goals after working on
legacy systems that, well, were not.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
promises of Object Oriented design/programming and CSLA lead them here to the path we have been on, however, underlying philosophies and practices
of team individuals were not supportive of best practice implementation of Object Oriented coding and CSLA.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most of the remaining team now admit that the
aspects of maintainability / performance trade-offs were ignored.&nbsp; So that is the summary of our history to arrive at the current dilemma…</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The application, which performed decently in test and QA
environments, now performs very poorly with a distant production database
server whether we physically separate our code tiers or not.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are some things we know where we are at
fault; multi-functional user stories turned into overly complex business objects
and forms (code reuse won over lightweight objects), an only loose grasp of
data transfer methods and their performance differences, and a deep and
hierarchical object graph that accommodates a diverse set of behaviors.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even with all of that in our collective consciousness
we are asking ourselves, "Has anyone seen an enterprise sized Object Oriented/CSLA appliaction that performs well?"<span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So, finally, I come to our question(s) for this
community to help us move past the “Can OO*/CSLA... ?” question.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>Who
has had success with the development, deployment and maintenance of an enterprise
sized application?<span>&nbsp; </span>What are some usage
statistics for your application? <span>&nbsp;</span>Some
examples of what we’re looking for…</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The industry your application serves</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Size of the development team</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The number of concurrent/total users</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Size of database</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Method of data transfer (All-In-One BO (like PT application) =&gt; Database OR DTO's, etc)<br></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Describe most complex object graph (in general
terms of course) and it's perfomance issues/solutions<br></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Anything else that would loosely quantify a size:success
ratio of your application (I know, this is a fuzzy discussion all on its own).<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Looking back over this I realize I am asking a-lot from you.&nbsp; Hopefully some of you will see this as a help the community as well by getting
together a list of success stories and comparing each others usage demands.&nbsp; <br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks in Advance,</p>

But i hope it'll be in my situation.<br /><br />--- NO SUCCESS STORY YET!! ---<br /><br />We have high requirements.<br />Just fast feedback to your question(s).<br /><br />- The industry your application serves<br />Insurrance crm / administration / advice (business to business)<br /><br />- Size of the development team<br />At the moment just me and 2 others building the application framework and sample applications. Will go from 30 till 40 code monkeys when our application framework layer has passed it first stage ;)<br /><br />- The number of concurrent/total users<br />That depends, we currently have a licence based legacy application running which is going to be replaced piece by piece. As example we have an customer who has requirements for 1000+ concurrent users.<br /><br />- Size of the database<br />Each customer has over 1200 tables. For the legacy delphi application it's insane large. Keeping history of all changes over a root contract table with 300.000 records it are millions and millions of records. That customer had a total database size of 23 GB.<br /><br />- Method of data transfer<br />From BO to DTO using the Objectfactory pattern where the DTO to DB is handled by an ORM.<br /><br />- Describe most complex object graph<br />I expect that will be financial objects and perhaps contract deferral. No issues yet, since i wrote above, no success story yet.<br /><br />- Anything else..<br />I wish we were further and could publish more information.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>strick9 replied on Thursday, March 26, 2009</h2>Thanks for chiming in.&nbsp; This looks ambitious, good luck and thanks for the info.<br><br>Brian<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>whelzer replied on Thursday, March 26, 2009</h2><span><span><span></span></span></span>Could/hopefully be an interesting thread:<br><br><br>We are fairly new the CSLA and .Net in fact,&nbsp; around Aug 08 we enagaged Dunn Traning for a 3 day course and we have not looked back since.<span></span>&nbsp; We are taking a large VB 6 into the modern world&nbsp; So far CSLA has been a huge success.<br>

<P>Root Node</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Node&nbsp;collection</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Node</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</P>
<P>Additionally each child had a time series for allocations, which was a dynamic class with up to 150 time based properties (used a property bag, ITypedList, ICustomTypeDescriptor behind the scenes).&nbsp; We did some tricks to group changes of multiple time points with the same allocation value so that database updates were quick (this is where we found most of the performance issues).</P>
