One site said it is malware and I should block it, another said it is important to keep my computer running well and I should allow it!<br /><br />Anyone know exactly what this is, why it is here, and whether or not I should uninstall or block it, or allow it? Any info is appreciated.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>bniemyjski replied on Tuesday, November 08, 2011</h2><p>It appears that it is trying to connect to the internet to download <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/clr/thread/7eed95ab-5562-4c48-a81d-7792566da539">updated&nbsp;certificates</a>.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
