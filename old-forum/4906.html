<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I have several applications in production which were written using my own framework.&nbsp; There are some things I like about it, and some I don't -- specifically loading data from the data access layer into the business object layer.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I'm considering abandoning my framework and going with CSLA, but I don't know where to start.&nbsp; I'm currently using VS 2005, but will probably be going to&nbsp;2008 in the near future.&nbsp; Since <SPAN id=btAsinTitle><U>Expert VB 2005 Business Objects</U> was written for 2005, would it still be applicable for 2008?</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P>If you are using VS 2005 you should consider using CSLA 3.0.</P>
<P>If you are using VS 2008 you can use 3.0, or use the newer 3.5.</P>
<P>Version 3.0 is a continuation of version 2.1, and so has basically been around for three years now. Thus it is pretty well tested and widely used. It works with VS 2005 or 2008, and .NET 2.0 or 3.0.</P>
<P>Version 3.5 has been out for just a few weeks, though some people have been using it extensively since early this year. Still, it isn't as widely used or tested. However, it does offer LINQ to CSLA, and perhaps more importantly a lot of changes that result in major code reduction when writing business objects - often 35-40% less code is required to write an object!</P>
<P>Version 3.5 <EM>requires</EM> VS 2008 and .NET 3.5.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, May 29, 2008</h2><P>I am one who has been using CSLA 3.5 for some time. I would recommend very highly starting with that if you can, as if you want to take advantage of the managed properties and such (I suggest you should) you'll find it a lot easier to handle it now than try to retrofit later. </P>
<P>The downside of course is that you really have to deal with multiple texts to get up to speed, and you may find that to be too cumbersome. Supposedly we should be seeing a new book this year that covers 2008/3.5 - I for one am looking forward to it just for a good refresher. &nbsp;</P>
