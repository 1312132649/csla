<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm trying find a copy of an article written by Rocky called "A Simple Business Rules Manager".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This used to exist in the MSDN "Adventures in Visual Basic .Net" web site but is now&nbsp;gone and I can't find a copy of it anywhere.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If someone has a copy of it, or can find a link to it can you please post it here.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks,</DIV>

They chose to remove the content from that column (that Billy Hollis and I wrote) quite a while ago, and it isn't available anywhere (to my knowledge) except maybe on old MSDN subscription DVDs.</P>
<P>On the upside, many of my column topics&nbsp;were subsets of concepts or code that found their way into CSLA .NET. There are a couple exceptions, but most of the ideas are in the framework.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ctwalker replied on Tuesday, August 26, 2008</h2><DIV>I appreciate the reply.&nbsp; Too bad they pulled the article, it was pretty good.&nbsp; I may have a hard copy of it at the house, I'll have to see if I can dig it up.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I also have your book <EM>Expert VB 2005 Business Objects.</EM>&nbsp; It's probably time to start reading it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks again for the reply.</DIV>
