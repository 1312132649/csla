The control in the view for the BusinessListBase property is a grid and the grid does in fact display the objects in the businesslistbase, however I can&#39;t scroll up and down in the grid, its locked to the first record.</p>
<p>In the data source window I have the Model set as details and the BusinessListBase collection is defined as a datagrid, yet it seems like the behavior that I&#39;m see is that because the model is defined as details all objects below that are being treaded the same way. It doesn&#39;t really make sense and so if someone can please offer advise that would be great</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
