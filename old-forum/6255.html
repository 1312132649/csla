<P>When I select to edit a company, and have contacts, their ranks are not displaying in the combo box.&nbsp; I select the combo box and it is populated, but there is something off with the binding in that it does not display the value that was entered for the contact.</P>
<P>Also, how do you get a prompt to ask if someone really wants to delete something.&nbsp; For example, I add a Rank, then delete it and I am not asked if I really want&nbsp;to delete the item.&nbsp; How do I do this?&nbsp; I remember in ASP.NET there was a little java script code in there as follows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;asp:LinkButton ID="DeleteLinkButton" runat="server" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CausesValidation="False" CommandName="Delete"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text="Delete" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OnClientClick="return confirm('Do you really want to delete this record?')"&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/asp:LinkButton&gt;</P>
<P>This worked well and prompted the user before they deleted the record.</P>
<P>So, how do I get an item to show in a combo box and how do I prompt the user to really delete a record?</P>
<P>Thanks for everyone's help so far.&nbsp; I am digging in and absorbing Silverlight really well and cannot wait for CodeComplete to come out and generate Silverlight code so I can crank out my application.</P>
