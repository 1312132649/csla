I changed my connectionstring so that it works locally. I rebuilt csla.dll (that worked fine). </P>
<P>However, I tried rebuilding PTWpf and I got errors...</P>
<P>The errors are in the xaml files. It says that the Assembly 'Csla' cannot be found. This error occurs on the line :</P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>

<P>Look in PTWpf\bin\debug and make sure Csla.dll is there.</P>
<P>Also, make sure you are building everything in debug mode (to start with anyway). I often make that mistake - building Csla.dll in Release mode and then I'm unable to build ProjectTracker because it references the debug version that isn't there...</P>
<P>Also, the file reference uses relative paths. It is assumed that you unzip everything so the relative paths are the same as they are for me:</P>
<P>...\cslacs\csla<BR>...\ProjectTrackercs<BR>...\cslatest</P>
