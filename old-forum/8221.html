But for me and my family this is the holiday season, and I would like to extend my best wishes and thanks to everyone on this forum and CSLA .NET users around the world.</P>
<P>I get emails on a regular basis, often several a week, from CSLA .NET users. People who are doing small business apps, large enterprise apps, and applications for organizations that are changing the world in some amazing ways. Some emails are summaries of cool projects, others are personal thanks where my books, videos or CSLA .NET have made someone's job or career better.</P>
<P>I find this amazing and humbling, and it is a great honor for me to be part of so many wonderful software projects around the world. Thank you all so very much for your support.</P>
<P>You have the best possible wishes from me and my family for this holiday season, the upcoming year and the next decade. May fortune smile upon you, your families and loved ones.</P>
<P>Merry Christmas to one and all!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>forrest replied on Thursday, December 24, 2009</h2>Merry Xmas!<br>Rock and all of your family&nbsp; :)<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Tuesday, December 29, 2009</h2>Same to you, Mr. Rockford.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Tuesday, December 29, 2009</h2>The x-mas is over by now, but still on vacation until next year..<br /><br />Happy and safe newyear!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FoodmanCyclingPA replied on Wednesday, December 30, 2009</h2><P>I agree with that!&nbsp; Happy Holidays to everyone and thanks for all you do Rocky&nbsp;in helping us develop applications faster and with spending less time on "plumbing" code with your framework.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Also want to thank Sergey and all the others who respond to our questions when we stumble into a roadblock in development.&nbsp; A lot of folks have responded to my questions and helped me out and saved me from pulling more hair out of my head!&nbsp; I have responded to a few questions and hopefully helped, but hope to be able to do that more as I go into 2010 in full hammer mode in developing an Enterprise application utilizing the Csla framework and current tools.</P>
<P>Thanks again and hope everyone has a great 2010.</P>
