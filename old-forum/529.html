I've had this work when using a GUID because then its easy, you can just go BO.NewBO(new Guid());, but with an int, you can't set the ID until it has done a round trip from the DB). <br><br>This is one error I get, another member posted on the same problem but didn't get any replies. <br>DataPortal_Create(object)' hides inherited member 'Csla.Core.BusinessBase.DataPortal_Create(object)'. To make the current member override that implementation, add the override keyword. Otherwise add the new keyword.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><br>Code: <br><br><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static User NewUser()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return DataPortal.Create&lt;User&gt;(new object());<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [RunLocal()]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private void DataPortal_Create(object criteria)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><font size="3"><br>Supposedly this should work, and the create works for my user, but for the Role class, it throws an error in the DataPortal.&nbsp; hmm. <br><br>In my user class, set up as it is above, my DataPortal_Insert method doesn't even get called on the Save() method. <br><br>Anyone have any thoughts as to where to look for the error in my code? <br><br><br></font><br><br></font><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, July 03, 2006</h2>Do what the compiler says..<br><br>Instead of your create being private void, it probably should be protected override..<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>brettswift replied on Monday, July 03, 2006</h2>My creates in several other classes have the same signature, private void, and they work perfectly. <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
