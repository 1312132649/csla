<p>my front end is very thin (Windows Forms) and all the work is done at the back end.&nbsp; I would like to have some kind of a server control panel which would let the user start/stop the server and possibly have a &quot;peek&quot; at what is going on in the server (i.e., some GUI done in Windows Forms).</p>
<p>How do I configure my applications (both client side and server side). For example, data portal (url?, proxy?... and other settings).&nbsp; Any examples, links?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you All,</p>

<p>Note that this won&#39;t get you real time updates; you&#39;ll have to execute the get status command every so often to update.&nbsp; If you need realtime updates, you&#39;ll have to step outside of Csla and probably look at the Wcf support for two way connections.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
