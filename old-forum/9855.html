This is probably the last beta release of version 4.1, so please download and try it&nbsp;&ndash; I appreciate any help I can get in testing these releases.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx</span></strong></a></p>
<p>The primary changes in beta 2 include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Added a new Csla.Xaml.PropertyInfo control for WP7, WPF and Silverlight that is like PropertyStatus but totally non-visual. See the Samples\NET\cs\SimpleNTier solution&rsquo;s WP7 UI project for an example of how this works</li>
<li>Created a copy of the DataAnnotations functionality for WP7; this is a nice concept that Microsoft didn&rsquo;t put into WP7, so I ported the parts of System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations required by CSLA .NET, so if you have classes using DataAnnotations attributes in .NET or Silverlight, that code will now work in WP7 as well</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork for a NuGet installer when 4.1 is released, so people will be able to download and install CSLA 4 via NuGet (thanks Jaans!)</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork for a vsix installer for Visual Studio templates, so when 4.1 is released we can add this to the Visual Studio gallery (thanks Jonny!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also put an updated draft of <em>Using CSLA 4: Creating Business Objects</em> online at <a href="http://download.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?t=UsingCsla4" title="http://download.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?t=UsingCsla4"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">http://download.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?t=UsingCsla4</span></strong></a></p>
<p>This ebook is incomplete, but I&rsquo;m providing work-in-progress drops of the book as I work on it. People who&rsquo;ve purchased the entire <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series (from <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">http://store.lhotka.net/</span></strong></a>) can download this pre-draft content. This new drop includes a lot more content than the previous drop&nbsp;&ndash; including the entire sections on declaring and implementing properties and methods, and a good start on the metastate fields/methods available from BusinessBase and other base classes.</p>
<p>Finally, I <em>also</em> put a top level type diagram online that is available to anyone who has purchased either the <em>Using CSLA 4: CSLA .NET Overview</em> ebook or the entire ebook series. It is available from the same download.lhotka.net web page.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
