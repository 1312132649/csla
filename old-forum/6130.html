<P>Even if there are tools in the Silverlight space they'll be immature. But even more importantly, the report <EM>generation</EM> should occur on the server so it is efficient, and only display should occur on the client.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sergeyb replied on Tuesday, January 13, 2009</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I wrote a blog entry that should help you get started with
SilverLight reporting.&nbsp; It covers both SSRS and Crystal (both server side
of course), as well as options to show reports in a popup browser window or
make them looks as part of SL application using IFRAME.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hi,<br>
My Team is about to start a new project and we're currently thinking of using
Silverlight (and of course CSLA light) the one thing which we are a bit worried
about is Reports. Is there any good tools for reporting in Silverlight? Either
directly on our Business objects or on the Database (generated on the server
and sent to the client)<br>
<br>
Or would the best solution be to have ASP.NET reports and just link to them?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Chris.<br>
