plus a &ldquo;zero code-behind&rdquo; philosophy with CSLA 4. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to put the intro video out there for free. It is a good video, 
covering the basics of the pattern, my approach to the pattern and how a 
CSLA-based Model works best in the pattern.</p>

<p>The rest of the series will be demo-based, covering the specifics of 
implementation. I&rsquo;ll add another blog post when that&rsquo;s available for purchase, 
but I thought I&rsquo;d get this intro online now so people can make use of it.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cds replied on Thursday, June 03, 2010</h2><p>Great video - thanks Rocky!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lukky replied on Friday, June 04, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Rocky,</p>
<p>I really appreciate this kind of &quot;mile high&quot; view of things.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t wait to get the rest of the series. have you thought&nbsp;about the&nbsp;pricing yet ?</p>
<p>Regards</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, June 04, 2010</h2><p>Hey Rocky, will you have an option to pre-order the videos?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 04, 2010</h2><p>Probably. But I must be honest - I ended up spending most of this week working with customers, I&#39;m at Tech Ed next week and family vacation the week following. So unless I can sneak some time in here late at night or on a weekend, the next segment won&#39;t be done until around June 23 <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Chris replied on Saturday, June 05, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;ve been working with your MVVM framework for a month or so.&nbsp; I found the video helpful to watch and I look forward to the upcoming segments.&nbsp; I have used PRISM (all versions)&nbsp;since its inception (formerly CAB ... used that one too!) and I am enjoying the progression of your lightweight xaml framework.&nbsp; The nice thing is how it is built to support csla objects.&nbsp; That is particularly nice.&nbsp; I grew weary of using PRISM, for my latest project&nbsp;,&nbsp;since I simply didn&#39;t need the complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I switched (about a month ago) to using your lightweight MVVM framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;The code reduction and clarity is remarkable!&nbsp; I&nbsp;do miss&nbsp;the event publication/event subscription support that is found in PRISM.&nbsp; I know your MVVM framework is a teaching tool, but, I would be interested to know if anyone has successfully integrated pub/sub support into your framework.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Chris</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, June 05, 2010</h2><p>Yeah, the pub/sub feature is really nice. I know people who &quot;use PRISM&quot; for only that one feature.</p>
<p>I only made my Bxf code available perhaps 2 months ago, so it hasn&#39;t been public very long. There have not been any additions/contributions to that codebase.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>HK.Lee replied on Sunday, June 06, 2010</h2><p>I too changed to Bxf framework&nbsp;for 10 or so&nbsp;view size apps&nbsp;because it is&nbsp;the most lightweight&nbsp;and use PRISM larger than that. In addition with Chris, I miss pub/sub event feature too. For PRISM 4.0, drop 1 showed up last week and&nbsp; I&nbsp;found&nbsp; they use their own ViewModelBase class,don&#39;t know how deep level the type is winded up so can&#39;t be coexist with Csla ViewModelbase, I am afraid&nbsp;I have to add most of all features in CSLA&#39;s ViewModelBase. I think Bxf + event pub/sub + MEF would be the most lightweight and useful one for CSLA&#39;ers. I hope this kind of open project is started and shared&nbsp;with &nbsp;in this forum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I am sure I&#39;m not an expert but wud like to share my 2cents knowledge. MEF will replace PRISM&#39;s Unity Container and add some other functionality. Event pub/sub and RegionManager is still the unique parts of PRISM, though Jerremy even replace regionManager with MEF. Pls refer his article <a href="http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2010/03/mef-instead-of-prism-for-silverlight-3.html">http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2010/03/mef-instead-of-prism-for-silverlight-3.html</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;In his series of article, it is aslo well explained how modules&nbsp;can be&nbsp;loaded&nbsp;dynamically usign MEF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also about to start a silverlight + wpf project consisting of 250~300 views using CSLA 4.0 and PRISM3.0&nbsp;+ MEF.&nbsp;Now I&#39;m considering whether&nbsp;I have to drop PRISM and use Bxf+MEF instead, because it is useless to add heavier component such as Unity and others which MEF can fully address. Only one thing unsolved is Event pub/sub feature if I stick to Bxf + MEF. </p>
<p>Furthermore ,though it is so early stage, PRISM4.0 has own viewmodelbase class which has a few funcions at current&nbsp;but not implemented as&nbsp;an interface,in which what I&#39;m afraid is how much I have to&nbsp;tweak them to adapt&nbsp;in CSLA&#39;s viewmodelbase. With MVVM, viewmodelbase of Csla is&nbsp;second to none as far as I&#39;m going with CSLA,I think. Though I have used composite app block from CAB/SCSF and PRISM and am very happy with them , I&nbsp;might have&nbsp;to consider&nbsp;seriously to drop them&nbsp;if it is difficult to&nbsp;coexist with CSLA&#39;s MVVM when PRISM 4.0 is out,of course&nbsp;many gurus of PRISM will&nbsp;be sure to fully address most issues.</p>
<p>my 2cents with poor english. Thanks.</p>

<p>My SL app is a naviagtion app ... unfortunately, I am far from implementing dynamic module loading yet ... not a priority right now ...&nbsp;but, I&#39;ve read several articles on the possibility of dynamic module loading ... Here is one article I read ... <a href="http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2009/11/dynamic-module-loading-with-silverlight.html">http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2009/11/dynamic-module-loading-with-silverlight.html</a></p>
<p>Chris</p>
<p>HK.Lee and Dan ... if you read this ... I encountered an &quot;edit level&quot; issue with MVVM ... I was wondering if you too have encountered it too .. post: <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/9052/43026.aspx#43026">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/9052/43026.aspx#43026</a></p>
