In otherwords, is there some way to refer to the EditableRootList object and automatically retrieve the properties of the record that is displayed in the grid as the "current" row?<br><br>I know how to do a GetItem but that requires me to read the grid, extract the id of the item that I want to retrieve from the collection and then call GetItem. What I would like is a set of properties that always exposed values that were derived from the "current" record.<br><br>Any help would be appreciated greatly.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 28, 2006</h2>Currency is managed by the BindingSource control - that is one of its major responsibilities. So that is the place you should go to find the current row/object.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DanEssin replied on Tuesday, August 29, 2006</h2>thanks<br /><br />RockfordLhotka wrote:<br /><br />> Currency is managed by the BindingSource control - that is one of its <br />> major responsibilities.
