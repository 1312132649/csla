When
 scaffolding views for the business objects, the scaffolding engine 
fails with the following message:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Error</p>
<p>There was an error running the selected code generator:
  <br />&#39;The method or operation is not implemented.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of note, the business objects are split into three partial classes 
each.  The &quot;Model class&quot; select list in the &quot;Add View&quot; window shows 
three of each class name, but selecting any of the three for any of the 
business object classes gives the same error.
</p>
<p>How can I find out what is causing the actual error and either correct it or find a workaround?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, April 06, 2015</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you checked or posted on the ASP.NET discussion forums? This is probably an ASP.NET MVC issue.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC is open source so you may also debug this yourself?&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
