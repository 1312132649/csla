<p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I had combined this and other questions on a different post but for clarity, I&nbsp;though&nbsp;it would be best if I separated the questions so I ended up deciding to create a new post for this specific&nbsp;question, I apologize
is this was the wrong thing to do!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here is my question,</p>
</p>
<p>Can you or&nbsp;someone&nbsp;else let me know why does &quot;CommonBusinessRule&quot; extends &quot;BusinessRule&quot; by adding the &quot;Severity&quot; property?</p>
<p>I would have expected for the &quot;Severity&quot; property to be part of the core &quot;IBusinessRule&quot; interface since I figured it was an integral part of the broken rule functionality.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
