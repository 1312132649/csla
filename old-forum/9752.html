<p>It seems to me that the above code would cause threading issues with the UseLocalDataPortal field being static. Plus, Isn&#39;t the proxy cached for performance? How bad of a performance cost would ctoring a new proxy for each dataportal request cause? </p>
<p>I thought about creating my own RunRemote attribute, but it would seem silly to duplicate the caching efforts of the DataPortalMethodInfo cache that csla does for me, and I don&#39;t want to mess with customizing the framework for sure...</p>
<p>Besides all that, is there a newer, better way than to just create a custom proxy like this?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
