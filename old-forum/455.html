In version 2.1 I am adding a ToArray() method to the BrokenRulesCollection class, so you can easily get a string array with the descriptions using that method.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jokiz replied on Sunday, June 25, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>Good idea.
