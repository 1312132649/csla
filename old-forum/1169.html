If so, the database is the logical solution.<br><br>Or do you want the more typical smart client experience, where this sort of thing is per-user and per-machine? In which case the special Application Data folder is the right location - or you could use IsolatedStorage, which is perhaps even simpler.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>I'd like to go the 'more typical' route, so if its per user / per machine, that's the method I'll pursue.<br><br>Either way, is a business object needed?&nbsp; Part of me says yes, but another part says saving searches is purely a UI artificate.. although a similar web UI down the road may expose something similar.. <br><br>Thanks for the feedback<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ChristianPena replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>Don't forget to give them the ability to remove searches from their list to avoid clutter.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2>Oh defainately.&nbsp; I wouldn't be adding searches either unless they explicitely told the app to do so.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RangerGuy replied on Monday, September 11, 2006</h2>If your users can move from machine to machine....I would think they would expect see the same settings. Kinda of like a roaming profile. I would save the criteria in the DB. That way further down the road you could utilize it with the web app as well.

The user creates a query on the web client and the next time they log in to the windows client they have the same query and vise versa.. kind of a cool feature.

We purchaced the Infragistics suite as well :) Haven't done much with it yet... but were really excited to use them.
