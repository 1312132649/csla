<P>I have 5 combos on a form, and the first one is the filter for the others. I have already written the event handlers that are activated when the user selects an item on the first combo, and my question is, how can I hook into the same events when the form opens and the first combo is bound? The SelectedValueChanged event isn't fired when databinding to the SelectedValue.</P>
<P>Any help would greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>thanks</P>

<P>Thanks for the suggestion. I'm trying to fit this into the MVC I've got going here. The SelectedIndexChanged event works fine when an item is selected, so I was hoping to trigger the same events when the data is bound on the filter combobox so that I could use the same event handler for both. But for some reason the databinding doesn't always trigger the event.</P>

<P>I prefer to have the event handler call another method that actually does the work.&nbsp; That way, I can have the same logic invoked by multiple handlers with a minimum of bother.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Thursday, August 09, 2007</h2><P>I understand what you are saying, and I agree.</P>
<P>This is what happens, when a user selects an item from the filter combo:</P>
<P>SelectedIndexChanged event is fired (UI) and the handler (controller) retrieves the data and returns the objects back to the UI via an (controller) event. </P>
<P>So I thought, since I had this nice pattern working, I could hook into it in when the form load and the data is loaded and bound, and get the initializition using the same logic as the combo SelectedIndexChanged event.</P>
<P>I'm trying to steer clear of calling the controller directly.</P>
