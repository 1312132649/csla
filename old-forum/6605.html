<P>When I load the form and don't pass in the BO, it creates a new, empty BO and binds the form to it (using the BindingDataSource).&nbsp; My BO has a handful of validation rules including a couple StringRequired rules.&nbsp; These fields are empty by default.&nbsp; As a result, when the form is loaded, I am immediately greeted with the blinking exclamation point telling me that an error exists.&nbsp; I shouldn't see this until I try to do something that will cause validation to occur.</P>
<P>I can't figure out what is triggering validation on my BO when the form first loads.&nbsp; Any ideas?</P>

<OL>
<LI>Devise a property that returns true/false depending on whether you want these rules enforced (based off IsNew and anything else)</LI>
<LI>Create a rule that manually short circuits based on that property value</LI>
<LI>Add this stop-if-new rule at priority -1</LI></OL>
<P>This will prevent any "real" rules from running if the object shouldn't evaluate those rules.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
