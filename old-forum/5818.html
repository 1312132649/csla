<P>My thoughts are is you have to sync data and the project files which hold the business objects, that this could be difficult to manage. I just wanted to give this more thought and research and I am wondering if anyone can point&nbsp;to some good resources.</P>
<P>Basically, I&nbsp;would like more insight into what happens after you build your business objects and&nbsp;how hard is it to expand it to several locations. </P>
