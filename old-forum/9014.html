<p>We&#39;ve been getting this error for the past few days - ever since we deployed a test version for the users, actually: <b>TCP error code 10048: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted </b></p>
<p>This does not seem to happen on our development machines for some reason.&nbsp; I&#39;ve looked at various threads on StackOverflow and MSDN, but haven&#39;t found anything there that could possibly help since here it is really CSLA that&#39;s taking care of all the plumbing.</p>
<p>Anyone has an idea as to what we can check - be it on the client or server side - to resolve this?&nbsp; The Net.TCP service is deployed as a Windows Service (the server is Windows Server 2003).</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Michel</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>You might need to use fiddler or&nbsp;other network monitor app to see what&#39;s going on. I assume you are using WCF? It is probably something to do with WCF or your service implementation that&#39;s causing a port conflict.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MichelRenaud replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>Hi Rockford,</p>
<p>Yes, we are using WCF (though I&#39;ve renamed it internally to &quot;WTF&quot;, which I find more suiting - hehe).&nbsp; Alright so most likely it&#39;s the WCF configuration section, or the way the Windows Service was configured.&nbsp; We did our best with this stuff - it&#39;s not easy finding good answers to questions about WCF.&nbsp; What really sucks trying to troubleshoot the problem is that to test any solution, we have to redeploy the service and have the users try it since it doesn&#39;t happen on our own machines.</p>
<p>If anyone has suggestions for specific areas to focus on, please feel free to reply.&nbsp; We&#39;re using CSLA 3.0, by the way (if that makes any difference.)</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />MIchel</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jaans replied on Tuesday, July 09, 2013</h2><p>Hi Michel</p>
<p>We&#39;ve just started to see this error in production for a new ASP.NET MVC based website front-end, which calls to a remote CSLA data portal host on another server using WCF Proxy over NET TCP.</p>
<p>The errors are happening on the client side (not server side) for us. Still no clue as to why yet...</p>
<p>Please post if anyone has any past experiences with this.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jaans replied on Tuesday, July 09, 2013</h2><p>These links might relate:</p>
