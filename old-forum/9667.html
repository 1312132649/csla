I download source code at apress. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Book-Page 516-ValidRole Method in Assignment Class:</strong></p>
<p>Public Function ValidRole(Of T As IHoldRoles)( _<br />&nbsp; ByVal target As T, ByVal e As RuleArgs) As Boolean<br />&nbsp; Dim role As Integer = target.Role<br />&nbsp; If RoleList.GetList().ContainsKey(role) Then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return True&nbsp;</p>
<p>Else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.Description = &quot;Role must be in RoleList&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return False<br />&nbsp; End If<br />End Function</p>
<p><strong>But source code is :</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Public Function ValidRole( _<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ByVal target As Object, ByVal e As RuleArgs) As Boolean<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim role As Integer = CType(target, IHoldRoles).Role<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If RoleList.GetList.ContainsKey(role) Then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return True<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.Description = &quot;Role must be in RoleList&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return False<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Function</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, October 24, 2010</h2><p>Both approaches are valid, so you can go either way. In a sense, you are getting a bonus because you now have examples of the two valid implementations :)</p>
<p>The answer to your actual question may not be satisfying, but here it is. Writing a book of this size is ridiculously complex, and prose is extremely difficult to debug (I&#39;m still waiting for the &#39;compile&#39; menu option in Word). While the author, reviewers and publisher try their best to keep everything perfectly in sync, the reality is that the book is written over a period of months, and then it takes months for the publishing process itself to occur, and then things like source code are put on the web site.</p>
<p>If this is the only thing out of sync I&#39;d be shocked.</p>
<p>In any case, you can find much more current code on www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx - the 2008 code is, of course, over 2 years old at this point, so it just represents a snapshot in time from back then. A lot of interesting things have happened since 2008 - Silverlight, ASP.NET MVC, Windows Phone 7, etc.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>volkans80 replied on Wednesday, October 27, 2010</h2><p>I am reading book and I am rewriting Project Tracker myself. I am adding source code to my project&nbsp;where source code is&nbsp;not in&nbsp;book. But there is some errors with this method. </p>
<p>For above&nbsp;example when write&nbsp;this&nbsp;code then error occur: Error&nbsp;9&nbsp;Overload resolution failed because no accessible &#39;AddRule&#39; can be called with these arguments</p>
<p>Maybe I don&#39;t know how to write this code for your&nbsp;code in book.</p>
<p>Protected Overrides Sub AddBusinessRules()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ValidationRules.AddRule(AddressOf Assignment.ValidRole, RoleProperty)</p>
<p>End Sub</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, October 27, 2010</h2><p>If you are using the generic ValidRole implementation, then you need to use the generic AddRule() overload too. This is where the actual type information originates so it can flow into the rule.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>volkans80 replied on Wednesday, October 27, 2010</h2><p>Thanks for your replies. I think I must study more.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
