In the code behind just wire up an listener to the PropertyChanged event for that property...<br>Cheers<br>Anthony<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, November 13, 2008</h2>I setup an event trigger on the control, but that does the animation when the form initially loads as well.&nbsp; So yes, my next step is to hook into the property changed on the BO.&nbsp; I'm trying to find a pure Xaml way of doing this though.. :-)<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
