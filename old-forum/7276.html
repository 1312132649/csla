Has anybody upgraded and what issues have you faced in ActiveObjects? Not sure if there's a new version of ActiveObjects I should be using. <br /><br />So far it looks like DataPortal_Create is not being called prior to retrieving property names to use in OnPropertyChanged method in ActiveBusinessBase.<br /><br />Thank you.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 16, 2009</h2><P>To my knowledge ActiveObjects hasn't been updated for several years. The author of ActiveObjects moved (not just jobs, but literally half-way around the world) and I don't think he's an active member of the CSLA community any longer.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Thursday, July 16, 2009</h2><P>Hi,</P>
