<p>CSLA 4 beta 3 is now <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">available for 
download</a>.</p>
<p>This is the final beta release of CSLA 4. All work going forward will be 
focused on stabilization, bug fixing and updating sample applications. My 
current plan is to do a release candidate&nbsp;the week of July 5, and final release 
around July 15.</p>
<p>New features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved ASP.NET MVC 2 support</li>
<li>Server exceptions can be altered by your IDataPortalExecptionInspector 
implementation</li>
<li>ERLB now has a default AddNewCore() implementation</li>
<li>Numerous other bug fixes and minor tweaks based on user feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=3852b8d8-e2f7-4277-b77e-bf375125b6c9">change 
log</a> for a list of important changes in this release.</p>
<p>Given the short timeline until release, it is really important that anyone 
considering using CSLA 4 in the near future help out by using the framework and 
identifying any bugs or stability issues. In short, I need your help to make 
this a successful release.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
