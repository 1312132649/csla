<P><BR>I am new to CSLA.&nbsp; I would like to leverate the CslaXml template for generating my business objects.</P>
<P>Basic tech design is as follows:</P>
<P>Data Layer consists of Data Objects that are managed using NHibernate.</P>
<P>Business Layer consists of Business Objects using CSLA Framework.</P>
<P>I am looking for some resources to better understand the MySample.xml structure and to know what my options are for generating a template.</P>
<P>The key difference is that my objects will be populated by obtaining Data Transfer Objects from the Data Layer rather than hitting a database.</P>
<P>If anyone can offer instruction (or where to find it) I would be most grateful.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>
