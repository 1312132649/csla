<p>I don&#39;t know what I did, but suddenly my design surface looks like the program is executing.&nbsp; The only way I can make all controls appear is to mess with my Converter code to make it ineffective.&nbsp; I have searched everywhere in Options, but I see nothing pertinent.&nbsp; My 1100 page VS2010 book is just as useless.&nbsp; I cannot understand how this behavior would suddenly change after over a year&#39;s use.</p>
<p>I wonder if anybody has an answer to this puzzle.</p>

<p>&quot;By always forcing visiblity of hidden/collapsed control we made it impossible to do perform layout tasks because they would not really reflect the runtime behavior....... Keep in mind that these hidden controls will remain selectable from the XAML tab as well as the Document Outline.<br />Marco Goertz \ Sr. Dev Lead \ WPF/SL Designer \ Expression-Cider \ Microsoft&quot;</p>
<p>Does that even make any sense!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;A designer where you cannot even see the controls you are placing on it!!!&nbsp; I do spend most of my time in xaml, but I also want to glance at what my UI will look like to the user.</p>
