<p>For reasons that baffle me, I&#39;m also having a hard time convincing the group that we should stay with CSLA at all, even though we&#39;ve been very successful with it.&nbsp; The developers would rather re-invent the wheel I guess.&nbsp; I am hoping that if I can come up with a good plan to transition us to the newest version, I can put that sort of debate to rest as well.</p>
<p>Any advice you can give somebody in my position would be helpful.&nbsp; The whole issue of upgrading CSLA in general has been a pretty hot topic around here.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Tuesday, May 11, 2010</h2><p>I believe migrating from 3.8.3 to 4.0 is a much easier upgrade then from 2.1.4 to 3.8.3.&nbsp; In any case upgrading to 4.0 would be much much easier than striking out building&nbsp;their own.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t upgrade any apps to 4.0 yet, but I have been writing a new app in 4.0 and the changes aren&#39;t to big.&nbsp; The biggest changes are with authorization and validation.&nbsp; But these changes are logical in nature, are powerful,&nbsp;and don&#39;t take much of a learning curve.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 11, 2010</h2><p>I think it is true that, assuming you are using 3.8 style coding structures, it is really not that hard to move to 4.</p>
<p>If you are still using 2.x coding structures (which you can in 3.8), then moving to 4 will be a little harder because you&#39;ll have to at least start using RegisterProperty() to register your properties. But even then, most of the old 2.x coding structures remain mostly intact&nbsp;- just tweaked to use the property info fields instead of string literals for property names.</p>
<p>It is true that all your ValidationRules.AddRule() and AuthorizationRules method calls are affected. But the changes are mechanical - it is just a bunch of repetative grunt work to make the changes. Not that I am saying this doesn&#39;t take some time - but it isn&#39;t like you have to rethink anything - it is just syntactic code changes.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 11, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>frankhoffy<br></b>

<p>That kind of puzzles me as well - quite often.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for me to end up talking to customers who have built, or are building, a framework for their app dev work. If they are using objects at all (which most are), their framework looks like CSLA from 2003 when it was extremely simple and didn&#39;t do all the stuff people really wanted it to do. In other words, they&#39;ve identified the low-hanging fruit and solved the easy problems, but haven&#39;t gotten far enough to realize just how deep the rabbit hole really goes.</p>
<p>Last week I was working with a firm like this, and they needed to do some object mapping work. Fortunately I was able to point them at DataMapper and Csla.Reflection to get some ideas on how to solve their problem. But it in my mind this was a darkly humorous situation, since they were spending hours and hours of time reinventing something CSLA has been doing for years.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
