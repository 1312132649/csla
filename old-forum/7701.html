One of the thing i made sure was to remove bindingsourcerefresh controls from my forms and add them again. It seems that all controls are working the same as before but smartdate doesnt work as supposed. When i enter the value "." i&nbsp; get the current date only after i update another control. It seems that the problem only appears with smartdate! Other controls seem to be fine<br><br>I am using devexpress controls, should this have anything to do with it? I had no problem before. <br>The bindingsource controls are the same. What could be wrong?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 29, 2009</h2><P>Can you try with standard controls (even a small test) to help identify if the problem is bindingsourcerefresh or unique to the devexpress controls?</P>
<P>The bindingsourcerefresh control changed in 3.5 to address some bugs with null value handling and some other issues. That was a couple years ago, and to my knowledge it has been working fine since that time. I don't believe the control has been changed since then.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pandelaras replied on Wednesday, September 30, 2009</h2>This is the most weird thing. I created another project using the same csla object. The other project was a simple windows forms project with a few controls binded to an editableroot object (through a bindingsource). Readvaluesonchange is set to true and the desired code appears below the bindingsource inside the designer.<br><br>Me.MY_ERBindingSource.DataSource = GetType(testbindingsourcerefresh1.MY_ER)<br>Me.BindingSourceRefresh1.SetReadValuesOnChange(Me.MY_ERBindingSource, True)<br><br>I still dont get the desired result! Is it possible that i am adding the bindingsourcerefresh the wrong way? Being lazy i copy paste it from another project of mine .... Could this be it?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Wednesday, September 30, 2009</h2>i was having same issue.. del and add again, it will work.. chk this post<br /><br />http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/34367.aspx<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pandelaras replied on Wednesday, September 30, 2009</h2>I did delete it and add it again. I even created a new form with new controls. Perhaps i am adding it wrong? Cause deleting i am sure i am doing it ok :)<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, September 30, 2009</h2><P>I've logged this issue as a bug</P>

<P>But I don't know when I'll get to this - almost certainly not for 2-3 weeks at best (and that's optimistic).</P>
<P>I know it is hard to debug Windows Forms components - but if you need this resolved sooner than later, you may want to dig in and give it a try.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pandelaras replied on Wednesday, September 30, 2009</h2>&nbsp;Thank you for your time Rocky. My main concern was that i found no obvious solution. As long as one can be found, i will be fine :)<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pandelaras replied on Wednesday, September 30, 2009</h2>i am attaching a test project that the bindingsourcerefresh appears not to be working<br><br>http://www.easy-share.com/1907958802/testbindingsourcerefresh1.zip<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, October 01, 2009</h2>Hi, <br><br>The reason BindingSourcerefesh is failing is because you are missing a setting in the designer file. This should have been set automatically as: <br><br>Me.bindingSourceRefresh1.Host = Me<br><br>If Host is not set properly the bindingSourceRefresh will not hook into events on the BindingSources and so not do anything useful. <br><br>You may also set Me.bindingSourceRefresh1.Host = Me after InitializeComponents in your forms constructor. <br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pandelaras replied on Saturday, October 03, 2009</h2>Indeed that fixed it! Thank you!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
