The specific settings and configuration may be different, but the limits are still there.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m just wondering why I haven&#39;t run into the limits using the tcp binding with&nbsp;my .NET&nbsp;object&nbsp;as I did with the http binding and the SL version of the same object.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;two services, one with a tcp endpoint and the other an http endpoint.&nbsp; They both expose the same object (one .NET, the other SL).&nbsp; When testing the http endpoint I quickly ran into the size limits and had to implement compression following the e-book example.&nbsp; However, I haven&#39;t had to use the compression classes for my .NET object using the tcp binding, which basically deals with the exact same data.&nbsp; Could someone provide some guidance on why this might be the case?&nbsp; My main concern is that I don&#39;t want to roll out something into production when things appear to be okay as is, and then find I hit a limit with my WPF UI that uses the tcp binding.&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
