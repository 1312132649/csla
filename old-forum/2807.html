<P>I'm assuming youv'e verified that the&nbsp;input data is ok, and that&nbsp;SmartDecimal works correctly outside the RDL&nbsp;environment.</P>
<P>I haven't tried using BOs in reporting services yet, but I'm curious if you are having the same problem with SmartDate?</P>
<P>Could it be a presentation width problem, in that the display width isn't wide enought to display?&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, May 01, 2007</h2>Yes, prior to getting the report, it is being displayed on the screen.&nbsp; The same BOs that are being displayed are used as the reports datasource.<br><br>I haven't used smartdate in these reports at all yet, but I imagine it would be a problem.&nbsp; I don't think its a width problem, because it would simply be clipped from what I could see.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Tuesday, May 01, 2007</h2>It's possible that the RDL file cannot find the business object library.&nbsp; Depending upon your setup, it might be running on a totally different computer from the database or the webserver.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, May 01, 2007</h2>Hmm, it could be that is the case.&nbsp; Part of me would be suprised, because the report is actually embedded into the business object library.&nbsp; Part of me wouldn't be though.. i'll see if I can't get it to find the assemblies.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, May 02, 2007</h2>I ran into issues where Csla wasn't trusted, so rather than trying to figure out what else I must do to make the report see Csla, I found a workaround.<br><br>If I add .ToString in the expression, I can get the value fine.&nbsp; Using CDec, I can convert that value so that the report can format it.&nbsp; Finally, I needed the Iif statement to simply return an empty string if ToString returns the empty string.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
