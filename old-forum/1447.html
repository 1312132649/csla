Some properties are set by the users, others are the responsibility of the programmer.&nbsp; Since code generation creates rules for every property of an object, my standard ritual has been to remove the rules that have nothing to do with user input - and yet I may neglect to initialize them just as easily, thereby breaking the "Test"&nbsp;but not the&nbsp;"Rule".</P>
<P>A second element is the Debug Vs Release versions.&nbsp; In Debug, I ought to see a red flag when I as a programmer fail to set a property correctly, but there is no reason for my end user to see it when running the Release version.</P>
<P>In other words, instead of creating large bunches of Test batteries checking Properties, how about keeping all of the auto-generated tests intact, but&nbsp;separating them into Debug and non-Debug types?</P>
<P>Is anyone doing something similar?&nbsp; I don't believe this is something that the Framework needs to necessarily implement.</P>
