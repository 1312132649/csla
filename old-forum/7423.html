Here is the use case.  Have a list of items to print in a grid.  The act of "printing" means changing the status and dates, etc for an item.  The list is loaded by a particular type.  Each item that is marked in the list to print is given the same print job number as well.<br /><br />My thought is that the list needs to be the root and needs to be editable for save, so ERL and the items should be editable root objects since they need to handle their own save and don't have a parent.  Or is the "list" their parent and they should be editable children?<br /><br />It is always so much easier when I have a singular root BO with children.  I have a hard time with the lists that have no parent.<br /><br />Thanks. <br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Saturday, August 08, 2009</h2>The way that I look at it is, the list is the child ONLY when it is contained within another root level object otherwise it is the root for all of it's content objects. <br /><br />The other thing to think about is, do you want developers to be able to call Save() on each object on the list independent of each other, or will the user hit a single button to save/print all the records on the list? I am assuming the later, in which case it is just a normal list with editable children.<br /><br />Remember the editable root list is designed really only to accomdate direct editing from a grid, with immediate save.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
