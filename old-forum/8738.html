All DataMapper does is use reflection and other tricks so you write one line of code to copy a bunch of property values instead of writing one line of code for each property value.</p>
<p>I often have code that doesn&#39;t use DataMapper at all. Or that uses DataMapper to copy simple properties, along with code to copy a few other properties that are more complex.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
