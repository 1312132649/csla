<P>Our prototype is taking shape and we have decided to use the CSLA V2.1.4 for our project. At the same time we have also decided to use Infragistics controls for the front-end.</P>
<P>I have done a search of this Forum for previous questions but it doesn't answer my question. But I understand I should be looking to use CSLA V3.0 instead as this has some bug fixes in the databinding area.&nbsp; So, my question is:</P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff>Can I databind the business objects with Infragistics controls in the same way I can with the Microsoft controls?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff>Has anyone done this, if so can you tell me how? Are there any gotchas?</FONT></P>
<P>Thanks for reading.</P>

<P>I'm still new to this and trying to learn as much as I can.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>elfstoneUK replied on Friday, November 16, 2007</h2><P>ajj3085, thanks for your reply.</P>
<P>Could you tell me how <EM>exactly</EM> to do this please? I'm new to Infragistics and the CSLA.</P>
<P>What I usually&nbsp;do for Windows&nbsp;is :</P>
<P>1. Create the BO</P>
<P>2. From Data Sources (in VS 2005) drill down to find the BO.</P>
<P>3. Select (turn off what I don't require) and drag and drop the object onto the&nbsp;WinForm/User control</P>
<P>4. Test</P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff>What is the procedure with Infragistics?&nbsp; How does the UltraDataSource fit into this?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff>Any help is welcome? <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /></FONT></P>

I shall try this tomorrow (when in work).

<P>First congratulations on choosing Infragistics.&nbsp; I started using them years ago and have been very pleased.&nbsp; I don't want to presume anything but I can't stress enough how important it is that you go through their on demand training course.&nbsp; You can purchase it directly on their site.&nbsp; infragistics.com.&nbsp; I completed both the ASP.Net and Win.Net versions.&nbsp; The documentation alone that accompanies the training is worth the cost.&nbsp; Its only a few hundred dollars anyway.&nbsp; It will save you lots of hours.&nbsp; I can't believe I didn't do it sooner.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now if Active Reports would do the same...........</P>
<P>Good Luck.</P>
