I was curious and did a quick test to see if you could open the DSN once with OdbcConnection and gather enough information to then open a SQLConnection and forgot about Odbc.<br><br>Once the OdbcConnection is open you can read its DataSource property which turns out to be the Windows name of the server. In my case that is resolvable but it wouldn't be if it was on a remote network. You probably want the tcp/ip host name or ip number. Unfortunately I couldn't see that anywhere.<br><br>Cheers<br>Ross<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, April 18, 2007</h2><P>"Are there any disadvantages here?"</P>
<P>Of course there are.</P>
<P>OLEDB is slower than SqlClient. It is not optimized for SQL Server. There may be some advanced tasks which you can't perform. Standard queries should work fine.</P>
<P>That restriction is really silly. There is no reason that they can't use both techniques. ODBC for those apps that talk to the DB separate from yours. And SqlClient for yours.</P>
