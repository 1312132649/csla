<P>I read in the book that we use "Factory Methods" like MyCar.GetNewCar() or MyCar.GetCar(1). So that we can control how our BO's are created and fetched etc. Which I really like, but I notice that in the&nbsp;ReadOnlyInfo Objects we use constructors that accept either values or a datareader.</P>
<P>Is it because the constructor is marked as internal? What if we want to use this Info object as more than a child of a list. What if we want to use it as a light wieght way of displaying the info of a single BO?</P>
<P>Would it be a acceptable design descion to create&nbsp;public factory method as well like</P>
<P>MyCarInfo.GetCarInfo(MyCarGuid);</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom Cooley replied on Monday, July 24, 2006</h2>Sounds like the behavior you are describing is a ReadOnlySwitchable. The public factory method that accepts a unique id is a root object behavior. Personally, I think this seems like a reasonable design if your application calls for it.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, July 25, 2006</h2>Yes, the only reason the constructors may take DataReader is because they are marked internal, and thus the UI never knows about this.&nbsp; You can do things internally that you wouldn't allow publicly for the sake of efficency.&nbsp; The values vs. datareader is simply to show you can create internal objects either way.<br><br>Personally I NEVER expose constructors, even internally... all objects which are children get created via internal factory methods.&nbsp; Mainly I do this for consistency.<br><br>I think it'd be ok to load a car via guid.&nbsp; There needs to be some way to load a root object after all.<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>OpticTygre replied on Tuesday, July 25, 2006</h2><P>Isn't that the point of having the GetObject functions in the info classes, like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Dim myCar as Car = myCarInfo.GetCar</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom Cooley replied on Tuesday, July 25, 2006</h2>Yes, when you need to switch from viewing lightweight data to editing object details.<br><br>I think RangerGuy's question was whether or not it is acceptable to allow a xxxInfo class that is typically a read only child behave also like a read only root (therefore becoming switchable).<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
