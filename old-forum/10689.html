<p class="MsoNormal">We are developing an ASP.NET MVC 3 application using CSLA in
3-tier remoting mode using WCF communication between the external facing hosted
app computer and behind the firewall app server computer. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What is the
recommended best practice to secure the communication between the tiers? I&rsquo;ve
read older documentation (including Rocky&rsquo;s CSLA 2008 book) that recommends certificate
authentication using Chain Trust. Is that still best practice? If you do
certificate authentication, is creating a custom UserNamePasswordValidator
necessary or recommended for added security?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Any thoughts or example articles on securing 3-tiers would
be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thank-you.</p>

<p>Surely you&#39;d use that between the browser and your web server.</p>
<p>Between the web server and the app server most people don&#39;t use an encrypted transfer. But if you need to (due to HIPPA or something) then SSL is still the easiest answer. Otherwise between your servers you can use x.509 certificates.</p>
<p>See the WCF security guidance book on CodePlex for information about these and other options.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
