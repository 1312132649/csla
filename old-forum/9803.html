<p>The app is more or less simple CRUD operations...and for the most part, I&#39;ve got it down.</p>
<p>However, a few things confuse me:</p>
<p>I&#39;m inheriting from ViewModel&lt;T&gt; in my viewmodels.&nbsp; When I call this.Save(), everything works fine. However, when I call this.Delete()...nothing happens. I got delete to work by creating a Delete factory method in my BO and calling the dp.BeginDelete method. Is this the correct way to do this?</p>
<p>Also, in order to delete i&#39;m calling &quot;BeginRefresh(&quot;DeleteFactoryMethod&quot;, params)&quot; from my viewmodel...and in the factory method&#39;s dp.BeginDelete, i&#39;m using a SingleCriteria object. How can I pass in more than 1 parameter to the DataPortal_Delete method? </p>
<p>On the non silverlight side, I just create a custom criteria object...but on the Silverlight side this won&#39;t seem to work...it appears as though I have to use &quot;SingleCriteria&quot;? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
