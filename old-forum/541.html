How do I create Them?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 07, 2006</h2><P>The first, and most important, thing to remember about inheritance is that it should only be used to gain BEHAVIOR, not DATA.</P>
<P>The Animal, Mammal, Dog example, and similar examples, are really terrible. They are used in introductory object-orientation classes to teach the basic idea of inheritance, but they have no use in the real world - and in fact are very destructive examples.</P>
<P>Why? Because they focus on inheriting attributes (data) rather than behaviors.</P>
<P>The real question SHOULD be, what behaviors are at the Animal level? What do all animals have in common in terms of behavior? Probably just that they have a start and end to their life. All animals are mortal.</P>
<P>Then, what are all the behaviors in common across all Mammals? This would include the concept of being born, and consuming mother's milk, and growing fur/hair. These are the unique behaviors of a mammal.</P>
<P>Now there is no doubt that you need some extra attributes/data to implement the behaviors of Mammal&nbsp;- but it is all about the behavior, not about the data!! And this distinction is almost never made when using these flimsy examples for inheritance.</P>
<P>And what's even worse&nbsp;is that these examples totally ignore the key concept of a use case (or story). What is the purpose/mission/responsibility of your Dog class? What is the user trying to do with it? Is it merely responsible for allowing the user to enter valid data about a dog? Or is it part of a business process that is simulating the life of a dog? Or is it a read-only object designed to display data about a dog? The point is, these examples never come with any business domain context - so there's no way to design or implement them, because no one knows that they are suppose to actually <EM>do!</EM></P>
<P>I know this isn't the answer you were looking for, and I don't mean to put you off from OO design. But you need to realize that your question can't be answered in any meaningful way - at least within the context of CSLA .NET - because CSLA .NET is designed to enable behavioral objects.</P>
<P>I think someone already provided the trivial answer:</P>
<P>Public MustInherit Class Animal(Of T As Animal)<BR>&nbsp; Inherits Csla.BusinessBase(Of T)</P>
<P>Public MustInherit Class Mammal(Of T As Mammal)<BR>&nbsp; Inherits Animal(Of T)</P>
<P>Public Class Dog<BR>&nbsp; Inherits Mammal(Of Dog)</P>
<P>But again, this is pretty meaningless, as it doesn't convey meaning within a use case and may not be at all what is needed to solve the business problem.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lprada replied on Sunday, July 09, 2006</h2><P>thank you rocky, may be a more value example was my real need Person, Employee and RuralEmployee but i try to get a answer in a more general way, because I didn't understand how to do inheritance with your framework. Now I do. Thank you again, and I am very sorry about my English, I am form Argentina and I speak Spanish.</P>
