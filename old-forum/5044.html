<P>Can you explain why FieldData has a single property named IsDirty that Implements both IsDirty and IsSelfDirty from ITrackStatus? Since they are different concepts I would have expected 2 separate properties in FieldData - one for each.</P>

The distinction between the two concepts is useful to UI developers, and perhaps business object developers, but is not meaningful within CSLA itself - only IsDirty (the state of the object graph) matters.</P>
<P>If you need that distinction for some reason - because you are using IFieldData objects directly in your code, then you'll need to provide your own IFieldData implementation.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>robert_m replied on Thursday, July 03, 2008</h2>While we're at this dirty subject, does anyone know if it's possible to get&nbsp; property level IsDirty status for a registered property from a BusinessBase inherited class ? It would be useful in some scenarios (debugging, for instance) to know not just if the whole object is dirty but if a specific property is dirty...<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>robert_m replied on Thursday, July 03, 2008</h2>I found it (in 3.5.1). FieldDataManager has a new method:<br><br>public bool IsFieldDirty(IPropertyInfo propertyInfo)<br><br>Should have read the changelog.....<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
