<P>Xtra Reports:&nbsp; While the price was right and you can get source code, it's all too obvious after working with this product for a few months that it's a relatively immature product as far as features and ease of use.&nbsp; There's great newsgroup support, but all too often it's only to say "we're planning to add that feature in the future."&nbsp; One of the big attractions for me, the end-user designer, is really a no-show because doing anything significant would require the user to&nbsp;use scripting.&nbsp; Since the report designer uses the BindingSource object, it handles CSLA collections easily.</P>
<P>SQL Reporting Services:&nbsp; I finally verified just a month or so ago that there is really two "flavors" of this product.&nbsp; I dismiss the SQL Server based&nbsp;option outright as I never want my entire application's reporting to be tied to that kind of server requirement.&nbsp; Nice try Microsoft, but no thanks.&nbsp; There is, however, a local (visual studio) version of the technology that doesn't require SQL server.&nbsp; I have not investigated it much, but expect it suffers from the same immaturity issues I believe plagues the server version (and Xtra Reports).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what the capabilities are for printing from CSLA business objects.</P>
<P>Crystal Reports:&nbsp; A very powerful and feature-rich reporting system.&nbsp; The biggest drawback at this point seems to be that automating reports such that they are delivered without human initiation requires rather expensive licensing.&nbsp; I don't know what the capabilities are for printing from CSLA business objects.</P>
<P>I guess my&nbsp;bottom-line question at this point is if there are still reasons to continue to avoid Crystal?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, July 07, 2006</h2>I haven't used it much yet, but I have built a 'report' using ReportViewer (FYI, there is very little difference between a local report and a server report; the reporting technology is the same either way though).&nbsp; Its worked very well, and I don't need any extra licensing to deploy it.&nbsp; Also, using client reports doesn't tie you at all to Sql server; server reports are the only option that would lock you in.<br><br>The nice part was that I could use a Csla object as the reports datasource; I believe you can do this with the newest Crystal as well.. but it seems like they offer much the same functionality.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Monday, July 10, 2006</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>ajj3085:</strong></div><div>I haven't used it much yet, but I have built a 'report' using ReportViewer (FYI, there is very little difference between a local report and a server report; the reporting technology is the same either way though).&nbsp; Its worked very well, and I don't need any extra licensing to deploy it.&nbsp; Also, using client reports doesn't tie you at all to Sql server; server reports are the only option that would lock you in.<BR><BR>The nice part was that I could use a Csla object as the reports datasource; I believe you can do this with the newest Crystal as well.. but it seems like they offer much the same functionality.<BR><BR>HTH<BR>Andy<BR></div></BLOCKQUOTE></P>
<P>Have you done some of the more complex stuff like multi-level grouping, subtotaling, subreports, etc.?&nbsp; </P>
<P>One of the big&nbsp;things that seemed to be missing with the ReportViewer/ReportingServices&nbsp;product (from the really high-level overview webinars I watched anyway) was the way you can manipulate the report at runtime via the DOM like in Crystal or the other products mentioned.&nbsp; For example, let's say I have a criteria form and then want to change the subtitle on the document based on that criteria.</P>
<P>This is what I remember liking about Crystal - it's a very elegant gui report designer but you had the raw access when you needed it.&nbsp; The other options seem to emphasize one thing at the expense of the other.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Monday, July 10, 2006</h2><P>Another product to consider is Active Reports.&nbsp; I tried it about a year ago, but never got the opportunity to make any serious progress with it&nbsp;- we got sidetracked off reporting.&nbsp; I know it was mentioned on the old forums as well.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Monday, July 10, 2006</h2>I looked hard at Active Reports when I was evaluating Xtra.&nbsp; It's even worse in being a primitive developers tool.&nbsp; I had to write code just to get "page X of Y" to display on a page!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
