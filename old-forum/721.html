I have a LineItem class, which represents a single line item in the order / quote.&nbsp; Each line item may contain one or more Products, which have basically the same information as a line item.&nbsp; I've gotten the indenting to the same level for both, so it appears on the UI as if there is no difference between the two.&nbsp; The only part I need now is to NOT have the column headers repeat after the Products of the first line item and before the second line item.<br><br>How do I turn those off?<br><br>Thanks<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CaymanIslandsCarpediem replied on Tuesday, July 25, 2006</h2>If memory serves, you'll need to get the band (UltraGridBand) of the level you don't want to show column headers for.&nbsp; Then the band should expose a property called "ColHeadersVisible" that you can set to false.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, July 25, 2006</h2>I found that property on the band, but it hides the column headers completely.&nbsp; I only want to hide the ones that occur in the 'middle' of the grid.<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jlazanowski replied on Tuesday, July 25, 2006</h2><P>Andy,</P>
<P>Cayman was correct. The column headers are configured for each band that you're working with. I'm making an assumption here but sounds like you have a parent band and two child bands that have the same data. </P>
<P>The easiest way to do this would be to turn the column headers off in the InitializeLayout event of the grid </P>
<P>something like </P>
<P>e.Layout.Bands[2].ColHeadersVisable = false;</P>
<P>You can also call it by the band name if you're unsure of the index</P>
<P>e.Layout.Bands["MyBand"].ColHeadersVisable = false;</P>
<P>HTH,<BR><BR>Justin</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, July 25, 2006</h2>Justin,<br><br>I don't have three bands, only two.&nbsp; The Grid displays like so:<br><br>Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnitPrice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExtPrice &lt;--- I want to keep this header<br>LineItem1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this is of type LineItem, in band 0)<br>Product1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this is in LineItem1.Products collection)<br>Product2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this is in LineItem1.Products collection)<br>Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnitPrice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExtPrice &lt;--- I just want to remove this col. header<br>

<P>I guess the point is that the column headers are setup on the specific band, thus you can only shut them off on the band. If you're getting repeating headers something probably wrong with the binding of your item(s) to the grid. </P>
<P>I do remember specifically that I emailed Infragistics about a feature request to the grid, at the time it wouldn't allow something that I wanted, I think it was multiple bands to bind to a parent band, at the time I think you could only have a 1:1 relation if the band was already a child itself, don't remember the specifics and don't know if it's an issue anymore. I've put a screen shot of what I'm talking about <A href="http://www.lazanowski.com/infragrid.jpg">here</A> so that this post makes a little more sense</P>
<P>You can also e-mail Infragistics, even if you haven't purchased the product, then will try and help you.</P>
