<p class=MsoNormal><span>I never used ADAM, but you are correct I believe.&nbsp; Simply put
your code into YourCustomPrincipal.Login method and have it populate roles and
validate the password/user name combination.&nbsp; If you look at the project
tracker Principal and Identity classes, you will see the example on how to authenticate
against SQL server.&nbsp; That is the code you need to replace with ADAM calls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
