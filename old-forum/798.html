<P>I am looking for a small and easy to understand example of how to use CLSA.Net 2.0 in a web project.</P>
<P>Something easy like a simple web page reading the first record of a table of let say NorthWind&nbsp;DB, with a save button to save the information back in the DB.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I think with a small web projet like this, I could easily try to make a second page linked on another table of the DB.</P>
<P>I am pretty sure someone already have this king of project and I hope you will share it to me.</P>
<P>I would prefer a vb.net project!!&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thank you</P>

<P>There is a demo that Rocky provides in the download section. It's called the PTracker demo and represents a relatively simple application for both Web, Windows, and Web Services client. </P>
<P>Have you tried that? </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dubem1 replied on Thursday, August 03, 2006</h2><P>Yes I did, But this demo is maybe simple for you, but not for me!!&nbsp; I think i would be easier for me to understand with a smaller demo.</P>
<P>Thank you</P>
<P>Martin</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, August 03, 2006</h2><P>Sure, I understand. </P>
<P>One thing that is nice about using the PTracker demonstraction is that the walkthrough of the underlying business objects and the reasoning for which business objects were created are discussed right in the book. So even if you skip the chapters on the framework (and the preceeding <EM>excellent</EM> chapters takling about the ideas around mobile objects), you could theoretically start out with chapter 6 (I think) and get a walkthrough of the PTracker&nbsp;(both the BO construction and the Web UI design).&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>If I had a really simple app handy I'd pass it along, but I'm afraid I don't at the moment! </P>
<P>Good luck. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dubem1 replied on Thursday, August 03, 2006</h2><P>The problem is I can't read the book.&nbsp; I speak French, my English is not enough good to read this large book.&nbsp; So I would like to try to understand by tracing a small example.</P>
<P>Thank you</P>

<P>Maybe you can locate others where you are and form a study group to help each other out?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dubem1 replied on Tuesday, August 15, 2006</h2><P>Thank you</P>
<P>It's a nice idea.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But since then if someone got a small web page example (reading and updating). I would be very please</P>
<P>Thank you</P>
