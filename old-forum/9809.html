<p dir="ltr">I&#39;m having a problem with ViewModel from Csla.Xaml. If I create a new class from ViewModel&lt;T&gt; and T is derived from BusinessListBase, everything is OK, but if T is derived from BusinessBase when I use the Data Sources window, and create a new data source based on the ViewModel the Model property is always grayed out. If I just change the T to a BLB without any other changes to the viewmodel, recompile and open the data sources window again the Model property is OK and I can drag it onto the design surface.</p>

<p>I do think that the Model starts out grayed out, because the default is for some sort of list display, and you need to change the Data Sources window so it knows to generate a Details view for the Model property, but then it should work fine.</p>
<p>Is this CSLA 4 or 3.8?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TerryH replied on Monday, November 29, 2010</h2><p>Rocky</p>

<p>This evening I create a whole new solution and was very careful not to mix DLL versions, this time I was able to click the dropdown and select Detail, the other solutions that I created when I clicked the dropdown so that I could select Detail, the combobox wouldn&#39;t open!</p>
<p>Its CSLA 4</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick response</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
