<P>I'm trying to use the CslaDataSource control on an ASP.NET page and I just can't get the GridView to accept it.&nbsp; I'm doing exactly what I'd do with a SQLDataSource control, plus adding in the assembly/type names.&nbsp; The control inclusion is done on the page and appears to be fine.&nbsp; My actual implementation of the control and datagrid match up with the book and the sample application, as far as my eyes are seeing.</P>
<P>I'm just plain not getting anything to show up when I try to use the CslaDataSource control.&nbsp; It works great if I make a call to the target object in the Page_Load event and bind that to the gridview directly.</P>
<P>What can I look at to be sure I'm using the datasource control correctly?&nbsp; I've been fighting with this on and off&nbsp;for a couple of days.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, March 09, 2007</h2>Are you using version 2.1.4? Some major implementation changes are included in that version, specifically to make the CslaDataSource work in a reliable manner. The only remaining known issue is documented in the change log, along with a reasonable workaround. Additionally, 2.1.4 has a configuration dialog (click the Configure link in the grid's helper menu) to help make sure you get the assembly/type info correct.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, March 09, 2007</h2><P>Also, you don't mention that you are handling the SelectObject event. Read Chapter 10 for details on how to actually implement code to handle that event. And the <EM>CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</EM> has examples on how to do paging and sorting if you need those features.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mercule replied on Monday, March 12, 2007</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>

<P>I think this is the issue.&nbsp; I was reviewing your book yesterday and just about kicked myself.&nbsp; I haven't had a chance to test it, yet, but it does seem the likely culprit.</P>
<P>I'll also check out the latest version of the framework for the updates.</P>
<P>Thanks, much.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
