That works great.</p>
<p>My question is if the business object has field(s) that are selected from some list (a read only root list) what is the best practice for getting the list to the view? As far as I know there are 3 basic approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>From within the controller place the list in ViewData</li>
<li>Create html helpers that will return the list to the view</li>
<li>Create a view model that has the business object as one of its properties and create properties for and lookup list on the view model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.</p>

That way you get strong typing.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
