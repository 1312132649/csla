<p>I&#39;ve hit a brick wall and hoping someone could shed light.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got an MDI Parent and normal child forms resize fine. The problem is any child forms that inherit from a base form with a CSLA 3.7.1 implementation cannot be resized. Here is a small bare bone repro:</p>

<p>A response would be much appreciated. Even if this cant be done it&#39;d be good to know?</p>
<p>Cheers</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, February 21, 2011</h2><p>It&#39;s got to be something with your frmMaintenanceBase. <b>This has nothing to do with Csla </b></p>
<p>Inheritance is sometimes very cumbersome in WindowsForms.</p>
<p>AHA, You cannont use AutoSizeMode = GrowAndShrink.</p>
<p><i>The default value is set to <code>GrowOnly</code>. This property determines the mode by which the form automatically resizes itself and takes a value from the <code>AutoSizeMode</code></i> enumeration:
</p>
<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li> <i><code>GrowAndShrink</code> - The control grows or shrinks to fit its contents. <b>The control cannot be resized manually.  
</b></i></li>
<li> <i><code>GrowOnly</code> - The control grows as much as necessary
 to fit its contents but does not shrink smaller than the value of its 
Size property. The form can be resized, but cannot be made so small that
 any of its contained controls are hidden.
</i></li>
</ul>
</dd></dl>
<p>After changing AutoSizeMode - manual resizing works fine on my computer.</p>

Thanks for this JonnyBee, its a pity the form cant be shrunk but obviously thats by &quot;some weird&quot; design.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
