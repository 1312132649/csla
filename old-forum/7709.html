<P>Our goal would be to learn-by-example using our existing code and not high level conceptual training.&nbsp; We have a set of applications under development and are focused on implementing good unit tests with high code coverage but it has become clear that we simply don't have the experience to really know what that means or how to implement effective tests.</P>
<P>We are looking for someone with a good amount of practical experience writing unit tests.&nbsp; Knowledge and experience with mocking is required.&nbsp; (We are using Moq, btw.)</P>

<P>Thanks!</P>

<P>I would not be opposed to working with someone remote if the proposal was a good fit.&nbsp; We have access to WebEx, LiveMeeting, etc. so tele-commuting is not really an issue.</P>
