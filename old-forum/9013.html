<p>The best&nbsp; &quot;how to use&quot; information is in the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/">Core 3.8 video series</a>. </p>
<p>The Expert 2008 Business Objects book is better organized for this than the 2005 book, but is still has a lot of content about how the framework is designed.</p>
<p>The 3.0 ebook has some &quot;how it works&quot; content and some &quot;how to use&quot; content, but it does lean more toward &quot;how to use&quot;, which is what you want. The 3.0 ebook builds on the 2005 book in some very specific areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>WPF</li>
<li>WCF</li>
<li>Windows Forms (due to CSLA data binding changes to work better with Windows Forms)</li>
<li>Windows Workflow (largely obsolete since Microsoft changed WF so much in .NET 4)</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous CSLA updates/changes</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very useful if you are using those technology areas, otherwise it is probably not useful at all.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>Thanks, Rocky.&nbsp; I had previously purchased the Silverlight video series a few months ago, but haven&#39;t yet gone through it entirely.&nbsp; Is there much different beyond that since I am targeting WPF for this current project?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 01, 2010</h2><p>The Silverlight video series spends a fair amount of time covering Silverlight-specific issues, at the expense of spending time covering the use of CSLA in more detail.</p>
<p>The Core 3.8 video series spends all its time covering the use of CSLA in detail, with as little focus on any UI technology as possible. So the Core 3.8 series does go into more detail around object design, the data portal, data access, business rules, security and so forth - moreso than the Silverlight series.</p>
<p>All that said, you should be able to adapt most of the non-Silverlight concepts to any CSLA project - and WPF is the closest match to SL.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
