<P>Thank you in advance for your assistance.</P>

We ran ASPNET_REGIIS.EXE (under the WINNT\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727 directory, with a "/i" parameter, at the command line).<br><br>2. We enabled Windows integrated security in IIS.&nbsp; <br><br>The "unable to debug" error went away and the PTWeb app now runs.<br><br>-Dave<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ClaytonHoyt replied on Wednesday, April 30, 2008</h2><P><FONT face=Arial>Hi All</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>I am getting this same error but under slightly different circumstances. We are using client certificates accessed from a common access card. Because of this, we have to debug under SSL. I get this same error when using SSL but if I turn off the common access card requirements and SSL, I do not get any errors at all.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>I have tried all the above on 2 different computers and nothing helps. Oddly, if I publish the site and turn on client certs with SSL, it works fine on the staging server.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Any thoughts?</FONT></P>

<P>What is missing is the Everyone user on the PTWeb catalog in the 3.6.1 track.&nbsp;Just add that user&nbsp;under the security tab for the PTWeb catalog&nbsp;and anonymous access should be "enabled" for your website. To enable debugging check Integrated Windows Authentication&nbsp;in your IIS virtual root.</P>
<P>good luck.</P>

<P>In IE Trusted sites add localhost&nbsp; (without the http://)</P>
<P>Be sure to turn off Visual Studio and then re-start it after making this change.</P>
<P>Also, you can try to add 127.0.0.1 (the loopback address) as a trusted site.</P>
