<p>Silverlight, CSLA 3.8.x, using MVVM and after saving a model, I wasn&#39;t getting my UI updating properly.</p>
<p>A propertystatus bound to a string property which was empty and remained empty for the save was pointing at the old model (the _source value reflected the old object).&nbsp; There are other property status controls defined alongside that one that point to the new model.&nbsp; It&#39;s very peculiar.</p>
<p>Just wondering if anyone has encountered this.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 01, 2011</h2><p>This was a CSLA 4 bug, but maybe the same (or similar) thing?</p>
