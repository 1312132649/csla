<P>Sorry for the general&nbsp;subject, couldn't think of a good way to sum this up. I've found semi similar posts but nothing quite like this and I'm stuck. Can anyone advise me on a good way to handle the following situation?</P>
<P>A&nbsp;user can use my app to&nbsp;create, save, and delete&nbsp;a Form/Application. This Form is essentially owned by the user so&nbsp;it has a fairly limited&nbsp;set of&nbsp;savability rules. They can work on it, save it, and finish it later if they wish.&nbsp;At some pt the user will decide they've filled out the Form sufficiently and "submit" it to the app, giving up ownership.&nbsp;When they do this I need to check&nbsp;they're submission&nbsp;against&nbsp;a much&nbsp;more rigorous set of rules and change the state of the "owned" Form to indicate it can't be edited anymore. If their Form can't be submitted, they need to be informed as to why and retain the ability to edit their Form until its complete.</P>
<P>So far I've figured there's definitly a requirement for at least 2 separate BO's. One for the user controlled Form and one for the Submission each with thier&nbsp;own vali/auth rules.&nbsp;But before I got much further it be great to hear some ideas.</P>
<P>What would your model/collaborations look like?</P>
<P>Seems like this must have come up before and given that this forum has so many experienced professionals&nbsp;I figured&nbsp;I'd ask before reinventing/rebreaking any wheels.</P>
<P>Thanks tons for any help!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
