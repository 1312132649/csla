<p>From a 10,000 foot level, can somebody direct me as to how these are created?&nbsp; I have the entire Expression studio.&nbsp; Is that a possibility?&nbsp; Even better would be a URL or 2 that could get me started in this wide mysterious world?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#39;m a whizbang coder having&nbsp;just earned my WPF MCTS.&nbsp; However, Graphics is like Latin for me and it&#39;s getting pretty embarassing!&nbsp; Help me.....help me!</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance, and when you&#39;re as bad as me, anything is assistance.</p>

I got one of our designers from <a href="http://www.magenic.com/default.aspx?tabid=1633">Magenic Studios</a> to create it for me <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p>
<p>I know Anthony used Blend to create the design assets - but I don&#39;t know the steps that are involved, sorry.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
