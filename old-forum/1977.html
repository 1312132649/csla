<p class="MsoNormal">What do you mean it blows up?<span>&nbsp; </span>Does it consider object to be a naughty word
and bleeps it out or does it not let you post your message?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CaymanIslandsCarpediem replied on Thursday, December 14, 2006</h2><P>It just won't post whenever (or usually) I use the word object in a post.</P>
<P>Maybe that is just from my work PC 'cause I'm at home and its working now.&nbsp; I'm at a loss.&nbsp; Anyway, it seems its not an issue with the forums.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
