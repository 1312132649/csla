<P>Let's say I have two DropDownLists, Countries and Provinces, in a FormView. When the user changes the Country, the Province list should change to show the provinces in that country.</P>
<P>I can't figure out how to get the second list to update. If this wasn't in a FormView, then I'd just call DataBind() for the second list. But it doesn't look like you can do that with a control in a FormView. I'm sure there's a way -- I'm just to dense to figure it out.</P>
<P>Any ideas?</P>
