I decided that my unit tests were very basic (mainly because of time constraints - I know that's not an excuse but...). In any case I started planning how to write unit&nbsp;tests for my objects to test things that matter most to me. These&nbsp;I decided to be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Validation rules (simple e.g. string lengths, and custom rules)</LI>
<LI>Authorization (on CanAdd(), CanEdit() etc as well as on AddAuthorizationRules())</LI>
<LI>1 CRUD test</LI></UL>
<P>Now my question is twofold:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The above work fine for BusinessBase objects (or EditableRoot if you like). But how do you go about writing a CRUD test for EditableChild objects? The main issue is FK constraints, the fact that an existing connection (and transaction) need to exist etc... By the way I don't want to use mocks and am happy to hit the database for these operations (even if running time is longer).</LI>
<LI>Writing basic unit tests is boring :-). Has anonye got any templates (CodeSmith or other) for at least the basic of tests (such as for simple validation rules).</LI></OL></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
