Around a year ago&nbsp;i modified the CSLA business objects so that properties are dynamicly created and added. The need for dynamic BusinessRules, Dynamic everything, etc.. so many complex stuff is there. Customers want to implement there own rules and define there own views. But sadly our customers aren&#39;t developers and things will get complex real fast. Implimenting an custom inhouse engine won&#39;t be smart for sure.</p>
<p>Anyway. i&#39;m getting away from my original discussion.</p>
<p>Are more people intrested in dynamic (compiler as a service) business objects&nbsp;/ silverlight content / etc?<br />Or maybe better, is there someone with experience with IronPython or IronRuby?</p>
<p>PS: I think i&#39;ll go for IronPython.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bartol replied on Tuesday, June 29, 2010</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using IronPython with a WPF application with great success. I use it both as an internal scripting engine for automating certain development tasks and as a &quot;compiler as a service&quot; in the Business Layer for dynamic rules and calculations. This is the second project where I do this and the only complications are marshalling very complex types back and forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I chose IronPython instead of IronRuby because it is more mature and because IronRuby wasn&#39;t RTW at the time. It is 1.0 now so choose whichever you like most.</p>

<p>Beside IronPython i saw Mono.CSharp, CSharpCodeProvider, etc.. as DLR languages.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Tuesday, October 19, 2010</h2><p>First: Sorry for bumping an 4 months old topic, but i just want to update on our status.</p>
<p>Bys the looks of it we aren&#39;t going to use IronPython nor IronRuby, but extending Csla objects with DLR code ourself.<br />The biggest reason is that IronPython didn&#39;t feel right to me and some others here.. and we like to stay more on the C# side.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
