<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In my web application, I have to build a User Profile object that has things like Name, Address, a collection of Preferences, Skills, et. I also need to have some security properties like Password, UserName, Secret Question/Answer, LastLogin.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Should these be two separate objects? I noticed in the book that Rocky uses two different databases - one for Security, one for everything else in the ProjectTracker application.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I am currently using the book approach, but would like to hear what others do. Also, because my Identity object has things like Name (as well as UserName) and&nbsp;Email - these are properties of the Profile object, but I've made them also properties of the Security object so I don't have to hit 2 databases just to log a user in. Is this right or am I overthinking it? I've also created a concurrency issue - when someone updates their Name, Email in the Profile page - I also make sure the Name, Email in the Security object is also updated and saved.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Any thoughts on streamlining this would be appreciated... thanx much!</FONT></P>
