<P>I'm mildly "offended" at having to reference a UI library at the business object level, but maybe I just shouldn't worry about it.&nbsp; However, my objects all implement ICustomTypeDescriptor at the moment, which is wreaking havoc at the UI level in general because many of the designer classes can't discover the properties of objects that implement this interface, so I'd like to get rid of it. </P>
<P>Anyone else have thoughts on this? </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
