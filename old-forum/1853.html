<P>Also, what did most of you do?&nbsp; Code the whole book by hand or copy directories into the solution as you needed them by chapter, or setup the whole project at once and just follow along in the book?&nbsp; The last one seems to be the most time efficient to me.</P>
<P>Thanks for any info...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RBrown replied on Monday, November 27, 2006</h2><P>Well, I did figure out that you can just add the MDFs as existing items and that works great to save the manual process.&nbsp; Still would like to know what others are doing as they work through the book...my guess is that most are adding existing items as they go.</P>
