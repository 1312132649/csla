<P>Anyway, I am debugging the Rolodex application successfully thanks to input from Rocky, Sergey and Paul.&nbsp; I was missing the Debug/Attach to process steps and am now able to debug and see what is going on.</P>
<P>The problem is in my prototype application.&nbsp; I am modeling it just like the Rolodex application and in fact, where ever there is the string Rolodex, that is replaced with BAS (for Bel Air System).&nbsp; My Wcf port is 4063 and when I set a break point on line: <BR>GetCslaIdentity&lt;<FONT color=#2b91af><FONT color=#2b91af>BASIdentity</FONT></FONT>&gt;(completed, <FONT color=#0000ff><FONT color=#0000ff>new</FONT></FONT> <FONT color=#2b91af><FONT color=#2b91af>CredentialsCriteria</FONT></FONT><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>(username, password));<BR>on the method:<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2><FONT size=3><FONT color=#808080 size=2><FONT color=#808080 size=2><FONT size=3>public static void GetIdentity(string username, string password, EventHandler&lt;DataPortalResult&lt;BASIdentity&gt;&gt; completed)<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT>and on</FONT><FONT size=3> line:<BR>command.CommandType = System.Data.<FONT color=#2b91af><FONT color=#2b91af>CommandType</FONT></FONT>.StoredProcedure;<BR></FONT><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT color=#000000 size=3>on the method:<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>private</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT size=3> <FONT color=#0000ff><FONT color=#0000ff>void</FONT></FONT> DataPortal_Fetch(<FONT color=#2b91af><FONT color=#2b91af>CredentialsCriteria</FONT></FONT> criteria)<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>the debugger stops on the GetCslaIdentity line but does not stop in the DataPortal_Fetch so I know that code is not getting executed to log in and verify the user and password, but not sure where things are going?&nbsp; It is coming back with an Invalid login though.<BR><BR>Again, any help and advice would be appreciated and all support and help so far has been awesome from you guys.&nbsp; This Silverlight stuff is kicking my butt, but I am having fun digging into it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, where I work, I am the sole developer so I don't have anyone to bounce ideas off of and I just dig in and figure it out one way or the other.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>Happy coding folks.</P>
