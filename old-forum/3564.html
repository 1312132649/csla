<P>City control with a combobox of provinces from which to pick. The required province is not there so we have to go to the province form and add it. Now I want the city control combobox to be automatically updated.</P>
<P>The obvious way is to have the editable province list raise an event that the city control catches, and update the combobox binding source.</P>
<P>But Rocky does not recommend this, even though there is a do not&nbsp;serialize attribute you can add to the event so that the control won't be serialized during saving of the editible list.</P>
<P>The other soluntion I see is to create a new non-csla object containing&nbsp;a province list changed&nbsp;event. Declare the class&nbsp;globally. Manually raise the list changed event in the province control, and catch this event in the city control.</P>
<P>Is this the best way to do it? Is is better just to use the non-bindable attribute?</P>
<P>While this is a simple example and it would be easy just to close and reopen the city control. <BR>But in more complex situations, this does not make the user happy<img src="/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad [:(]" /></P>
