It was suggested to me that I might be able to initiate the save from the root list (BLB) with a DataPortal_Update() and call Child CRUD operations on my root object (BB), hence taking care of any Insert/Updates/Deletes (in a one-shot save).  Can this work and if so, how do I trigger the Child CRUD operations from the DataPortal_Update() of my List object (BLB)?<br /><br />I've seen other post where someone suggested to call NON CSLA CRUD operations from the List object's (BLB) DataPortal_Update() ... is this a correct/good way to handle root list saves?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />SMIMS</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, April 02, 2009</h2>If you're using 3.5 or higher, you should be able to just call base.Child_Update()&nbsp; in your BLB override of dataportal_update.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>smims replied on Thursday, April 02, 2009</h2>Thanks .. that appears to have been the trick.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SMIMS</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
