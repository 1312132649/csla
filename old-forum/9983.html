If you are building a Web Forms UI you might still use this attribute if you find it helpful. </p>
<p>Since Web Forms is now just one of many UI types I&#39;ve stopped putting that attribute into my samples, as it just causes confusion and clutter for most people.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Wednesday, January 26, 2011</h2><p>Thank you!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
