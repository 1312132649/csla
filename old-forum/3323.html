I have some special-case CSLA objects for which n-level undo is not needed, nor desired. It seems that the binding source automatically calls BeginEdit, so I'm looking for the "correct" way to turn this off.<br><br>Can someone either tell me how, or point me to the information that I'm obviously too search-challanged to find? Thanks!!<br><br>Dan<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, August 04, 2007</h2><P>The ability to disable IEditableObject (prevent data binding from invoking n-level undo) is new in CSLA 3.0. Some people have implemented this change themselves, but this is the first time it is directly in the framework.</P>
<P>I'll be fully documenting the change, and its ramifications,&nbsp;in the 3.0 ebook, but the property you are looking for is <FONT size=2>DisableIEditableObject</FONT>, which is a protected property of BusinessBase. Set that to True and call calls to IEditableObject methods are totally ignored.</P>
<P>Be aware that <EM>n-level undo itself</EM> is "disabled" unless someone calls BeginEdit(). That could be data binding through IEditableObject, or directly by you.</P>
<P>So disabling IEditableObject does effectively "disable" n-level undo as long as you don't call BeginEdit() yourself.</P>
<P>And remember that some UI concepts (like in-place editing in a grid) simply won't work right without IEditableObject.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dagware replied on Saturday, August 04, 2007</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div><p>And remember that some UI concepts (like in-place editing in a grid) simply won't work right without IEditableObject.</p></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br>Thanks for the reply. The term "remember" implies that I already knew that, which I didn't, so thanks for the heads-up! I guess I probably don't want to disable it after all.<br><br>Learn something every day...
