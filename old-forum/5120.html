<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I have started working on ASP.NET MVC example, but only week ago.&nbsp;
We are really busy with Csla Light (3.6).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I am thinking actually of building 2 MVC examples:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Using ExtJs as an ajax library<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Using Jquery as an ajax library<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>JQuery will be more like standard MVC Site implementation ,
where ExtJs being a library that allows us to implement more sort of a Windows
like UI using JSON for serializing data back and forth might be more in the
spirit of ProjectTracker and the Csla itself.&nbsp; The problem with the ExtJs
is that it heavily depends on the JSon for everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Check out these examples of ExtJs, and let me know what you
think:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Desktop example:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If you have any comments please let me know.&nbsp; There are
couple of problems I need to solve to have a real MVC example with testability
in mind, like taking the factory out of DataPortal, and that is where Rocky&#8217;s
mobile factory helps &#8211; but we are not there yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I will start blogging about my progress and will be posting
ideas to this newsgroup.&nbsp; Hopefully I will have a sample site for you to
look at and start commenting on within few weeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>To answer your questions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>ASP.NET AJAX was built for web forms to support their &#8220;callback&#8221;
model.&nbsp; Personally I do not consider it a &#8220;True AJAX&#8221; as you
are not getting the full advantages of AJAX (rendering partials, instead of
callback going through a full page lifecycle, sending everything to the client
and then ASP.NET Ajax having to decipher which parts to render).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Besides ASP.NET Ajax is real messy.&nbsp; I find
Jquery/Prototype/ExtJs syntax a lot simpler, easier to learn and lot easier to
extend.&nbsp; They have built an object model that can be easily extended &#8211;
yes OO Javascript, for your UI.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>As far as dynamically changing master pages, controllers View()
method by default accepts View Name as a parameter of which View/Page to
render.&nbsp; But there are overloads that besides View Name accept a Master Page
Name, allowing you to specify which Master Page to use when rendering a view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>As far as an example using DeepData techniques &#8211; I am
planning on having something similar.&nbsp; MVC is going to implement a
Repository Pattern, and use Linq DTOs, similar to what one can see in Rob
Connery&#8217;s MVC storefront example:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sounds great. Just wondering, have you had a chance to start working on this
yet?? I would love to see stuff as it becomes available.<br>
<br>
In terms of the AJAX
stuff, I think using JQuery and ExtJs is a great idea and a good way to go. I
personally havenâ€™t had much experience with either but from what I have seen
thus far, the approach that they bring to the table seems better the asp.net ajax. For a long time I
have felt the same was as you have about asp.net ajax and how 'heavy' it is but
until asp.net mvc utilising these sorts of toolkits hasn't been easy (i.e. due
to things like id's of controls, etc - although these arenâ€™t show stoppers they
make things more difficult). Having said this, I am going to have a fun time
trying to convince clients to go JQuery (or something similar) for new projects
over asp.net ajax - might have to see if I can refine my argument to convince
them ;) <br>
<br>
In terms of the master pages if you have a look at this post you will see what
I am getting on about: http://forums.asp.net/p/1309375/2576549.aspx.<br>
<br>
I know everything with CSLA seems to be going with Linq to SQL, but would it be
possible to have a least 1 example that uses plan ado.net. I know that I could
put this in fairly simply, but I am interested in seeing how you go about faking
out the database components in testing for other things besides Linq.<br>
<br>
Also I was wondering if you where going to use a BDD style of approach to your
tests and I was just wondering what mocking and unit test frameworks you are
planning to use.<br>
<br>
