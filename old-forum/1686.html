<P>Kindly note that this code is already set as i copied it as it is from Tracker source and just changed the Business Object names </P>
<P>In Tracker source, this code block is only given in parent object and i have done the same assuming that child collection and child object will return results automatically but that is not happenning..</P>

I have no experience with this since I never faced the issue (yet).<br><br>Hopefully someone with more relevant experience comes to the rescue. ;-)<br><br>Bayu<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Monday, November 06, 2006</h2><P>i found the solution myself and i'm posting it here so if anybody else is facing this problem then he can try this...</P>

<P>There were 2 binding source, one for child and one for parent.&nbsp;I was only updating the save status on parent binding source -&gt; CurrentItemChanged, now i'm also updating save status&nbsp;in&nbsp;Child binding source-&gt; CurrentItemChanged and problem is solved.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
