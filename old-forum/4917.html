<P>I downloaded version 3.5 and the ProjectTracker sample. Whereas I'm able to compile the framework just fine, I cannot however get ProjectTracker to run. I am only interested in PTWeb with WCF services.</P>
<P>I followed the instructions on how to build ProjectTracker but they're way too outdated.</P>
<P>I am using Vista Ultimate and Visual Studio 2008. Has anyone out there been able to successfully run the PTWeb app with WFC under Vista? Can you help?</P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, May 29, 2008</h2><P>I do most of my work in Vista Ultimate these days (for better or worse).</P>
<P>The instructions are a bit dated, but the requirements remain consistent. Vista doesn't change any of the rules or steps - just the tooling you use to do some steps (most notably steps 3 and 4):</P>
<OL>
<LI>You must have IIS installed. </LI>
<LI>You must have ASP.NET configured to work with IIS. </LI>
<LI>You must create a virtual root for PTWeb. </LI>
<LI>You must ensure that the virtual root allows anonymous users.</LI>
<LI>You must set up VS to start the web site in the IIS host.</LI>
<LI>You can run the WCF data portal in the dev server.</LI>
<LI>But you should check the WCF dev server port, because you may need to change the URL for the data portal in PTWeb's web.config.</LI></OL>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>OK... this sorta, kinda, in a roundabout sort of way applies to this posting...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I've been contemplating moving to Vista at home for a little while now.&nbsp; I haven't done it, for a variety of reasons -&nbsp;one of them being that I have heard several conflicting accounts of getting VS2005 and VS2008 to work within Vista.&nbsp; Several issues have been raised, some UAC-related, some not.&nbsp; For folks who don't have an issue, they either aren't willing to share what they did to get a stable environment, or I get a "I didn't do anything special" response.&nbsp; Other folks who "didn't do anything special" never get&nbsp;things to work right, and end up hating Vista more than their mother-in-law...&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>A search for resources online relating to this doesn't turn up much.&nbsp; Given all the "wildness" of what I've found, I'm hesitant to make the jump.&nbsp; S</FONT><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>o, Rocky, since you work in Vista - what did you have to do to get it to work?&nbsp; Would you recommend it to anyone?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>*sigh*... I find it somewhat disconcerting that a quad-core, 4-GB memory, high-end-GPU machine runs Vista "quite adequately".&nbsp; I realize that developers tend to be "power users", and perhaps he doesn't mean what I think it means - but for that kind of power, I would expect more than a "quite adequately" when describing my OS performance.&nbsp; Add in to that the fact that the stated bottlenecks require even more hardware outlay to get past, and maybe I will wait until Windows 7... if I have to justify an additional hardware cost for a desktop that's a little over a year old, I don't think "switching to Vista" is gonna do it.</FONT></P>

Thanks for all your feedback everyone!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>webjedi replied on Friday, May 30, 2008</h2><P>My experiences are pretty similar to Rocky's.&nbsp; I also echo his sentiment that we should be using it in the same way our users will be using it.&nbsp; The security model in Vista will be around a while...the next Windows coming in 2009 (already...I know)&nbsp;will continue to use it.</P>
<P>I did however decide that I needed to upgrade my machines to be really happy with it...my desktop is now a Core 2 Duo E8500 and I went and bought that expensive DDR3 memory, it runs Vista and VS2008 very nicely.&nbsp; Though it's a shame I had to go that route to get the same performance feel as XP...but such is life.&nbsp; Like Rocky I'm using 32bit I'm just not brave enough to take the 64bit plunge.</P>
<P>On my laptop I was running Vista on an older Dell 1505 Dual Core 1.8ghz...it ran it well enough for me not to be&nbsp;brutally mad&nbsp;at it, but was definately a distant second choice to my desktop.&nbsp; I've since switched to the Dark Side and bought a new Mac Book Pro and have installed Vista Ultimate on it...so far so good...though this was last night.&nbsp; Tonight I'll be installing VS2008 and SQL Server.&nbsp; So I'll be putting it through it's paces at TechEd next week.</P>

<P>You don't have to log on as Administrator...if your right click the short cut icon in your menu you can select Run As Administrator.&nbsp; That way you stay logged on in the context of a 'normal' user (good).</P>
