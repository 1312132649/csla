Before I try to implement the grid from them I wanted to ask a few questions to anyone who has bound a grid from DE to a <FONT color=#000000>CslaDataSource. I am well familiar with doing this using standard ASP.Net controls but not sure how to implement a third party control since they seem to have inline editing which will eliminate my formviews. Pretty much my question is this: Do you hook up the datasource to a DE grid the same way you do with a stock grid?</FONT></P>
<P>Any help would be appreciated,</P>
