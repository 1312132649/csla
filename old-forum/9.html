<P>The answer remains fundamentally the same for version 2.0. Though in version 2.0 the use of reflection is (I think) even more justified because it allows the business developer to write strongly typed DataPortal_XYZ methods. An interface-based approach would force a return to the 1.x approach of passing in parameters of type object and then manually casting them.</P>
<P>All that said, people have altered CSLA .NET to replace the reflection calls with an interface in the past, and I'm sure that change will be done in the future as well. But I don't anticipate making such a change to the core framework itself, because I like the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the UI developer doesn't see the data persistence interface</LI>
<LI>strongly typed parameters for DataPortal_XYZ methods</LI>
<LI>you aren't forced to implement methods you don't usually use or care about (like the pre-, post- and error handling methods in almost all objects, and various other DataPortal_XYZ methods in other types of objects)</LI>
<LI>this is actually a subset of a broader concept called an object portal, and I have a personal affinity for that concept <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></LI></OL>
