Would any of you mind posting sample source to make this work?<br><br>For instance, one problem I am having...<br>I have successfully created a AppointmentList object (BusinessListBase) and Appointment object (BusinessBase).<br>I can load the appointments into the scheduler fine via the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><font color="#0000ff">public static AppointmentList GetAppointmentList(){ return DataPortal.Fetch&lt;AppointmentList&gt;(); }</font><br><br>However when I try to use the UI to add an appointment it is trying to call the constructor of Appointment.
