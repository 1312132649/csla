<P>In the past I put a private _isMoving flag on the collection and added MoveUp/MoveDown methods that removed and re-inserted the items, the flag told the collection to not really delete and re-add a new object. I had an Order column on the table, and passed a value to each child object as it interated through the list.</P>
<P>Is there a way to use a SortedBindingList to allow the users to re-order the list, and then use that order when updating the child objects? Thanks.</P>
