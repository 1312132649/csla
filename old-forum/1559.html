<P>Thanks for your help.</P>

<P>Also along the same lines, what if I want to do something special on the UI to hide/disable certain grid columns based on whether a user can read properties.&nbsp; Is there a way to do this static versus having to load the object?&nbsp; CanInsert, CanUpate, etc. works like this, just not sure if you can do the same from a property standpoint.</P>

<P>You were correct, I just missed it.&nbsp; I was looking in the wrong place.&nbsp; What through me off&nbsp;a little bit was in the Project example provided, it really didn't show it in use for the read only objects.&nbsp; But I have now found that it does exist and would be available.</P>
<P>As for making it static, that is what I was thinking, but not really sure how to do it since ultimately I would have to have instances of the authorization rules and such.&nbsp; So I'm not sure how I would really do that.&nbsp; Just might be something I can't really achieve without actually making an instance and checking.&nbsp; Probably not a huge deal in my app, but would have been nice to try and get working like the other CanXXX() security methods without instances.</P>
<P>Thanks a lot for all your help.&nbsp; It has put me in the right direction.</P>
