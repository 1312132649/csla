<P>Thanks.</P>

<P>I know the comments need some work, but I've been putting off tackling that until there's a workable version of ndoc around. That way I can spend some serious time not only getting rid of the warnings in VS, but also making the results look good in a chm file.</P>
<P>The time commitment is pretty big either way, since I need to do this in a way that the VB and C# comments are all in sync. I actually wrote a utility that monitors the clipboard so I can write comments in VB (because in VS 2005 the XML comment intellisense is better in VB) and then copy-paste the comments into the C# project, with this little utility doing a VB-&gt;C# transform as the data passed through the clipboard.</P>
<P>But even so, it is a lot of time.. And so I'd rather not go through the comments two more times, but rather just one more time and solve both the compiler warnings and ndoc issues in the same pass.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
