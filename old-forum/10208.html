<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Download CSLA 4 version 4.2.0</span></strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The big initiative for version 4.2 is to add support for the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mono</li>
<li>MonoDroid</li>
<li>MonoTouch</li>
</ul>
<p>This alpha release does not include binaries for these platforms, but does include code and sln files (for Visual Studio and/or MonoDevelop) you can use to build the source on each of the platforms.</p>
<p>At this point in time we have the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>CSLA 4 builds and runs on mono in Windows and Linux.<ol>
<li>Core CSLA 4 functionality (Csla.dll) should be the same as on .NET 4.</li>
<li>ASP.NET code using CSLA objects should work using Csla.Web.dll</li>
<li>The Windows Forms support with Csla.Windows.dll is limited due to incompatibilities in data binding between real Windows Forms and the mono implementation of Windows Forms.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>CSLA 4 builds and runs on Android. Use the MonoDroid tools in Visual Studio to build Csla.dll.<ol>
<li>You should find behaviors and features for Android identical to that provided for WP7.</li>
<li>There is not currently an equivalent to Csla.Xaml.dll for Android.</li>
<li>No testing has been done around the use of any remote data portal channel &ndash; only the local data portal has had any testing.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>CSLA 4 builds and runs on iOS (iPhone/iPad). Use MonoDevelop on OS X to build Csla.dll.<ol>
<li>You should find behaviors and features for iOS identical to that provided for WP7.</li>
<li>There is not currently an equivalent to Csla.Xaml.dll for iOS.</li>
<li>No testing has been done around the use of any remote data portal channel &ndash; only the local data portal has had any testing.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Please remember, this is an alpha release, in the early stages of testing and stabilization. Any help you can provide in terms of testing and resolving issues is appreciated!

<p>Other changes of note to existing .NET, SL, or WP7 users include:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an async rule completes, rules for affected properties are now also run</li>
<li>BackgroundWorker from Csla.Threading is now available in WP7</li>
<li>Some cleanup work was done around CslaIdentity &ndash; this shouldn&rsquo;t be a breaking change, but the internals are now quite different</li>
<li>Fix a bug in non-generic GetProperty where field wasn&rsquo;t always set to the correct default value</li>
