<P>I have discovered that the ListChanged event is raised when I <U>add</U> an item to the collection but not when simply edit one - is this the expected behaviour?</P>
<P>I have a feeling the problem may lie in where I am hooking-up the event. Currently, I have the following:</P><FONT size=2>
<P>_customerContactList.ListChanged += </FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>new</FONT><FONT size=2> System.ComponentModel.</FONT><FONT color=#008080 size=2>ListChangedEventHandler</FONT><FONT size=2>(ResetBillToShipTo);</FONT></P>
<P>...in the constructor of the Parent Object (an EO). I think this maybe where the problem lies.</P>

Are you running one of these versions? If so, are you sure the child object is raising IsDirtyChanged (1.x) or PropertyChanged (2.x)?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bonio replied on Thursday, August 03, 2006</h2><P>Hi Rocky</P>
<P>Thanks for the reply.</P>
<P>I think the problem was due to when I was 'hooking-up' the event. I initially had it in the EO's constructor and this worked fine when the object was new but not when it was just changed. I have since moved the event 'hook-up' code to the Public property for the childlist and this is now working fine.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
