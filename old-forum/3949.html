I have ten rows in the table but the SDR only returns one. Any suggestions? BTW this started occurring when I setup the wcfportal and started porting to wpf client.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Wednesday, November 28, 2007</h2><P>Not sure if this is your case, and I haven't used wcf, but the times I've seen that happen is when I've screwed up and had a dr.NextResult() where there shouldn't be one.</P>
