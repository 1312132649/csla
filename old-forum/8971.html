When the property is valid, I want the PropertyStatus to have its Visibility set to Collapsed. I figured I could do this via Binding, however, the IsValid property isn&#39;t a Dependency Property, so I don&#39;t think that will do the trick.</p>
<p>Am I missing something here? Should I just roll my own version?</p>

I thought it would have to be a dependency property in order for it to work - otherwise how does WPF know when the value changes?</p>
<p>I know normal CSLA properties aren&#39;t dependency properties, but I thought the reason they work is the IBindable (or whatever it is)&nbsp;backing you provide. Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Obviously I can just try it and see, and I will, but I&#39;m trying to learn at the same time. Any light you can shed would be greatly appreciated, as are, of course, all the great things you provide!</p>

<p>But in your case you want simple property binding, and since PropertyStatus implements INotifyPropertyChanged it will work just fine.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dagware replied on Saturday, May 22, 2010</h2><p>Ah, &quot;INotifyPropertyChanged&quot;. That&#39;s what I wasn&#39;t taking into account.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to explain it! And yes, it does indeed work.</p>
