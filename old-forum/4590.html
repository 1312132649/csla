In the Project Tracker, if I edit the Name field and then edit the Description field, then click Cancel to undo one step, I would have expected only the Description edit to be rolled back. Instead, all changes since the last save are undone. No matter how many fields are changed, the EditLevel never goes past 2. How do you get the binding source to call BeginEdit() each time PropertyHasChanged() fires?<br></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, March 31, 2008</h2>This is the way n-level undo is designed to work.
