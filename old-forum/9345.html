<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">I get that CSLA is not and ORM, and what&nbsp;I am looking to create is a sort of specialized ORM.&nbsp; One of the things that sets this apart from a standard ORM is that I need to select data from&nbsp;two&nbsp;different models&nbsp;but only write to one. I am trying to create an app that will consume and document the data from another app.&nbsp; Users should be able to query the various collections of data, see the relationships, compare them to one another and then save information they have gathered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">So...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">I don&#39;t want advice on creating an orm.&nbsp; I want design advice on whether this sounds like a proper candidate for CSLA objects.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">I need a root object that contains multiple collections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">The items in each collection may themselves have/be collections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">Items in one collection may relate to items in another collection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">I don&rsquo;t want to populate the entire hierarchy of objects at application startup.&nbsp; I would prefer to lazy load items in the hierarchy as needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">I want to save entire collections or individual items in a collection as needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">I want to be able to compare collections to one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">&nbsp;Would these needs&nbsp;be well served by using CSLA objects to define the hierarchy of collections? Should I consider a POCO implementation instead?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">If you do think this is a good fit for CSLA objects, how would you go about designing an object with a list of other objects that might in turn contain lists and for which you might sometimes wish to save in batches and other times just save information about single nodes?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:black;font-size:9pt;">I apologize in advance for the rather abstract nature of this question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am struggling rather mightily with this design decision.&nbsp; I appreciate any comments folks migh wish to share.</span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 09, 2010</h2><p>From your description it sounds like the data is read-only - for analysis?</p>
<p>If so, then you can probably use the read-only object and list stereotypes.</p>
<p>This multiple-reference-to-objects scenario only gets complex if the objects are editable, because the various data binding and edit level implementations start to conflict - BB and BLB make certain assumptions about objects having exactly one parent.</p>
<p>But read-only objects aren&#39;t undoable and don&#39;t support all the edit-related data binding constructs, so they aren&#39;t subject to the same limitations in this regard.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>djcohen66 replied on Tuesday, August 10, 2010</h2><p>The source data is read only, but then I want to be able to persist some fields from the source into a second database with a schema of relative&nbsp;tables created for&nbsp;my&nbsp;app, and then I want the ability to keep aspects of the the two in sync based on the results of analysis.</p>
<p>All the objects do have one&nbsp;real parent each, but they can&nbsp;also be represented in&nbsp;relation to other objects in ways that make them look like a child. Similar to the database concept of a referential integrity constraint. Tables have columns, but a constraint can also &quot;have&quot; some of the same&nbsp;columns or a view&nbsp;can make use of those columns. These other objects&nbsp;also have a parent relationship to those columns, owning them as children.&nbsp; Truely the columns&nbsp;really belong to the table, taking up data page space within the extent reserved for that table, but other objects still can be represented as the parent of column.</p>
<p>These are similar to my situation.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try to move forward with CSLA objects since I have moved a fair way down that road already.&nbsp; But i&#39;ll have to think hard about which stereotypes to use and where.&nbsp; Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; It wasnt really a fair question in the first place since you have no clue what i am really trying to build.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
