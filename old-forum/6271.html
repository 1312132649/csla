<P>When I try to run a newly installed CLSA 3.6 Project Tracker, I get a message that says:</P>
<P>The HTTP request is unauthorized with client authentication scheme 'Anonymous'. The authentication header received from the server was 'NTLM'.</P>
<P>I am kind of new to all this stuff, and could use a little help.&nbsp; I enabled Anonymous Authentication but that didn't help, so I disabled it and enabled Forms Authentication, but that didn't do the trick either.&nbsp; The help file said to add this to the web config:</P>
<P>&lt;bindings&gt;<BR>&nbsp; &lt;customBinding&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;binding name="Service1Binding"&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;transactionFlow /&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;textMessageEncoding /&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;httpTransport authenticationScheme="Ntlm" /&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/binding&gt;<BR>&nbsp; &lt;/customBinding&gt;<BR>&lt;/bindings&gt;</P>
<P>and this to (I believe) the calling program:</P>
<P>&lt;endpoint address="" binding="customBinding" bindingConfiguration="Service1Binding" contract="IService1" /&gt;</P>
<P>It still didn't work...so I removed them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am developing through an RDP session to Windows Server 2008 with IIS 7.&nbsp; </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 28, 2009</h2>While I think you can do this through web.config, I always use the Administrator Tools option for managing IIS. In that tool you can set the authentication mode for the virtual root to enable anonymous users, and it sounds like it is at that level that you are having the problem.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
