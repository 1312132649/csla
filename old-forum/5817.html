<P>I figured out how to short circuit the common "StringRequired" rule by changing it from this.....<BR><BR>ValidationRules.AddRule(AddressOf Csla.Validation.CommonRules.StringRequired, New Csla.Validation.RuleArgs("DateOrderTaken", "Date order taken"), 0)</P>
<P>.....to this....<BR><BR>ValidationRules.AddRule(AddressOf Csla.Validation.CommonRules.StringRequired, New Csla.Validation.RuleArgs("DateOrderTaken", "Date order taken", <FONT color=#ff0000>Csla.Validation.RuleSeverity.Error</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>True</FONT>), 0)</P>
<P>But I cannot figure out how to short circuit the common "MinValue" rule for this rule.....</P>
<P>ValidationRules.AddRule(AddressOf Csla.Validation.CommonRules.MinValue(Of Integer), New Csla.Validation.CommonRules.MinValueRuleArgs(Of Integer)("OrderTypeId", "Order type number", -1), 0)</P>
<P>I expected the "MinValue" rule would be&nbsp;short circuited similar to the "StringRequired" rule.&nbsp; But from what I'm seeing with the intellisense that does not appear to be the case.&nbsp; I know I could write my own custom rule method and get it done that way, but that seems silly.&nbsp; I have to be missing something here -- probably something obvious and simple.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xxxJasonxxx replied on Wednesday, November 19, 2008</h2><EM>bump</EM> <img src="/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue [:P]" /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 19, 2008</h2><P>What are you trying to accomplish?</P>
<P>Short-circuiting works in two ways: automatic and manual.</P>
<P>Automatic works by priority. By default all priority 0 rules run, and if any fail then priority 1+ don't run. Similarly, if 0 and 1 pass, then 2 runs, but if any 2 fails then 3+ don't run. Etc.</P>
<P>Manual works by having the rule method itself indicate that no further rules should run. This is only really useful when used with priorities though, as rules <EM>within&nbsp;a priority</EM> will run in an indeterminate order.</P>
<P>But to get automatic short-circuiting, you don't need to do anything special beyond putting expensive rules at priority 1+ so they only run if all the cheap priority 0 rules pass.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xxxJasonxxx replied on Wednesday, November 19, 2008</h2><P>Your descriptions made me realize that I misunderstood how short circuiting works.</P>
<P>Setting the priority number (automatic) will accomplish my goal.</P>
