<P>Thanks</P>

<P>A RB tree is just a balanced binary tree, using the property value as an indexer. So if your property values are just T/F or 0/1 then you'll have a horribly distorted tree and you might as well avoid the indexing overhead and just allow any query to do a linear scan of the collection (because that's about all you'd get anyway).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
