<P>The only thing to remember, is that Shared/static values live at the AppDomain level - so on a server they are shared across users and threads in most cases. Also, if the AppDomain is recycled (by ASP.NET for instance) then your cache is gone.</P>
<P>But those are not usually negatives - and this is a perfectly good approach for in-memory caching.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dnebula replied on Monday, July 10, 2006</h2>I do pretty much the same thing, exept that I store mapping info in the hashtable since I can't cache the SQL directly. The point is; it works perfectly :)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ScottBessler replied on Monday, July 10, 2006</h2>Good to hear, thanks for the quick responses guys.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
