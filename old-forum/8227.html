I can't believe how complicated is to open PayPal account. Is there option for wire transfer or anything else?<br /><br />Sorry for bothering on forum... I don't find any other place to ask this question.<br /><br />br </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, December 29, 2009</h2><P>The only payment mechanism I have is through PayPal. But PayPal accepts major credit cards, so there's no real reason to set up a PayPal account. Most people just use a Visa, MasterCard or whatever and don't have PayPal accounts.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Pixel replied on Wednesday, January 06, 2010</h2>Silly question really Rocky....but is the store built using CSLA?<br /><br />Is CSLA a good choice for building e-commerce apps?  I assume it is but if you told me it's better to look elsewhere I'd probably save quite a bit of time.  :-)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 06, 2010</h2><P>No, the store software is a low-cost add-in to DNN. I have no idea what was used to create it.</P>
<P>You could absolutely write an e-commerce app using CSLA .NET. The origin of the framework was complex point of sale&nbsp;project I was working on in the mid-90's, which included customer, product and inventory tracking as well as standard purchase transaction functionality.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Pixel replied on Thursday, January 07, 2010</h2>Thanks Rocky.   I thought as much. <br /><br />I'm going to have a look at in much greater detail this week.  <br /><br />A key requirement for me is a pipeline approach like MS Commerce Server.  I might open a new thread on this topic to see if anyone is interested in collaborating.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Pixel </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
