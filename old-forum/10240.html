<p>The Csla.Wpf namespace in CSLA 3.8 contains the&nbsp;IdentityConverter class.</p>
<p>In CSLA 4.1, the Csla.Xaml namespace for Silverlight does not appear to contain the&nbsp;IdentityConverter class and this is the only forum post I can find mentioning&nbsp;IdentityConverter and Silverlight, but the issue appears to remain unsolved:</p>

<p>I&#39;m porting a WPF CSLA 3.8 project to Silverlight CSLA 4.1 and I&#39;m having issues with databinding and I&#39;m not sure if the lack of&nbsp;IdentityConverter could be causing the issue. &nbsp;Thoughts?</p>

I don&#39;t recall the specific binding option off the top of my head, but there&#39;s a way to tell the binding to always refresh.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, Silverlight never had this same issue, I think it was only a WPF binding problem.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MichaelMaddox replied on Thursday, April 07, 2011</h2><p><span>IdentityConverter&nbsp;still exists in CSLA 4.1 in the Csla.Xaml component for WPF.</span></p>
<p>I have now confirmed that the problems I was having were not related to&nbsp;IdentityConverter, so my problem is solved although I&#39;m still interested to learn the specific binding option introduced in place of the need for&nbsp;IdentityConverter.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
