<p><br />We have a new developer/customer who is developing with Axis2 and trying to consume the web service (I think he is trying Maven to create the proxy) and no matter what we try the SOAP headers are not showing up in the proxy.</p>
<p>I have googled around and it appears that .NET generates the wsdl with implicit soap headers (information not in the portType) and not the explicit headers that java needs. &nbsp;I&#39;m having the worst time trying to find a work around to fix my wsdl generated by .NET.</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this? &nbsp;Found a fix?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
