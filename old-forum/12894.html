<p>These days I just assume everything of value is in NuGet, and my primary focus with CSLA releases has been NuGet for the past couple years.</p>
<p>I do still maintain the msi installer, but it is kind of a PITA, especially if nobody uses it.</p>
<p>My train of thought is that anyone who wants the samples, source code, and other artifacts can just as easily pull the zip archive that GitHub automatically creates for each CSLA release.</p>
<p>What do you all think? Keep or drop the msi installer project?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, June 05, 2015</h2><p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drop it. It&#39;s just as easy to download using GIT or as a zip file from Github.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bboney replied on Friday, June 05, 2015</h2><p>Nope. &nbsp;Drop it. &nbsp;So many more important CSLA things on which to spend time...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, June 05, 2015</h2><p>Ya, I think its safe to do away with the MSI.&nbsp; You could always package samples as NuGet packages too.&nbsp; For source code, it seems like the way to go is push things to SymbolSource.org to push both the PDBs and source code.&nbsp; So those might be worthwhile to look into.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 05, 2015</h2><p>We have been pushing the source to symbolsource for some years now.</p>
<p>Creating a NuGet package for the samples is an interesting idea.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, June 05, 2015</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b>We have been pushing the source to symbolsource for some years now.

<p>Oh, haha, I had no idea.&nbsp; That&#39;s great to know.</p>
</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, June 08, 2015</h2><p>I&#39;ve now added a work item in GitHub for this possible change</p>
<p>https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/issues/376</p>
<p>Comment here or on the issue in GitHub if you have anything to add to the dialog, otherwise I&#39;ll probably end up removing the msi installer.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
