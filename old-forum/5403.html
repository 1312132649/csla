<P>Is it better to have a read-only list of editable items and "disable" the save for items that aren't the most current, or is it better to have a read-only list of read only items that pass the ID of the one to void to a command object that voids the record?</P>
<P>Ex:</P>
<P>ID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Void</P>
<P>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Void&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9/1/08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Void(Link)</P>
<P>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8/25/08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voided</P>
<P>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oldest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7/12/08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voided</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, September 15, 2008</h2><P>While a Read Only list can contain items which can be edited. I prefer to think of the list itself and the objects in it as Read Only. </P>
<P>So I vote for #2 - keep the ROC as purely read only and pass the value of the one to be invalidated to a command object. </P>

Perhaps from a purist, OO, "behaviour not data" etc point of view, then by definition the list (or at least one object) <span>is</span> editable because you can change its state from not-void to void. In that case, I guess the other objects would in effect have a business rule that prevents them from being saved, while the top-most object does not.<br><br>However, from a pragmatic view it may be easier and more maintainable to go with the ROC / command object approach and I do have a tendancy to go with pragmatism if it results in simplfying things...<br><br>Dan.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
