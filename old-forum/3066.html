<P>I'm very familar with updating 1 object at a time but I know nothing about updating a whole slew of them at once.&nbsp; I don't even know if it is possible to databind in this situation.</P>
<P>Recommendations?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, June 21, 2007</h2><P>You have to bind a grid/repeater to a single object.</P>
<P>Build one for this use case and then once it has all the values, either use it to populate other BOs or the database.</P>
