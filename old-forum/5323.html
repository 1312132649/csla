<P>Why not look at the MS EntLib for you DAL needs?&nbsp; Personally I would still isolate my DAL calls to an intermediate class so I would not be dependant on any specific technology, and then back that with the EntLib DAL, straight ADO.net, ODP.net etc.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, August 31, 2008</h2>Look at Subsonic - works fine with .Net 2.0, open-source and multiple databases. <br><br>You should also be using CSLA 3.0.4 which works fine on .Net 2.0 (even without SP1). <br><br>/jonnyb<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
