<p>Here are my questions:</p>
<p>1: What is the current CSLA release and is it based in .NET 4.0?</p>
<p>2: Is VS2010 the IDE of choice?</p>
<p>3: Is the MVVM pattern for desktop applications well defined and supported by latest release of CSLA?</p>
<p>4: Is there a CSLA (latest version) book forthcoming?</p>
<p>5: I see MVVM videos are available?&nbsp; Recommendations?</p>
<p>I know some of these questions are probably very obvious but my fear is that I&#39;ll invest a great deal of time in effort learning a pattern that will be abandoned about the time I master it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;d like to use VS2010 with CSLA and a proper MVVM pattern for all future development but I want to put my finger to the wind and make sure I&#39;m investing my time in something that will be the standard for at least the next 24 months.&nbsp; I also want something that is mature enough to not undergo radical changes - something concrete and settled.</p>
<p>Please offer your advice along with recommended books, videos, articles and rationale for your thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Wednesday, September 29, 2010</h2><p>1. I think 4.0.1 has been released - if it hasn&#39;t, it will very soon.&nbsp; It is based on .NET 4.0.</p>
<p>2. If you want to do any .NET 4.0 programming, you don&#39;t have any other&nbsp;choice.&nbsp; Given that the latest CSLA version is compiled against 4.0... <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>
<p>3. Is MVVM supported by CSLA?&nbsp; Very much so.&nbsp; Is it a &quot;well defined&quot; pattern?&nbsp; That&#39;s a thornier question.&nbsp; Rocky has called it the POTY (Pattern Of The Year), though I think it may have a little bit more longevity than that (and I&#39;m betting he thinks that too.)&nbsp; It turns out to work pretty well with XAML-based apps (with a little infrastructure-code help), and since I think that&#39;s the direction MS is taking with their UI design, I&#39;m betting it sticks around for a while.&nbsp; You should realize that the &quot;flavor&quot; of MVVM Rocky supports through both CSLA and Bxf is a little different than what you may see if you go web-crawling.&nbsp; Most MVVM patterns in the Microsoft space assume your model is dumb entity objects.&nbsp; CSLA BO&#39;s are obviously not &quot;dumb&quot; objects, so Rocky approaches it a little differently (see #5).</p>
<p>4. To the best of my knowledge, Rocky is no longer&nbsp;producing paper books - the tech is changing too fast.&nbsp; I know he&#39;s planning on some more videos, and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s intending to do some more e-books.&nbsp; He has a roadmap page on the site that shows a basic timeline, but nothing&#39;s set in stone yet (that I know of).</p>
<p>5. I found the MVVM videos to be <i>extremely</i> useful.&nbsp; They show Rocky&#39;s take on how to implement MVVM using CSLA (which, as I mentioned, is different than a lot of other material I&#39;ve seen), and they show how to do it in VS 2010.&nbsp; You have to already understand how to construct CSLA business objects, but if you&#39;ve kept even remotely current with&nbsp;how BO&#39;s are&nbsp;structured, you should be fine.&nbsp; There&nbsp;is also&nbsp;a <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">MIX</span> Tech Ed session that Rocky did talking about doing MVVM in VS 2010 (http://www.msteched.com/2010/NorthAmerica/DEV322) that shows his thoughts, and even though it&nbsp;isn&#39;t CSLA-focused,&nbsp;I found that to be a pretty good adjunct to the MVVM videos.</p>

<p>Follow up question: Would the videos on CLSA 3.8 teach me what I need to know about CSLA 4.0.1 or are there CSLA 4.0.1 available or coming soon?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Wednesday, September 29, 2010</h2><p>The 3.8 videos are &quot;the current standard&quot;, and will get you a long ways there.&nbsp; The basic object structure is relatively unchanged, but there are some significant changes between 3.8 and 4, such as the business-rules system.&nbsp; To that end, Rocky has linked to a previous forum topic from his FAQ page:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/9225.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/9225.aspx</a></p>
<p>That will at least get you started.&nbsp; For specifics on the changes in 4, check his blog postings - most of the really big changes in CSLA 4 have been detailed there.</p>
<p>There are also some changes in version 4 that came about because of the changes in SL 4, and some other design decisions that were made about breaking out inheritance trees for XAML-based binding versus Winforms-based binding.&nbsp; Again, a search of the forums/blog posts will fill you in on that information.</p>
<p>As far as&nbsp;future videos go, Rocky&nbsp;has plans to do version-4-specific videos.&nbsp; As I mentioned previously, he does have a &quot;roadmap&quot; page showing his current thoughts.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the timelines on that page aren&#39;t set in stone, and I can&#39;t seem to find it right now (but I know it&#39;s there - Rocky has linked to it in a few forum posts.)&nbsp; To my mind, the 3.8 videos are still worth the investment, as we&#39;re not sure what exactly will be in the version-4 videos yet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what this all ends up meaning is that there really isn&#39;t one place you can go to right now to get up to speed on CSLA 4.&nbsp; If you aren&#39;t familiar with the new property syntax and the other 3.6-era changes, you&#39;ll want to get the videos - they are going to be the single best source.&nbsp; And probably 85-90% of that will still apply.&nbsp; But for the rest, you&#39;ll have to do some searching and merging on your own to get up to 4.0.</p>
<p>HTH</p>
