So far is looking ok but there is one thing that just bugs me immensely. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The thing that bothers me is that there does not appear to be a native control that we can use to show reports on WPF, it looks like you need to host your report on an old winform or use some other hacky way.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The fact that Microsoft didn&rsquo;t even considered creating a native wpf report viewer gives me a very bad feeling about all these. I am wondering if they stopped supporting their reporting tool a long time ago and left it in a mediocre state and full of bugs and I that am going to regret going on that direction.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Anyone can offer me some feedback on this topic?</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Thanks.</span></span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, November 01, 2011</h2><p>Hi</p>
<p>IIRC, the report viewer control is owned by the SqlServer teram as the client for Reporting Services and is only available for Windows Forms and ASP.NET. </p>
<p>Quite from Riccardo Muti: <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqldenreportingservices/thread/3fd168bb-368b-4fa0-b49a-eea3c5e64a28">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqldenreportingservices/thread/3fd168bb-368b-4fa0-b49a-eea3c5e64a28</a></p>
<p><i>Denali doesn&#39;t include a Silverlight ReportViewer control for 
traditional SSRS reports. (Crescent is built on Silverlight, but it 
targets Crescent reports only and it&#39;s not an embeddable Silverlight 
control in this release.) However, you can use Silverlight-HTML
 interop to integrate a Silverlight application with the ReportViewer 
Web Forms control. You may find this blog post helpful:

http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2010/05/10/integrating-html-into-silverlight-applications.aspx</a>. Similarly, you can integrate a WPF application with the ReportViewer Windows Forms control using WPF-WinForms interop.</i></p>
<p>I&#39;ve only uses ReportViewer in local mode for objects in Widows Forms. I&#39;ve wanted to look at XtraReports (<a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Reporting/">http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Reporting/</a>) as this provides native controls for WinForms,. ASP.NET,&nbsp; MVC, WPF, Silverlight and LightSwitch but haven&#39;t had the time yet. <i><br /></i></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>geordiepaul replied on Tuesday, November 01, 2011</h2><p>I would strongly recommend looking at the Telerik report viewer. Depending on your requirement it may work for you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not used it with WPF but it&#39;s certainly been less problematic than SSRS</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>StefanCop replied on Tuesday, November 01, 2011</h2><p>We are using the devexpress XtraReport (because it fits our reproting needs best and easiest) and WPF. </p>
<p>And yes, DevExpress nowadays has a true WPF preview control, which is really useful (although it has not yet every advanced feature that the winforms had).</p>
<p>Our requirements are printing with &quot;one button click&quot; a report on a specific client-side printer, and on pages from different trays). That&#39;s why we use&nbsp; the the &quot;old&quot; Printing System. That&#39;s one reason we choose WPF over SL two years ago. I suppose this part is less WPF but more old Winforms style.</p>
