<p>I&#39;m new to the forums and new to CSLA as well. Got a quick overview and read some documents and found the CE version of the framework. </p>
<p>Now I got a question. I understand that using CSLA a business object could be transmitted over a network from a Windows CE device. For example to a server running on a PC. </p>
<p>Now my question is this: Which version of the CSLA framework would I use to write that server that would be able to &quot;understand&quot; business objects created on the CE device ?</p>
<p>Or would it be the best to use the CE version itself and compile it as a normal windows application for use in the server ?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, December 13, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;m not entirely sure how Lawrence implemented the CE version, but I suspect there&#39;s no data portal - at least not for communicating with the server. To do that he&#39;d have had to create a serializer like we did for the Silverlight version a couple years later, and that&#39;s not easy to do.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m pretty sure that the scenario for the CE version is to run CSLA on the client and make service calls (asmx or whatever) to the server - no objects would flow between the client and server, just XML messages.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t looked into this, but it might be reasonably easy to port CSLA 4 to the Compact Framework. All the work we did to support Silverlight directly translated to Windows Phone 7 of course, so it took me perhaps 40 hours or less to get the WP7 version working. I don&#39;t know how CF compares to Silverlight in terms of .NET functionality, but if it is reasonably close it would probably take around 40 hours to get a CE/CF version running.</p>
<p>That&#39;s something you might consider if full data portal functionality is critical to your application.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
