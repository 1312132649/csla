<P>Basically I have a class derived from NameValueListBase which contains an integer key and a string value.</P>
<P>What I really want is to override&nbsp;the string representation of the items within this list, which are obviously of type NameValuePair&lt;int,string&gt;.&nbsp; As NameValuePair is a nested class, I can't see how I can override the ToString function of this class to achieve this.&nbsp; Is this indeed impossible or am I missing something?&nbsp; Is there any other way to achieve this.</P>
<P>If the above isn't possible then what I need is an object which can hold an integer and string key/value pair but which returns only the string from the ToString override.&nbsp; Is there such a class in C#/.NET already or will I have to create one?&nbsp; The most obvious solution would be to derive a class from the KeyValuePair generic struct but it's sealed :(</P>
<P>Any advice appreciated.</P>
