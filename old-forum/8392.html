<p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="CodeInline"><span><font color="#008000" face="Courier New">Parent</font></span></span> property is now <span class="CodeInline"><span><font color="#008000" face="Courier New">public</font></span></span> scope.<br><br></p></span>Applying this change to our code (version 3.8.1 as havent got vs 2010 atm), this now breaks our code as we use the DataMapper to copy values from 1 object to another.<br><br>I know that i can add "Parent" to the ignoreList but i was just wondering if this property should be ignored automatically by the DataMapper as if you are copying objects, surely you dont want to copy the "Parent" property, because for 1 its readonly in the source object and if the target object is of the same type then it would be readonly there anyway.<br><br>Am i right in thinking this should be ignored in the DataMapper automatically?&nbsp; Can this change be added?&nbsp; if something has been added, then can someone let me know as i havent got vs 2010 at the moment so cant really see without searching through each cs file separatly.<br><br>Cheers<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, January 21, 2010</h2><P>That is certainly an unintended side-effect. I've noticed that the property appears in the Data Sources window too, which is another unintended side-effect I need to look into.</P>
