<p>I&#39;m in the middle of deployment SL 5 App use CSLA 4.3.12</p>
<p>I have a view when I run from VS ( F5 ) I Got an expected behavior BUT</p>
<p>When I call my app from IIS on Win Server 2008, My Check Box on that View is not run correctly, BUT I still can save Business Object bound to that view into the Database </p>
<p>&nbsp;I Really don&#39;t have idea what happened here ?? It&#39;s look like that there is something not run when I&#39;m not run it from VS ( F5 ), BUT What is that ??</p>
<p>is there any sugesstions or anything could help me ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks&nbsp; a lot</p>
