<P>I'll frame this in terms of the ProjectTracker sample, for consistancy.&nbsp; There are different categories of projects, not all of which are publicly viewable.&nbsp; In a given listing, some roles should be able to see all, while several others each only see a subset.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to apply this to the ProjectList class?</P>
<P>All the examples I'm seeing look like they'd throw an error if someone pulled up a listing that included records that they weren't authorized to view.&nbsp; I just want them hidden.&nbsp; Any ideas?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, March 01, 2007</h2><P>You add q new Shared method anda new CriteriaRole class to the BO so you can pass the criteria thru the DataPortal and then act on it. </P>
<P>So you could have a RoleID as your critieria and pass that string to a new class named CriteriaRole which passes it to the DP. </P>
<P>There you determine which type of criteria was passed (Criteria or CriteriaRole) and branch accordingly. </P>
<P>Eventually you pass the RoleID to a SP or a SQL statement and you only retrieve those projects for that RoleID.</P>
