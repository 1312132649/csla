I'm trying the ProjectTracker, and I'm not understand the use of

<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I didn&#8217;t create the SL ProjectTracker because it would
have interfered with the <i>Expert 2008 Business Objects</i> book effort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>However, there are a lot of CSLA .NET for Silverlight examples
in the Samples download, and a whole set of very focused samples available as
part of the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/">CSLA .NET for Silverlight video
series</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Arguably at this point there are better samples for Silverlight
than for Windows. Certainly there are more narrowly focused samples to show
specific features and capabilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>And there are also two broader SL samples: Rolodex and
InventoryDemo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
