<P>The client that I am working for is upgrading a desktop app that we wrote (CSLA - of course)... and wants to port it to the web so that clients can assist in some of the functionality. The firm requires Single Sign On (SSO) for all web applications for their internal users - but we won't be able to authenticate outside users against their AD. So - I need to be able to used a "mixed" authentication scheme wherein internal users are authenticated against AD (though their roles / allowed views) will be derived from a SQL database and external users must login.</P>
<P>Can someone get me started on implementing Windows Authentication for some users, and Forms Authentication for all those that fail&nbsp;the Windows route? </P>
<P>Your help is greatly appreciated!</P>
<P>Regards,</P>
