<p>Why InputProperties is not initialized with PrimaryProperty in BusinessRule constructor. If there is specific reason for this, then it probably should be initialized with PrimaryProperty in CommonRules.Lambda.</p>
<p>And, on side note. Am I right that if I want to do some actions when the value of the property modified (like initialize some variables not covered by FieldManager) Lambda Rule is the easiest way to go?<span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"></span></span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 08, 2010</h2><p>The Lambda rule is really an experiment for implementing the most trivial of custom rules - I&#39;m not entirely sure it is terribly useful to be honest.</p>
<p>For anything beyond the most trivial of rules, I create actual rule types.</p>
<p>The thing about Lambda is that it doesn&#39;t achieve any testability, so it doesn&#39;t really seem all that great to me for anything beyond super-trivial one-liner rules.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
