<P>I'm jealous of you what with being on holiday and all.&nbsp; In&nbsp;the first&nbsp;five weeks of my current job, I've worked 56 hours, 74 hours, 66 hours, 70 hours and 78 hours, respectively.&nbsp; I finally got&nbsp;this&nbsp;past&nbsp;weekend off.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Wednesday, July 04, 2007</h2>It should be fine to use the SortedBindingList as it implements IList, which is all list controls really care about anyway.<br><br>I am only half on holiday.&nbsp; I am working remotely from halfway around the world while spending my paternity leave so my new daughter can meet her grandparents in southern California.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
