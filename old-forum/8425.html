<P>In smart client technologies (everything but ASP.NET) the CSLA validation model causes most rules to run on the client. You have to do something specifically different if you want a rule to run on the app server.</P>
<P>In the web things are different. This is because the web technologies are really quite poor for business app development. In the web, your .NET code can't run in the browser - pretty much by definition...</P>
<P>The easiest and cheapest solution is to use Silverlight, because that lets you create a "web app" that is really a smart client.</P>
<P>But if you can't do that, the next best thing is probably to use ASP.NET MVC 2 (which isn't out yet unfortunately), because MVC 2 will automatically project client-side script code into the web page based on validation attributes on your object properties.</P>
<P>And if you can't do that, then you might look at ASP.NET MVC 1, along with one of the open source projects out there that projects client-side script into the web page based on attributes on your object properties.</P>
<P>And if you can't do that, then you'll need to create some ASP.NET Web Forms code&nbsp;to project validation controls into the web form based on the rules defined in your object.</P>
<P>To make this possible, CSLA .NET allows you to ask an object for its list of rules. You'll get back a list of rule:// URI values, and there's a RuleDescription type that helps you parse those URI values into useful information (like System.Uri, but more specialized).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bharat0204 replied on Friday, January 29, 2010</h2>Thanks you very much for your instant reply.<br /><br />sorry but as suggested by you i cant implement any of that new way as the project is almost completed and going live by next month.<br />the only remaining is some validation on which i am working and come across above senerio mentioned.<br /><br />also i m new to CSLA as well so not much familiar about the concept. i watched your video and gone through the book and come across some fundamentals of CSLA.<br /><br />so now just i saw the implemented validation rule in my current project which struck me so i asked about the best way to achieve this.<br /><br />so if you please suggest me some way to achieve without lots of changes and less time then it is great to me.<br /><br />looking for your suggestion.<br /><br />thanks in advance.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, January 29, 2010</h2><P>Are you building a Web Forms user interface?</P>
<P>If yes, then you only have two options:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Manually add validator controls to your UI - duplicating the validation logic from your business objects</LI>
<LI>Write code to automatically insert validator controls in your UI based on the rule:// URI information from the business object</LI></OL>
