The BOs are already being used in a winforms application. The data portal methods connect to an SQL database different than the one that contains DNN. They have their business logic, and I don't want to recreate everything using the DNN approach (its DAL, its controllers etc). However I'll need to integrate the authentication logic (IsInRole...) with DNN's security mechanism. And finally some way to bind the objects into controls that will show up inside a DNN module.<br><br>Has anyone done such a thing and could give me some pointers?<br><br>Thank you!<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
