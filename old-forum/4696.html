We started by looking into book and CodeSmith templates we found, so every property now has <FONT face="Courier New">CanReadProperty(&lt;property name&gt;, true)</FONT> and<FONT face="Courier New"> CanWriteProperty(&lt;promoerty name&gt;, true)</FONT> calls.</P>
<P>However, we do not really use them, and even if we will, there will be just few of them. So, I am thinking about removing all of them first for perfomance, second - well I don't like having code that is not used.</P>
<P>The question is more academic, or subjective&nbsp;one. Do you&nbsp;try to follow "The Book" and leave <FONT face="Courier New">CanReadProperty</FONT> or do you remove them when not needed.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, April 16, 2008</h2><P>I have removed them when not needed.</P>
<P>My Codesmith templates can optionally include them by changing a setting to True.</P>

This is so that we don't accidentally assume that this particular object has some form of authentication logic applied and like you said, I just don't like having code around that has no true meaning. <br><br>Marjon<br></font></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>d3vil replied on Thursday, April 17, 2008</h2>there is a very big downside to this...<br>in the case of a property will get some more logic or will need securtiy, its more likely that the programmer editing the "naked" property will forget adding it.<br><br>when no secuirty rules are defined I think the canRead/Write aren't that much a problem issue.. and won't really hart you if you keep them..<br>I will suggest that if you want to remove them ,try to consider to remark them instead...<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>maxal replied on Thursday, April 17, 2008</h2>Actually I made my mind and removing them. There is downside you mentioned but I&nbsp;decided that&nbsp;since there is just one entry point for the property, it's easy to add it when the rule is implemented.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
