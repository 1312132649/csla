Not only did my cover protect my bag from the airplane grime, but I was able to spot my bag in seconds on the luggage conveyor. I will definitely purchase more luggage armour for the rest of my luggage... Janelle Green (Eureka, CA.). I&rsquo;ve wasted a lot of money, and lost many covers through the TSA inspection process. With the Luggage Armour tether strap, it keeps the cover connected to the bag and I haven&rsquo;t lost a cover since.
