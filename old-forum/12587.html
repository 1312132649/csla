<p>I am giving serious thought to replacing this current forum with a new and more modern set of software.</p>
<p>This forum runs on something called Community Server, and has gotten quite &quot;long in the tooth&quot;. You might notice that it looks somewhat old, doesn&#39;t work well on phones, and spam is an increasing problem. What you _can&#39;t_ see is that behind the scenes fewer and fewer features are actually working at an admin level.</p>
<p>In other words, the current software is approaching any reasonable end of its life.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t yet know what I&#39;ll use to replace it, and if you have any suggestions of great/inexpensive forum hosting please let me know.</p>
<p>I _am_ considering using something called Discourse, which is a new open source forum project on GitHub. It looks like I can host it in Azure for a relatively small cost - hopefully low enough that the ads on the site will pay for the hosting.</p>
<p>I&#39;m open to comments/thoughts/suggestions - this is your community as much as mine, and I value your input.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Monday, April 14, 2014</h2><p>I think one aspect that would be very important and useful is the ability to somehow convert over the existing messages.&nbsp; I vaguely remember the switch to this one a number of years ago and I believe there wasn&#39;t a conversion of existing messages.</p>
<p>I have never run a message board, so I don&#39;t know how viable that is, but sure would be important in my eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, April 14, 2014</h2><p>Yeah, that&#39;s a real issue, and not an easy thing to resolve. As you can imagine, there aren&#39;t any standards for these things, so moving messages from one software package to another would mean writing an export/import app of some sort.</p>
<p>A more likely solution is for me to turn this forum into a read-only repo for a few months as we all transition to the new forum.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>thaehn replied on Wednesday, April 16, 2014</h2><p>I have often found posts that are years old still helpful when researching issues.</p>

I&#39;d recommend giving that a try.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
