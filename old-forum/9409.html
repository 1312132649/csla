<p>There are strings that are required in the child object only when the parent object has a property set to some specific value.</p>

<p>How would I perform validation in this sceneario?</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement an internal method on the child that calls BusinessRules.CheckRules(). The child object&#39;s rules obviously interact with Parent to find that value you mention.</li>
<li>Implement a rule that calls this internal method on the child, and attach that rule to the parent object&#39;s property, so when the important property is changed, this rule is run and it calls the internal method on the child, which runs the rules in the child.</li>
</ol>
