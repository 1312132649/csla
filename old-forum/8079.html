If you want the grid to automatically save the objects, then you need to use an EditableRootListBase derived class (which still is not going to delete the unmodified row).<br /><br />I'm not familiar with the GridView control, but the grid in the control suite I use (DevExpress) does not call AddNew on the bound list until you actually type or select a new value on the new record row. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, December 03, 2009</h2><P>CSLA does automatically remove a new item from the grid - if the grid interacts with data binding correctly.</P>
<P>Typically the user needs to press ESC to cancel the new row, and that will remove it from the datagrid. But different datagrid controls work in different ways.</P>
<P>CSLA doesn't really care about the datagrid - it cares that the UI calls the right data binding methods to trigger the correct behavior.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Thursday, December 03, 2009</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div><P>CSLA does automatically remove a new item from the grid - if the grid interacts with data binding correctly.</P><br /><P>Typically the user needs to press ESC to cancel the new row, and that will remove it from the datagrid.

How is this done? <br /><br />(Of course it makes sense that pressing Esc or some similar key implemented by the grid for explicitly cancelling the edit should work properly)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
