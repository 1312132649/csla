<P><FONT face=Arial>I have implemented the basic principles of the CSLA framework and all worked well.&nbsp; However, lately I have become aware that each time I ask&nbsp;a BO to retrieve me some data from the server it increases the memory a bit. This is obviously normal since it has now collected the data. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>However, when the BO moves itself through to the client I would have expected this memory to be released but it isn't!&nbsp; Each subsequent new BO request increases the memory consumption until I&nbsp;eventually run out of it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Any ideas from anyone?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Thanks</FONT></P>
