But I feel like I&#39;m missing something or something hasn&#39;t &#39;clicked&#39; in my understanding how to execute the CRUD statements w the CSLA WCF Silverlight. I was wondering if something could give me an example that is more thorough than the csla examples given? I&#39;m not sure if I should be using the csladataproviders, the WCF datasources, or create a whole SL Library the mimics the .net Library created (that way is really confusing btw)? I&#39;m so confused. I would prefer the easiest less headache route, which I thought would be the WCF datasources, but I don&#39;t understand on how to execute the WCFPortalClient and what it all needs. Please help.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, December 07, 2011</h2><p>The 4.1 ProjectTracker is quite good. So is the SimpleNTier sample.</p>
<p>The best source of answers/recommendations is the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series, specifically the book on the data portal and the book on WPF/Silverlight.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
