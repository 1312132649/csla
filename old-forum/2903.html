<P>Is it possible for ReceiptInfo to be a child of Receipt without using a list.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I tried adding&nbsp;ReceptInfo as a property of Receipt and Windows.forms databinding does not show any of Receipt Infos properties.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

But data binding won't automatically understand what you are trying to do, so you'll have to put them on the form separately I suppose.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
