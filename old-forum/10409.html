<p>I&#39;m still using 3.8.x and would take the plunge to 4.x if that helps fix the issues.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting errors such as can&#39;t create my childBO (reflection errors) where the childBo is a property of the main BORoot</p>
<p>Most of my BO&#39;s are exposed via my implementation of MyViewModel&lt;T&gt; : ViewModel&lt;T&gt;&nbsp; etc.</p>
<p>as well as this pops up all the time:</p>
<p>Could not load the assembly AlexanderGracie.Library because the following errors occured:</p>
<p>Could not load type &#39;Csla.DataPortalClient.WcfProxy&#39;1 from assembly &#39;Csla, Version=3.8.2.0, ....</p>
<p>Could not load type &#39;Csla.Silverlight.ViewModel&#39;1 from assembly &#39;Csla, Version=3.8.2.0,...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

If so, it shouldn&#39;t try to create the model.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can use XAML markup to provide mock data for use at design time, instead of using the actual data source.</p>
<p>Or both.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
