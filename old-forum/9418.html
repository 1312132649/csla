<p>I am working with CSLA.NET 4. Now I have the fallowing problem:</p>
<p>I have a EditableRootObject which has several Rules. In the Fetch-Method, I load the properties with the LoadProperty()-Method. I have now seen, that this not check the rules that they are inital broken (when no value is set and there is a Required-Rule). Know my question: Should I load all values with SetProperty()? - Or is there another way, that the Rules are initial broken?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Best Regards, Thomas</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, August 21, 2010</h2><p>Just call BusinessRules.CheckRules() at the bottom of your fetch method.</p>
<p>CSLA does this for you after the create method completes - because you almost always want to check the rules for a new object. But it doesn&#39;t do this by default for a fetch, because many applications implicitly trust whatever data they just got from the database and running the rules would be unnecessary overhead.</p>
<p>However, it is also quite common to need the rules to run at the end of a fetch - and so you can just call BusinessRules.CheckRules() to make that happen.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
