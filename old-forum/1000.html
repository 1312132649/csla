<P>Seems&nbsp;I have to create the BO in the app_code directory, while the rest of my objects reside in a separate project - no big deal. Problem is that I cannot get the object to appear in the datasources window at design-time.&nbsp;BTW, object inherits from ReadOnlyBase wihich has some properties but also holds a collection class (from ReadonlyListBase) for the lines.</P>
<P>Have even tried using the ObjectAdapter to create a dataset from this - still no joy.</P>
<P>Without being able to see the various properties, I can't use the IDE to put the fields onto the report in design mode, and don't see another way to make them available.</P>
<P>Other than manually creating datasets from a datareader, I can't see a way forward.</P>
<P>Anyone have any suggestions?</P>
<P>Cheers,</P>
<P>Peter</P>
