<P>I have just downloaded CSLA .NET and gotten the sample application to build.</P>
<P>When I start the Web application, I get the forms authentication box and I fill it in.&nbsp; Then I get an error from DataPorta.Fetch saying "an attempt to attach an auto-named database for file C:\CSLA\csla20\ProjectRacker20vb\Security.mdf failed. A database with the same name exists or specified file can not be opened or it is located on UNC share".</P>
<P>When I look it Windows Explorer my database is there......</P>
<P>Any ideas are welcome. I'm really looking forward to CSLA, but I need to get off square 1. Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bayu replied on Tuesday, November 21, 2006</h2>I have no experience in using mdf-datafiles directly from disk, so my answer may be a little more laborious than strictly necessary:<br><br>- get Microsoft\'s SqlServer Management Studio Express<br>- this tool will allow you to manage your local data sources<br>- attach the mdf files (both of them) to your system<br>- (quick and dirty, but certainly not a best practice for client installations) give your ASPNET and IUSR_&lt;your-pc-name&gt; ownership rights to both DBs<br>- modify the both connection strings of your Remotinghost and/or Webservicehost into something like this:<br><br>Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=&lt;databasename&gt;;Integrated Security=True<br><br>You can find these settings in the Web.Config or App.Config files of the respective projects.<br><br><br>Hope this gets you to square 2, <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /><br>Bayu<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Tuesday, November 21, 2006</h2>The problem is that this procedure "attaches" the DBs to your sql server instance.<br>You probably have a database named "Security" in your sql server instance. You could attach the db with another name and change the connection strings so that it won't conflict with your existing ones.<br>You can do this by hand in you sql server management studio and then change the connection strings to use connect to your instance as you do regularily.<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>IraD replied on Tuesday, November 21, 2006</h2><P>Yes, more or less, this is what I have done. Now I am on to step 2!</P>
<P>The Windows app works!!! </P>
<P>I have copied the databases into App_Data.</P>
<P>The Web app gets a data portal error immediately after apparently succesful login - "DataPortal.Fetch (Of PTIdentity) (New Criteria(Username,password))" fails saying it's an invalid instance. </P>
<P>Hmmm...</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
