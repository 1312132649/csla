<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a question about Business Rule / validation Declaration and Location ?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; read from http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4BusinessRulesSubsystem.aspx , </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read that a business rule is declare as a private class on Business Object, that location is a regulation or just guide ? ( what are the considerations needed to declare a Rule ? as a nested class or as independent class so that it can be used by another object ? )</p>
<p>2. If I declare as independent class, is it needed a Serialize attribute ? for moving across tiers / layers ? and Why ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could anyone explain me around this concept , anything suggestion is welcome :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Rules does not have to be serializable. </p>
<p>BrokenRule (builtin class in Csla used in BrokenRulesCollection) is serializable so it can move between tiers just like any other child list in a business object. </p>
<p>A rule instance is registered for all instance of a given business object type. As such - the rule should be considered a &quot;singelton&quot; and can not contain any poperties that are specific for the code in Execute method. </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
