<P>I have this webpage with two grdiviews, on reloading the second gridview based on the first loses its data. Is there a way to reselect the row in gridview 1 using session variables,and after that raising a selectobject event . The session part is not the real problem, and setting the correct row neither, but the second gridview with selected data won't refresh.</P>
<P>I don't really know what to do, i&nbsp; don't want to use history back cause i don't use the cache.</P>
<P>Thank's for any advice.</P>
<P>Databind is the way to go, but i still miss something somewhere.</P>
<P>Goodbye</P>
