<P>All 3 combo boxes are bound to the same base object, different properties.&nbsp; When I change Combo1, it populates the datasources for the other 2 (they are identical, but I set up separate data sources to be safe, for now).&nbsp;&nbsp; <EM>**All of the bindings are set to OnPropertyChanged*</EM>* as the DataBinding setup.</P>
<P>The first combo has the EditValueChanged event, which is what this logic goes in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under certain conditions, the event is fired twice, once by Combo1, and then again when I change the EditValue of Combo2 or 3.</P>
<P>Combo1_EditValueChanged</P>
<P>Some unrelated logic<BR>bindingSource2.datasource = (get new data)<BR>bindingSource3.datasource = (get new data)<BR>Combo2.EditValue = ""&nbsp; '-- already has a value<BR>Combo2.EditValue = ""&nbsp; '-- already has a value<BR>^^^ one of these two somehow triggers Combo1_EditValueChanged again</P>
<P>1) Select a value in combo1 - EditValueChanged fires, everything OK<BR>2) Select a value in combo2 (popuplated normally, this is the first time)<BR>3) Change the value in combo1<BR>4) EditValueChanged is fired<BR>5) In EditValueChanged :&nbsp;combo2&nbsp;= "", which somehow causes the event to fire again<BR></P>
<P>The issue is that when the event is fired for the 2nd time, the EditValue of Combo1 is somehow reset to the original!&nbsp; During all of this, the underlying value of the object is *never* set to the EditValue.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems, when I trace through it, that calling the Value="" on Comb2 causes the proper property on the underlying object to be set, but immediatly after that I get another call to the OTHER property, the one for combo 1, which is the original value.</P>
<P>Is there some way that I can handle this, or something that I am doing wrong?&nbsp; I was hoping that EditValue would be posted to the object by the time this was done.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I doubt this is a DevExpress thing, but I wasn't sure.&nbsp; I have the BindingSourceRefresh control on the form, and I do need to have the OnPropertyChanged set for the databindings.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
