I'm getting the same error when trying to build the latest VB version of CSLA (2.1.4) in VMWare 5.5.3 (Win XP SP2 guest and host, VS 2005 SP1 Team Developer). I've narrowed it down to using VM shared folders as the location for the project files - if I copy them to the guest OS's C: drive then it builds fine - so obviously a problem with VMWare and not CSLA. However, I have always used shared folders for my other projects, but then they do not include web services and such fancy stuff (still a noob when it comes to .NET let alone CSLA!) I just wondered if you found a brilliantly simple solution (well, I can dream can't I?)<br>TIA, The Professor.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
