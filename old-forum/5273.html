<p>Fix?</p></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br>The property value is not changing because nothing is triggering the databinding to send the new value into the object. The binding for the textbox is probably set to happen OnValidation. A quick way to fix this is probably to change the databinding mode to OnPropertyChanged. You can do this in "Advanced" for databinding of the textbox.<br><br>I think it would be better for your color dialog to change the value of the object property rather than the textbox. The databinding will then update the textbox. That's how I do this kind of thing. In general, I think if a control is bound to an object, you're best not to change that control any other way. Let it pull the data back from the object.<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
