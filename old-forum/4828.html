<p class=MsoNormal><span>Yes, you are fine to use BLB for both objects.&nbsp; As a matter
of fact, I have never used ERLB because I always use single save button for
entire set of data on a single form/control.&nbsp; ERLB does not work for this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Thanks for quick response. <br>
I think I get the idea. I'm currently working on a form (WinForms app) where I
have two panes (upper is master, lower is detail, standard approach). I'm using
BLBs for both panes, because I want everything to be saved upon form closing in
one transaction. Is this ok to NOT use ERLB in upper (master) pane here?<br>

</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>maxal replied on Tuesday, May 13, 2008</h2><P>Excellent. Reading this post I realized that while I was using BusinesBaseList what I really need is EditableRootListBase since this is exactly what I am doing.</P>
<P>So, I tried to switch to EditableRootListBase and found two things. One is good and another is not so good.</P>
<P>1. Good thing. In my approach I had to call ISavable.Save manually, and not it's called automatically when ApplyEdit is called</P>
<P>2. Bad thing. We are working with local database, and our <FONT size=2><FONT color=#2b91af>ApplicationContext</FONT>.AutoCloneOnUpdate </FONT><FONT size=3>method property is set to fase, so no cloning. Now, I cannot avoid that cloning since that what EditableRootListBase does.</FONT></P>
<P>So, the question is why would I need to clone with local database? Can I avoid it somehow?</P>

Serializing is comparably heavy operation to be used just to know what can be&nbsp;wrong should I decide to switch to remote data portal. I will think about that, but now I am inclined to remove cloning from EditableRootListBase.</P>
<P>BTW, if I really decide to move remote data portal, the cloning will still be there, right. Which will be absolutely useless since remote data portal will serialize the object late anyway.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, May 13, 2008</h2>Well, specfically in ERLB the reason for the clone is so the user isnt' left with an invalid object displayed in the row.&nbsp; I should have mentioned that before.&nbsp; Imagine what happens if the save fails half way though; you no longer have a valid object for the user to edit.&nbsp; The clone at least gives you the object in the state before the save was attempted.<br><br>If you move to remoting, the clone occurs because the instance is serialized and sent over the wire.&nbsp; It's not cloned and then serialized; that would be useless, because when the call returns you are going to get a new object, no way around it.<br><br>So the cloning done in local mode is there so that the objects behave consistently no matter what data portal is used.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>maxal replied on Tuesday, May 13, 2008</h2>OK, I see the point.
