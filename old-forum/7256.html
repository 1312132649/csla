<P>I don't think it will work though. RegisterProperty() is static, and the async callback code needs to run in the context of your actual business object instance, otherwise it can't have that instance raise PropertyChanged to tell the rest of the world that there's actually a property value there.</P>
<P>In fact, the getMethod would need to be attached to your instance, or it couldn't get/set the property values.</P>
<P>The majority of the code you are referencing deals with calling the factory method, and so is exactly the same as what you'd write to do sync lazy loading. The only difference is the 3-4 lines dealing with the async callback, which has very little variation.</P>
<P>But if you can prototype a more streamlined solution, I'm certainly open to it.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
