CSLA is handling all that (state etc.) very good and I don't care for the redundency of the states by NHibernate.<br><br>then I came across CasteProject Active Records. although its based on NHibernate its successfully hides most of the session handling (sure with some restriction - lazy loading again - but i think that good enough for me).<br><br>So, before I'm gonna try it myself and spent much time on it. anyone has experinace with intergtaring CSLA and Active Records?<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
