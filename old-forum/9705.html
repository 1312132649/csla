I understand that BusinessBindingListBase is the WinForms replacement of the BusinessListBase because there were incompatibilities between binding lists in WinForms and other Web UIs. </p>
<p>So I would like to use the framework and update the list objects according to the tools design, but I cannot find the FieldManager instance or any other obvious replacement. </p>
<p>Any suggestions? </p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 03, 2010</h2><p>FieldManager is in BusinessBase. The list base classes are containers for other objects, and don&#39;t allow properties - or at least don&#39;t support them through something like FieldManager.</p>
<p>BusinessListBase is for everything except Windows Forms, and BusinessBindingListBase is for Windows Forms. But BusinessBase works across all the technologies.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
