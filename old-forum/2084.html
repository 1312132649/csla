<P>I have a form that uses the FormView control to display and edit my BO.&nbsp; One of the properties contains the Guid id value of an item in a lookup list.&nbsp; I have a CslaDataSource control for both the object instance and another for the lookup list.&nbsp; The DropDownControl appears as:</P>
<P><CODE>&lt;asp:DropDownList ID="ManufacturingPlantDropDown" runat="server" DataSourceID="ManufacturingPlantsDataSource" DataTextField="Name" DataValueField="UniqueID" SelectedValue='&lt;%# Bind("ManufacturingPlant") %&gt;' Width="100%"&gt;&lt;/asp:DropDownList&gt; </CODE></P>
<P>This is the case in all three view templates (Edit, Item &amp; Insert) with the exception that the Eval statement is used in the ItemTemplate.</P>
<P>The ManufacturingPlant property in my BO defaults to System.Guid.Empty when a new instance is created; however, there is no record in the table with this identifier so I get an exception.</P>
<P>What is the best way to do this for properties that are optional and/or nullable?&nbsp; I can't have it default to an existing value because that would require a lookup each time&nbsp;an object is created.&nbsp; And, if the property's value is optional, then I wouldn't want it to possess a legitimate value unless the user has explicitly set it.</P>
<P>Any suggestions?</P>

If nulls are allowed, then i just change the text to "None" or something similar, but the approach is the same.<br>I also check for empty guids before calling the db in order to see if i should send the guid or a null.<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
