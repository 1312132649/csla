Correct me if I'm wrong, but while this is true for fetch, create and delete scenarios, there's only one DataPortal_Update() and one DataPortal_Insert(). The dp will choose which one to call according to IsNew.<br><br>So insert and update have no criteria, they are called right after you call Save().<br>What you can do is have different methods that you can call from DataPortal_Update() depending on data that the object contains, like:<br><br>Protected Overrides Sub DataPortal_Update()<br>If mValue = 1 Then<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UpdateV1()<br>Else<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UpdateV2()<br>End If <br>End Sub<br><br><br><br>Andr√©s</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, October 06, 2006</h2>right... was typing faster than I was thinking.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
