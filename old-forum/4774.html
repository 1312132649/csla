<P>I have come to an empass in terms of how much I like the use of the Browsable attribute for defining whether or not a field/property should be mapped by the DataMapper. The more I move along in my project, I find that perhaps the use of this attribute in this fashion is more of a convenience thing than a good design (just attempting to spark the discussion).</P>
<P>We all know what the intent of the Browsable attribute is, IE. creating custom components and defining whether or not items are viewable in the designer. This creates a caveat with the CSLA's use of the attribute.</P>
<P>For example, I have classes that have a derived property based on the current culture of the application. I have a propery for an English description and a property for a French description (retrieved from database). I have a DTO with those fields and I map the object nicely to the corresponding fields BO-&gt;DTO-&gt;BO from server to client.</P>
<P>When binding my list to things like a data grid, I need to specify to the data grid to bind to either english or French depending on the client's culture specification. What I have done is created another property called CultureSpecificDescription which returns either the English or French Description based on current thread culture.</P>
<P>What I don't want to do is have custom code in my BO to case on culture when retrieving the BO data. I want to keep the pattern very simple and since we allow our users to change the culture on the fly, I don't want to have to retrieve from the database each time.</P>
<P>So, what I have done is created&nbsp; a custom attribute called Mappable and replaced the implementatio that checks for IsBrowsable with IsMappable on the new attribute. Of course, I had to apply this attribute to other areas in the CSLA Base objects.</P>
<P>By using this custom attribute, I can select my public properyt at design time for data binding where Browsable hides the property.</P>
<P>This might be more academic as there are different ways to solve the problem. I am just curious to know if anyone else has come accross this type of issue? It would seem that the proper solution is a custom attribute instead of using the Browsable attribute for something that it may not have been entirely intended for??</P>
<P>Looking forward to any feedback.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
