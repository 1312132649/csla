<P>Since you are already familiar with CSLA, if you read Rocky's chapter on implementing project tracker in ASP.NET and review the project tracker code, this will give you a real nice start on how to cleanly implement CSLA in ASP.NET forms.&nbsp; Mainly you are just wiring the Business Objects to the UI and doing data binding.</P>
<P>Microsoft is releasing a new web MVC framework that will provide more of a traditional web development experience, giving the developer more control (and potentially more work to do) to implement web applications.&nbsp; It does not have abstractions such as viewstate, etc..&nbsp; There is a post with an example CSLA implementation here:</P>
<P><A HREF="/forums/thread/24785.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/24785.aspx</A></P>
<P>Finally, you can consider Silverlight...this would allow you to leverage some of your WinForms skills for the web, but is does have a bit of a learning curve to it.&nbsp; Rocky and his team have done a lot of work in this area and the CSLA implementation for Silverlight would save you a lot of time.</P>
<P>In general I would recommend if you want to get into web development to learn some of the basics around the HTTP protocol, the tiers involved,&nbsp;and the stateless nature of the web.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do web development well, it really is important that you learn and embrace these concepts.</P>
<P>Hope that helps...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>matt tag replied on Friday, November 14, 2008</h2><font size="2" face="Verdana">thanks for the info.&nbsp; How does WPF fit into all of this?&nbsp; Since I made my original post, I started reading up on WPF, which looks promising for web development.&nbsp; Is it true that WPF web development is much simpler than ASP.NET?<br><br>As for MVC, this looks even newer.
