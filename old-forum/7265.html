But in Silverlight&nbsp;3 RTW it seems they removed the designer completely, this because not to delay Silverlight 3 outroll.<BR><BR>Gladly it isn't gone,&nbsp;a preview designer is still available, but just hidden.<BR><BR>When u have an xaml open in silverlight:</P>
<P>- move your mouse down in the xaml workspace;<BR>- there is a very small spot where your cursor becommes a vertical splitter:<BR>- move the splitter up&nbsp;and an disabled designer&nbsp;becomes visible;<BR>- hit "reload the designer"<BR><BR>There a limited designer becomes available, just for previewing :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mark Richardson replied on Monday, July 13, 2009</h2><DIV>Thanks for posting this, I was wondering did they remove the designer for 3.0.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>I thought it was a ploy by MS to get you to buy Expression Blend for design support.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Monday, July 13, 2009</h2>I dont even use the designer in regular WPF let alone silverlight (slow).  I remember early on I played with WPF and did the whole drag and drop with the designer.  Then when silverlight2 came out I thought my VS was broken when I could'nt to the same in SL.  It turns out that the "designer" in SL was readonly.   Is it still like this is SL3?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Tuesday, July 14, 2009</h2><P>It's readonly yes, just for preview.</P>
<P>In VS2010 there'll be a better designer (they say)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
