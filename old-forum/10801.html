Our remote host are dedicated to this service only and do not perform any other function.</p>
<p>The only&nbsp;optimization&#39;s we&#39;ve done so far is to exclude certain directories from the virus scan application.</p>
<p>Any info would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />John&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
