<P>GUID values are great for data where you are inserting, updating and deleting rows on a regular basis, especially if you need to use replication or anything like that.</P>
<P>But lookup tables rarely fit that scenario. They are usually quite static and are rarely altered. Even when using replication or synchronization, it is relatively unlikely that you'd allow the lists to be changed anywhere but your master database.</P>
<P>But as I say, I'm not a db expert, and others may have better educated views.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Wednesday, March 14, 2007</h2><P>The only advantage you may gain in using GUIDs is that every one of your different lookups would have an absolutely unique identifier.</P>
<P>So you could, if you wanted, get just one of them individually.&nbsp; If that's a requirement for you, then you're fine.&nbsp; But that is not typical lookup-type NVL lists behaviour.</P>
<P>So I would probably agree that they are overkill.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dshafer replied on Wednesday, March 14, 2007</h2><P>I was pretty sure I would get that answer, but I just wanted to get somebody else to shoot it down so I didn't have too <img src="/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad [:(]" />.&nbsp; I think the reason I went that way&nbsp;is that the CodeSmith templates created an NVL with a &lt;Guid,String&gt; combination, but I may be wrong.&nbsp; At any rate, looks like I'll be changing to integers.&nbsp; Thanks for the confirmation.</P>

<P>When designing NVL lists for binding in a windows application I initially used long integers and could&nbsp;not get them to bind &nbsp;correctly to comboboxes for lookups. Eventually I found the binding only worked&nbsp;in my &nbsp;windows forms app if I changed the key to integers. I presumed this to be some failure in casting behind the scenes. By reverting to integers you will probably find your business objects more flexible in terms of UI otions.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
