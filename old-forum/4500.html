<P>I have added a FilteredBindingList to on of my business objects. When I try to run my code I am now getting serialization errors because of the FilteredBindingList. School_ER and Student_EC are serializable. I've added the NonSerialized attribute to the private FilteredBindingList member to see if it&nbsp;would correct the issue but I still get the error.</P>
<P>The&nbsp;filtered list&nbsp;shouldn't be serialized, just the main list of students so the NonSerialized attribute seemed logical&nbsp;.</P>
<P>Basically I need a school object that manages ALL students. However, my user interface needs to see different lists of students (filtered by class). So I am creating a filtered binding list inside of school for which I can change the filter property as necessary and any controls it's bound to will show the proper subset of students.</P>
<P>At any time I only want a student object in memory once so I can't just instantiate a new list using a different filter.</P>
<P>Here is the actual error</P>
<P>"Type 'Csla.FilteredBindingList`1[[Business.Student_EC, Business, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null]]' in Assembly 'Csla, Version=3.0.3.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=93be5fdc093e4c30' is not marked as serializable."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>Fwiw, FBL is really designed to be created/used by the UI developer more than the business object developer.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>wjcomeaux replied on Monday, March 17, 2008</h2><P>Thanks Rocky:</P>
<P>Yes, I realize that is the intention of the FBL, however having it inside my BO for this particular scenario actually makes sense.</P>
<P>Thanks again,</P>
