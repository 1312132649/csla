<p>One way I see to do it would be to put the results of a proc call into a permanent table, then generate the business object from that table and indicate that I want to use a stored proc in the generator UI.&nbsp; Or just create the business objects manually.&nbsp; I&#39;m hoping there is a third option -- any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>What code generator are you using? CslaGenFork can generate NameValueList and ReadOnly collections from stored procedures and views.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CraigJ replied on Wednesday, August 07, 2013</h2><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; We are using CodeSmith 6.5.&nbsp; Is there any custom template that you are aware of for Code Smith?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Wednesday, August 07, 2013</h2><p>Sorry.
