<p class="MsoNormal">Well, I just finished building some small utilities using
the CSLA 3.8.2</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I followed the video instructions on how to configure my
application server using WCF hosting for my three tier deployment (IIS 6).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At first, everything appeared to work fine, but once I
started stressing up the system a little bit, I started to get multiple errors.
I don&rsquo;t get the errors all the time, some times everything works fine and other
times (after doing the exact same thing) I get any one of the errors listed
below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am *really* pressed for time right now so before I start
googleing all over the place and making all kinds of changes to my config files
etc. I was wondering if one or some of you guys have experience similar issues
and what you did to fix them. Any help is greatly appreciated. Here are the
errors that I am getting:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">---------</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The socket connection was aborted. This could be caused by
an error processing your message or a receive timeout being exceeded by the
remote host, or an underlying network resource issue. Local socket timeout was
&#39;00:01:00&#39;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">---------</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The underlying connection was closed: A connection that was
expected to be kept alive was closed by the server.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">---------</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The HTTP service located at http://xxx.yyy.com/WCFTest/WcfPortal.svc
is too busy.</p>
