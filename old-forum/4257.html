Meaning that the OnDataPortalInvokeComplete event would be run in the case of a security exception. I would have thought that this would be outside this main try catch meaning that the OnDataPortalInvokeComplete would not run.<BR>There is probably a valid reason why you would want this inside it but to me i would not want OnDataPortalInvokeComplete to run in the event of a security failure. As i said i might be wrong but just food for thought.<BR>Anthony </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 30, 2008</h2><P>You are suggesting that the event be raised in all cases except for a SecurityException?</P>
<P>That seems like a slippery slope, because I can imagine people coming up with other exceptions they'd want to exclude too. Perhaps a network timeout exception, or other transportal failure exceptions. Some of which might be data portal channel specific.</P>
<P>Or am I missing what you are worried about?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vdhant replied on Wednesday, January 30, 2008</h2>Ya i can see what you can mean about the security exception being the only one if it was excluded and i guess if you use the event in question if you dont want to run specific logic if a security exception is raised you dont have to.<BR><BR>Just wanted to check.<BR>Anthony </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
