<P>Rocky needs an easy, dollar-free and labor-free way to deliver that information to us.</P>
<P>Perhaps he could set up a single thread (preferably that only he and hand-picked users could post to) that would be used as a master notification thread.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to know about security problems could enable email notifications from that thread.&nbsp; The actual details should be posted in other threads, just a brief description and the link to the detailed thread would suffice.</P>
<P>The same idea might also work for bugs and bug-fixes...</P>

<P>I just checked your issue log.</P>
<P>There is a major difference between "This is a developer-oriented feature I would like to improve" and "This is a serious security issue that will let someone hack into your computer and view or destroy your data when using CSLA."</P>
<P>Some of us work for customers who REALLY, REALLY need to care about such issues...</P>
<P>I would ask that you split it up into two logs.&nbsp; That way, systems operation folks can subscribe to the security issue feed and developers can subscribe to both.&nbsp; I can assure you that most system operations staff will not want to (and therefore will not) read a log that is largely composed of developer issues.&nbsp; Not right, but there it is. :(</P>
<P>And if you say to yourself, "Gee, the above two paragraphs are somewhat contradictory, aren't they?&nbsp; I mean, if the system operations folks really cared, they would read up on this stuff!"</P>
<P>Welcome to the real world, and console yourself that with this change to your issues log your tax dollars will be better spent...&nbsp; :)</P>

It is a by-product of my books that happens to be very useful to many people, either as-is, or modified to suit specific needs.<br><br>If I make a product out of it, then you could expect real product sorts of things, like support around security issues, etc. Those things would be available to organizations that purchase the productized version. A number of people have asked me to productize CSLA .NET, for exactly this sort of reason. Maybe that'll happen.<br><br>However, right now I am not aware of any security issues with CSLA .NET. Were I to create this "security issue log" it would be empty. If you are aware of some non-.NET security issue with CSLA .NET itself,
I'll be happy to log it. And I'll even be happy to log it in its own
article - I have no issue with that. You'll have to deal with the
singular RSS feed though - I won't have time to change the RSS feed to
support per-article concepts in the near future.<br><br>Note: I am NOT going down any road where I'm logging issues with Remoting, SSL, web services, WCF, Enterprise Services, reflection or any other .NET technology. That's what TechNet is for, and your IT people almost certainly have subscriptions to that.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>malloc1024 replied on Monday, November 06, 2006</h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Please

<P>I don't intend to.&nbsp; Rocky doesn't have to be the one to do the work.&nbsp; :)</P>
<P>My suggestion was to use this forum in a very specific way, one that does not require Rocky to do any additional work at all.&nbsp; I probably wasn't clear enough, so I'll try to explain.</P>
<P>All we need is a single thread on this site that acts as a reference to any other security-related thread.&nbsp; If write-access to that thread can be limited to a&nbsp;number of individuals, then it will stay a bit better organized, but that isn't essential.&nbsp; I would be happy to help keep it up-to-date.</P>
<P>Here's an example of what I have in mind:</P>
<P>We set up a thread entitled "Master Index of Security Hole&nbsp;Related Threads".</P>
<P>The first message in it is as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>This thread is intended to act as a master thread to raise alerts on security&nbsp;holes in the CSLA framework that might let a hacker gain access to an application via a CSLA framework defect.</P>
<P><STRONG>Please read this message with your full attention&nbsp;before posting to this thread.</STRONG></P>
<P>People who are interested in being notified about any CSLA framework security issues should enable an email subscription to this thread.&nbsp; With a subscription to this thread, you can get notified of any security holes that </P>
<P>Here is what this thread is NOT:</P>
<OL>
<LI>This is NOT a thread about security issues in general.&nbsp; It is about security issues that are in the CSLA framework.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the problem isn't caused by the framework, we don't want to hear about it in this thread.</LI>
<LI>This is NOT a thread to ask questions about security.&nbsp; Period.</LI>
<LI>This is NOT a thread to ask questions about how to set up CSLA security.</LI>
<LI>This is NOT, repeat NOT a thread to discuss any&nbsp;security issue in any amount of detail.&nbsp; Each message is simply a pointer to another thread about CSLA security issues.</LI></OL>
<P>This&nbsp;IS a thread to simplify finding any and all threads that discuss security flaws in the CSLA framework that might let a hacker compromise your application.&nbsp; There are thousands of threads in this forum, this one just lets us organize critical security notifications into a single thread.</P>
<P>If you have found&nbsp;a security hole, you should:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Post the details in a DIFFERENT thread.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Each security issue that is found should have its own thread with all the detail needed.)&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Copy&nbsp;the URL for that thread's web page.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Create a new post in this master security thread</LI>
<LI>Paste the URL for the detailed thread in the body&nbsp;your post.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Add a few words describing the general nature of the security issue.&nbsp; Be brief, as the full thread for that issue should have all the details.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Make sure you mentioned the CSLA version and language you found the problem in.</LI>
<LI>That's it, you are done with your work in this thread - at least until you find a new security flaw.</LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks for clarifying the issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is actually a good idea.<span>&nbsp; </span>The person that maintains the security sticky
could be the person that maintains the FAQ sticky.<span>&nbsp; </span>You would want to limit the number of people
that could post to that thread.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise
you would end up with false alarms, reducing the overall effectiveness of the
thread.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 07, 2006</h2>I agree that this is a good idea. However, I would rather that "official" information about the framework be under www.lhotka.net. It isn't that big a deal for me to maintain the list of issues - I just have none, and so I don't see the need to create a security or infrastructure issues page that lists nothing.<br><br>Looking back, there's no doubt that the original post was intended with more humor (albiet somewhat biting), and I should have responded more in kind perhaps.<br><br>Nonetheless, I really have given thought to creating a parallel commercial version of the framework - much like the approach taken by JBoss and MySQL. The reason would be to specifically address some of these more formal product-oriented needs by organizations using the framework.<br><br>I started this thing nearly 11 years ago, purely with the intent of using it as a teaching tool. The "framework" was merely an illustration of concepts. But it is impossible to deny the reality of today, which is that the framework has become a thing unto itself, with a broad community of users of many sorts.<br><br>Some of these users, or potential users, require more than a community-based forum as a means of support. And they require more formalism around things like issue tracking (dev, security, infrastructure and more) than I am willing to provide pro bono.<br><br>I fully understand, and frankly share, the reservations around any sort of commercialization. If I did go down that road, I would most certainly do so as an option, not a requirement. I strongly believe in direct contribution to the industry and community - that's a large part of why CSLA is what it is today - and I wouldn't give that up just to serve a competing set of market requirements.<br><br>But if I can do both, I really may go down that road.<br><br>In any case, returning to the original topic, I am quite comfortable creating a specific security/infrastructure issues article on www.lhotka.net, and I'll gladly do that at the point I become aware of such issues.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Tuesday, November 07, 2006</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>I agree that this is a good idea.

<P>I think I can speak on behalf of&nbsp;all CSLAers by saying THANK YOU for all the hours you continue to provide pro bono.&nbsp; Like you, most of us have&nbsp;good demanding jobs...&nbsp;and wife and/or kids too.&nbsp; All that takes a huge chunk of our time on a daily basis and _you_ go beyond&nbsp;the call of duty by supporting CSLA every time you have a minute to spare.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>For this I thank you - and most of all I thank your wife and kids.&nbsp; I strongly believe that they play a big role as well, without their understanding and compassion you would be not able to commit as much time as you currently are to CSLA related stuff.</P>
