Hope i'm not wrong here with my question ;-).</P>
<P>A Businessobject have some ChildObjectLists. (Collections of other Businessobjects). This Childobjects are accessable via a Readonly Property in the "main" object. (Examle: A Voucher with a List of Positions)</P>
<P>I thinks this is the way it should be done. Now i have troubles with databinding in ASP.net. I could use a objectdatasource to bind my businessobject to a Formview. This works like a charme and i could Edit/Update and so on. Everything is fine. </P>
<P>I could also bind the "ChildCollection" to a Gridview in my Formview. But i have NO glue how to update this "clientcollection. <BR>Any idea to solve such requirments?</P>
<P>Best regards</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pfeds replied on Wednesday, May 14, 2008</h2><P>I know this is a fairly old post that hasn't been replied to, but I'm having similar difficulties at the moment with databinding the child collection to a GridView within a FormView.</P>
<P>I have a Product object with a child collection of ProductVariants (i.e. a product could be a table, and a variant could be a certain size of that table).</P>
<P>I'm creating a ProductEdit aspx page that will handle both inserting a Product or updating an existing one.</P>
<P>So... I have a FormView bound to a ProductDataSource.&nbsp; I want the product information at the top of the page, then a GridView which will allow adding/deleting product variants, and then finally a Save/Update button at bottom.</P>
<P>At present I can add items to the child gridview, but this means when I rebind the data then any properties I have set for the Product disappear (due to them not being saved to the object before the page refresh).&nbsp; That is unless I write code to get each TextBox from the FormView and update the properties one by one, which I would rather not do.</P>
<P>From looking at ProjectTracker&nbsp;I wondered if it would&nbsp;be a better option to have one datasource for the product and another datasource for the child objects in the GridView...?&nbsp; I can't see that resolving the issue or maybe I haven't considered something.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
