<P>I am new to CSLA 2.1 and trying to build my first WinForm Application so please be patient with me as some of the things I mention/ask maybe trivial to many of you here.</P>
<P>I would really appreciate if someone can help/guide me with my problem as I am not sure what the right/preferred way is to approach this issue.</P>
<P>I have WinForm with a Parent-Child-GrandChild relationship all use a DataGridView to Add/Edit/Delete rows.</P>
<P>e.g.</P>
<P>Customer (Parent) </P>
<P>Orders (Child)</P>
<P>OrderDetail (GrandChild)</P>
<P>To handle the Customer (Parent) in a DataGridView I have created two BO's</P>
<P>Customer from the EditableChild Template with the following Properties</P>
<P>ObjectName:Customer</P>
<P>ParentName:-</P>
<P>ChildCollectionNames:-</P>
<P>ChildPropertyNames:-</P>
<P>CustomerList from the EditableRootList Template with the following Properties</P>
<P>ChildName:Customer</P>
<P>ObjectName:CustomerList</P>
<P>The CustomerDataGridView.DataSource = CustomerBindingSource and the CustomerBindingSource.DataSource = CustomerList</P>
<P>The above seems to be ok and I can Add/Edit/Delete rows in the Grid. </P>
<P>How do I proceed in creating the Child/GrandChild Bo's </P>
<P>Should the Order and OrderList BO's be setup like the Customer and CustomerList and how should I relate the Customer to the Order or OrderList what about the OrderDetail and the OrderDetailList and how should I relate these as well. And finally how to tie up all these BO's in the WinForm.</P>
<P>I know this is a really long post but If someone can help me out I will really be greatful.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P>
