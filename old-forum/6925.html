Yes, it is extra work, but you'll be happier for it.</P>
<P>The data portal is an n-tier&nbsp;client/server technology, designed to transparently allow your application to talk to your application. </P>
<P>Using the data portal to allow some other application to talk to your application is just asking for trouble.</P>
<P>Inter-application communication is best handled using message-based models following a service-oriented architecture of some sort.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
