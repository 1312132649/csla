<P>A number of people volunteered up front to help, but I suspect the pressures of the economy and other factors made it impractical for all of them to really dig in, and so the end result is that there've been just three really active people working on this.</P>
<P>By far the most&nbsp;prolific contributor is Sean Rhone, and I want to recognize the great effort he's put into this project!! Rick Wilkerson and Paul Tyng have also put in some serious time on this effort, but Paul needs to step away due to other demands on his time.</P>
<P>This project is a lot of work. I estimate my dev team put in around&nbsp;5 or 6 man-months of effort going from version 3.5 to 3.6, though it is hard to say for sure. It was about 10 man-months total to create CSLA .NET for Silverlight, but a lot of the changes were made to CSLA .NET for Windows, so it could be more like 6-7 man-months of time went into 3.6.</P>
<P>My point is that I think it is 3-4 man-months of work to get the VB codebase from 3.5 to 3.6 - which can only happen with several active volunteers. Sean and Rick can't do this alone!!</P>
<P><STRONG>If you feel that you can help out on this conversion effort, please let me know - by replying here or emailing me directly.</STRONG></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
