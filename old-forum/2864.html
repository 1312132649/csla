<P>Thanks,<BR>Elliot</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, May 14, 2007</h2><P>Do you have any sort of circular reference in your object model (direct or indirect)? Most common would be a parent reference of some sort, but sibling references can be circular as well.</P>
<P>If that is the case, n-level undo will go into an infinite loop.</P>
<P>To resolve the issue, use the NotUndoable attribute on an appropriate field to break the circular reference chain.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>eslater replied on Tuesday, May 15, 2007</h2>I think I have NotUndoable on all of my parent references but I guess I need to go in and check for other possibilities since it seems like this must be the case.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
