I can do it via property and databinding or via event handling. Events always seemed a little more cumbersome and maintenance heavy to me.</P>
<P>I have an idea to use a 32 bit int value to hold a bit array each bit initialized to 0 (false) and use the property&nbsp;for each public field to help set the HasValue property of the field to true if it's not null. So that means there'd be a public property for each of the used bit fields, but it would not require a lot of interaction and databinding would allow the display color to change automatically. Now the form processes a lot of changes on each field, I've seen the same event fire up to 5 times for one change/check. It just seems a waste.</P>
<P>Has anyone&nbsp;got an opinion or&nbsp;tried something like this? I'm wondering if the benefit is worth the code.</P>

<P>What you are describing certainly isn't something that should be in your business object - as it is a pure UI artifact. So the solution should reside in the UI, and Microsoft provides this extender control concept exactly for this type of issue.</P>
<P>You can look at Chapter 5 to see how I implemented the ReadWriteAuthorization control for some ideas, and there are other examples of extender controls on the web as well.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>esteban404 replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2><P>Thanks for that Extender Control bit &lt;s&gt; of information. I just asked about writing extender controls for a web project.&nbsp;I don't see why it'd be a big deal for Windows forms. Guess I just never thought of it.</P>
