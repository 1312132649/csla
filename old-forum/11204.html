<p>barryfz</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, March 01, 2012</h2><p>ProjectTracker is primarily driven by the books I write. There is no Web Forms book, so there was no effort to update the related sample.</p>
<p>Additionally what I&#39;ve learned over the years is that including non-working samples is a bad thing. So if I didn&#39;t have time to confirm it worked, I removed it. Hence it is gone.</p>
<p>The upside is that Web Forms hasn&#39;t changed in any meaningful way since 2005. Nor has the way CSLA supports Web Forms. That means the 3.x sample is perfectly fine to use as a start point, and the <em>Expert 2008 Business Objects</em> book remains the best documentation for Web Forms. apps.</p>
<p>That will change with .NET 4.5, because there are a bunch of new features in Web Forms, and some of them will probably have minor impact on CSLA and the way you use CSLA objects to create a Web Forms app. As a result, there&#39;ll almost certainly be a Web Forms project in the 4.5 version of ProjectTracker.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
