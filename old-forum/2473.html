<P>If I am creating a NewProject I notice it says to do this in NewProject</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return DataPortal.Create(of project)()</P>
<P>When I look&nbsp;in the DataAccess I see (page #425)...</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overloads of DataPortal_Create(byval criteria as criteria)</P>
<P>I am confused because, I am never passing a criteria object. In my real example I simply want to create a new Project, at most I want to give the project an ID. Am I missing something simple?</P>

<P>So page 422 has no parameters. And page 425 has 1 parameter. You can create whatever set of parameters you need. But typically you would create various criteria objects. All of mine are in an external resource so I only create them once and use them across many BOs - they inherit from the CSLA CriteriaBase class.</P>
<P>Rocky recently change the way the framework works to line up the calls correctly and consistently. You can read about the changes in his blog and new eBook.</P>

I will have to get the lastest greatest CSLA version and the eBook. Thanks for responding!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
