<p>The whole project have three parts,Client (Winform Client ,run on Windows),Service(want to portal to Linux upon mono),DataBaseServer(PostgreSql ,run on Linux ). and now the problem is Clsa.net can run on Mono ?</p>
<p>I do not need all the featuer of Csla.net ,etc. binding ....;but just the DTO ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone can give help or&nbsp;suggestion?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, December 02, 2010</h2><p>I haven&#39;t tried, but I don&#39;t think so without some work.</p>
<p>Your best bet is probably to use CSLA 4, because the core Csla.dll won&#39;t have much functionality not available in mono.</p>
<p>Unfortunately CSLA 4 probably uses some .NET 4 features that aren&#39;t yet in mono...</p>
<p>In other words, I&#39;m sure it can be done, but you&#39;ll have to do some work.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, December 02, 2010</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Will you find a supported version of Csla on Mono? - No.</p>
<p>But since you are asking specifically about Csla 3.6 you may also look at the Csla 3.6 N2 (for .NET 2.0). This version compiles and runs on .NET 2.0 so it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to make it compile and run on Mono. </p>
<p>You&#39;d have to remove LinqBridge and all classes that reference EnterpriseServcies and ServicedDataPortal (COM based classes), </p>
<p>Having done that I am left with 11 TODO&#39;s according to MoMA (Mono Migration Analyzer) having to do with:<br />* MethodCaller (not implement methods in Reflection and ILGenerator in Mono)<br />* ConfigurationManager.ConnctionStrings </p>
<p>These shouldn&#39;t be too hard to fix and you&#39;d be running on Mono. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kmgbkj replied on Thursday, February 10, 2011</h2><p>Thanks for your reply .</p>
<p>I will try to portal to moon.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, February 10, 2011</h2><p>I have Csla 4.1 compiled for Mono 2.8.2 on OpenSUSE 11.3 and it was quite easy to get up and running.&nbsp; </p>
<p> I&#39;ve tried a couple of the Windows samples but DataBinding was not working correct in Mono. </p>
<p>I hope ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET web apps will work properly but haven&#39;t found time to test properly yet.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 10, 2011</h2><p>I am far less worried about working against the WinForms port to mono than I am with ASP.NET and gtk#.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t imagine a whole lot of Linux devs are eagerly writing WinForms apps for Linux :)&nbsp; I suspect they are more attracted to gtk# because it provides a more Linux-like result.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>kmgbkj replied on Thursday, April 07, 2011</h2><p>Thanks all,your suggestions are useful , I was&#39;t trying port Winform to run on Linux, only port the server&nbsp; side&nbsp; code (WCF or WebService) could run properly, windows server has a big cost,my client did not want to pay more,so I had to find solution.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, April 20, 2011</h2><p>I&#39;d have your client look at one of the Web editions of Windows Server. If your use will fit within its license terms, the cost of the Windows license should be fairly trivial (less than $500 USD).&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/pricing.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/pricing.aspx</a></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
