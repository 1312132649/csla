<p>i would like to know how i would go about marking my child objects as old directly after saving them. in my application i have a &#39;New&#39;, &#39;Preview&#39; and an &#39;Edit&#39; form, the way i would like it to work is that the user can create a new Parent (customer) and add addresses (children) after clicking save i open up the preview form of the objects that were just saved (parent + children) the user then has the option to either click Edit again or close the form. The problem i have is that my children objects are still flagged as IsNew = True, so if the user chooses to click the edit button and save again my child objects are getting re-inserted into the Database as new objects. How can i mark the children objects as old objects after the save?</p>
<p>i have tried &#39;MarckOld(obj); and base.MarkOld(obj) but this does not seem to work. could you please tell me how to accomplish this?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, July 31, 2013</h2><p>Save method returns a new object with correct state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>var o = o.Save()</p>
<p>and it is the new object that you an continue work on.</p>
<p>And when you save the child objects you must also call MarkOld each child.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brendt replied on Wednesday, July 31, 2013</h2><p>thanks JonnyBee...once again top notch advise.
