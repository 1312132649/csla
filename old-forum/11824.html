Versions prior to 4.5.20 would remain covered by the existing proprietary license. Only 4.5.20 and higher would be affected by the license change.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, February 08, 2013</h2><p>The first answer that popped into my mind was, &quot;whatever you want it to be&quot;.</p>
<p>Me, I&#39;ve never had to deal with this situation and have no clue about the differences between them.</p>
<p>As a long-time user of CSLA (in a commercial product), is there a difference between them that materially impacts me? Or are you just looking for suggestions from people who have gone through this sort of deliberation before?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 08, 2013</h2><p>I would value input from anyone who&#39;s gone through this before, but that is rarified air.</p>
<p>I am more interested in any objections people might have from a &quot;user&quot; perspective - like would such a change cause disruption for you, and if so how?</p>
<p>Honestly though, I suspect that (if anything) using a more standard license will reduce any disruption, especially these non-viral licenses that are extremely comparable to my existing license.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, February 08, 2013</h2><p>Just curious but what&#39;s the motivation to change if they&#39;re all pretty much the same? </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 08, 2013</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>Andy<br></b>
<p>Just curious but what&#39;s the motivation to change if they&#39;re all pretty much the same? </p>
<div style="CLEAR:both;"></div>
</div></p>
<p>I&#39;m also looking at moving the CSLA repository somewhere new - to a cloud service - probably either github or codeplex. It is easier to do that if your OSS project is using a standard OSS license.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Saturday, February 09, 2013</h2><p>Those two licenses seem much alike, just some differences</p>
<p>Apache requires to keep a record of &quot;state changes&quot; in each modified &nbsp;file. It has some overhead doing so.<br />Apache requires to include the full text license at all time.<br /><br />Ms PL does not allow any sublicense, meaning that the original license and copyright must be retained.</p>
<p><br />I did not vote because i rather see CSLA be going to be changed to the &quot;BSD 2-Clause License (FreeBSD)&quot; license. Have you considered it?&nbsp;It is more free and it is open as well and it has the most important stated<br /><br /><span><span><i>Software is released without warranty and the software/license owner cannot be charged for damages.</i></span><br /></span><span></span><span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 11, 2013</h2><p>@<strong>rfcdejong </strong>I want a license that requires attribution - keeping copyright notices in the code.</p>
<p>Otherwise the FreeBSD or MIT licenses would be quite attractive because they are as simple as you can get.</p>
<p>Call me selfish or whatever, but after spending ~18 years of my life building up CSLA and providing it to the world (along with a <em>ton</em> of amazing contributions and huge amounts of effort by numerous other contributors), I guess I&#39;m just unwilling to forego attribution on that work.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>nhwilly replied on Wednesday, February 13, 2013</h2><p>Nor should you.</p>

<p>Ah, well that makes sense.&nbsp; I voted for MS-PL; it seems very simple, and I like the idea of moving Csla to CodePlex.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>shawndewet replied on Friday, February 08, 2013</h2><p>The MS-PL says : &quot;<span>If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span>Does that mean that I can only deploy CSLA-based projects in open source projects that I write? What about bespoke software that I develop for clients? Those certainly won&#39;t be open source?</span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 08, 2013</h2><p>@shawdewet, MS-PL is not viral if that&#39;s what you are asking. It basically disallows the use of the software in a GPL project, but not in a commercial project (as long as you keep the copyright notices intact in the CSLA code).</p>
<p>Although I&#39;ve always found copyleft and that stuff to be intellectually curious and somewhat amusing, I have never bought into the social agenda inherent in that licensing model. Nor do I think viral licenses are commercially viable - and you&#39;ll note that most OSS projects that do use viral licenses use it as a &quot;poison pill&quot; technique so you have to buy a commercial license to actually use the product. That is disingenuous imo.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>k4gdw replied on Friday, February 08, 2013</h2><p>I really didn&#39;t notice anything about any of the three choices that would make me hesitate to use them. &nbsp;That said, I&#39;ve always been partial to the Apache license because it actually gives guidance on how to apply the license by including a brief bit of boilerplate in each file to which the license applies. &nbsp;That makes it really easy to specify it as part of the standard file template for your code/text editor of choice.</p>
<p>I&#39;m definitely glad you&#39;re not choosing one of the various GPL licenses. &nbsp;That monstrosity is far to complex.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>chrduf replied on Monday, February 11, 2013</h2><p>We are fine with either one.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
