<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Have you tried this against the test version of CSLA 2.1 ?</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Skafa replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2>I have a feature request,<br><br>Could you add a delegate in DataPortal_Create ? so it will be possible to initialize the object with default values.<br><br>thanks!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rasupit replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2><P>Jaans, next release will target CSLA 2.1.&nbsp; I hope to have it ready when Rocky release the 2.1 version or at least not too long after that.</P>
<P>Skafa, Starting from CSLA 2.0.1, you can initialize your object in Initialize method. Will this work for you?</P>

<P>I'm trying to generate an EditableRoot class using the getProject sproc from the PTracker database.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It seems the @LastChanged timestamp parameter isn't being generated&nbsp;in the AddUpdateParameters method.</P>
<P>Is it just me?&nbsp; Thanks for releasing these!!!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rasupit replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2><P>Current template release does not support "first write wins" concurrency, that's why you @LastChanged is not generated during update.</P>
<P>My exprerience is that most application does not use this.&nbsp; However if many people requested this feature than I don't see a problem adding this on future release.</P>
<P>Ricky</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jaans replied on Sunday, September 10, 2006</h2><P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>For our uses, if a setting on the template to enable "first write wins" optimistic concurrency were available, it would be very advantageous. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I agree with Ricky in that most of the time it's not needed or even over-kill, however most of the applications we deliver have one or two concurrency sensitive areas, and we certainly would benefit from it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>So yes please... but that's just us :-)</FONT></P>

<P>If most people aren't using write first, what are they using?</P>

<P>Thanks</P>

<P>I guess&nbsp;the idea is&nbsp;updates are&nbsp;rare, or the chance of 2 edits happening at the same time is unlikely why worry about it.</P>
<P>Mike</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>gius replied on Tuesday, September 12, 2006</h2>I have a (probably stupid) question - where is the template for stored procedures?

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I might be wrong here, but I seemed to have found a bug with the EditableChild template for C#&nbsp;relating to&nbsp;the Data Accesss methods.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I have specified a parent for the template and resultantly the Insert and Update (internal) methods (with matching ExecuteInsert/ExecuteUpdate methods) accept a second parameter for this parent. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The problem is that the DeleteSelf&nbsp;(and matching ExecuteDelete) methods do not include this parent parameter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>In my understanding the Insert (with a parent specified) may need a Foreign&nbsp;Key (FK) to perform the insert, so conversely the Delete (with a parent specified) may also need a FK to remove the row.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Thanks</FONT></P>

<P>Search for "EditableChild" and "parent" and you'll find number of threads discussing this.&nbsp; Here is one that will answer your question. <A HREF="/forums/thread/5082.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/5082.aspx</A></P>
