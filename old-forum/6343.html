<P>I am&nbsp; using CSLA 3.6 for my business objects, with a winforms client that usesDataBinding.</P>
<P>I am currently have an object hierarchy that has a structure as follows</P>
<P>Rule - (Root business base object)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RuleSetting (Child business base object) (represents a group of settings to be recorded at a point in time)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SettingParameters (child business list base object )</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SettingParameter (Child business base object) </P>
<P>My problem is as follows:</P>
<P>When i change a property&nbsp;on the RuleSetting child object, the rule settings edit level is not changed.</P>
<P>This in turn causes me problems when saving or cancelling. ( Undo Exception ).</P>
<P>I have followed the structure outlined in Project tracker, but to no avail.</P>
<P>Any help or ideas from you csla veterans would be greatfully received</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

It is the BindingSource control that is responsible for invoking the appropriate IEditableObject methods as you interact with the object through binding.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Dexter replied on Friday, February 06, 2009</h2><P>Thanks Rocky</P>
<P>That is&nbsp;what was missing.</P>
<P>When i dragged the parameters child node of the setting it automatically created&nbsp;a BindingSource component for me, but when i drag the setting child node it doesnt.</P>
<P>Like you mention in your 2005 book, every business object must have its own BindingSource control&nbsp;to manage the information of a single object or collection.</P>
<P>Thanks again</P>
