<p>I have an application written with CSLA 3.6.3, the application has about 200 objects.</p>
<p>Do i have to write all the objects again (built the entire application) to upgrade to&nbsp;the latest CSLA stable version or is there any way to do it automatically?</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated, thank in advance,</p>

<p>Getting to 4.1 is harder, because CSLA 4 introduced a new rules engine, and that requires changing business, validation, and authorization rule code. </p>
<p>If your application is being created using code generation, it might be as simple as getting or creating new code gen templates. Otherwise these are code changes, so I don&#39;t know how you&#39;d automate them.</p>
<p>The FAQ has links to other information about versions and upgrading:</p>

<li>Do you have to write all the objects again - NO.</li>
<li>Is there a way to do this automatically - NO.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the resources on the FAQ page: </p>
<p>1. I strongly recommend to use intermediate base classes. This will allow you to add f.ex RegisterProperty extensions that do not use Lambdas.<br />2. As a total you should be prepared to rewrite or change to use standard rules (and there&#39;s a nice rule library available at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=84795&amp;clcid=409">http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com</a>)&nbsp; <br />3. DataAccess code and Object factories should only require a few tweaks. </p>
<p>So - you should be able to keep the property declarations and data access code. Authz/BusinessRules should be rewritten to classes and use the new features -&nbsp; especially async rules is much easier now. </p>
