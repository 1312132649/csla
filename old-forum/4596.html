<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>Is it efficient to create a normalized database.&nbsp; Then create Views for the interaction with the business library.&nbsp; This way I am creating an </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>efficient normalized database, whilst persisting a behavioural object orientated design by the use of views for the creation of the objects, and </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>other stored procedures for the INSERT, UPDATE, and relational cascade rules for the DELETE.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma><STRONG>OR</STRONG>, should I scrap the normalized database design, and go for an object orientated design where each table models the object and foreign keys are </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>used where collaboration exists, and ultimately causing duplicate data.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>It says that we may have two objects, Customer and Invoice where both deal with Customer Data.&nbsp; It says that it is a naive approach for the Invoice to make use of the Customer object, as it should only be used:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>"in the case where the application is adding or editing customer data"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>I agree, BUT what it does not discuss is the possibility that the Invoice object could make use of the CustomerInfo object which is read only, and thus resuing code.&nbsp; Is this going against Encapsulation and if so, should I redfine the fields and properties in the Invoice class itself or create another class called maybe InvoiceCustomerData.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Tahoma>Thanks again,</FONT></P>
