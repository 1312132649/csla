<P>I just tried to purchace the new e-book but it's charging me tax. I don't think that it should be charging tax for Canadian orders.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 07, 2007</h2><P>All I can do is relay what my tax advisor tells me, which is to collect sales tax.</P>
<P>To do this, so as not to inflate the price of the book, I took my end price: US$24.95 and backed the tax into it (and the processing fee from PayPal too).</P>
<P>In other words, you'd pay $24.95 with or without tax - that's the price I wanted to charge as a total fee. Any tax that I end up actually paying comes out of that net amount.</P>
<P>I agree with you, I don't see why I'd have to collect/pay sales tax for non-US (or even non-Minnesota) purchases. I'm researching that myself now to find out for sure.</P>
<P>But regardless, the price is $24.95, and any tax or fees I have to pay out of that is something I'm handling. Perhaps it would be simpler if I turned off the tax processing in the store. That way any tax handling would become invisible to anyone purchasing the book.</P>
<P>(Originally I did the thing as $24.95 with <EM>inclusive</EM> tax, but that caused a lot of confusion. People (including me) aren't used to seeing a price shown with inclusive tax, and it was quite odd and led to a number of confused emails coming my way.)</P>
<P>Hopefully this helps make everything more clear.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, February 07, 2007</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/basicblue/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RangerGuy:</strong></div><div>I just tried to purchace the new e-book but it's charging me tax.

I was just figuring that when I order something online from a store it never mentions tax. I order from mostly larger stores so I guess they have the resources in thier accounting departments to take care of it LOL!</P>
<P>No worries Rocky I thought maybe it was just a bug in the software.. I'm ordering it today :)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
