So no, the data portal is generally not available within DesignTime_Create().</P>
<P>Why you don't hit the breakpoint in the second VS instance is a mystery. It isn't entirely clear how VS is executing the code, and it may be spawning a background process or appdomain to run that code (so it doesn't lock a DLL in a bad way), and that could interfere with attaching a debugger.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, December 01, 2008</h2>Well, I at least found why the designer doesn't hit the code I expect.&nbsp; My CanCreate static method is executing (because the designer execute the New factory method), but because there's no configuration file in the format my configuration reading assembly expects, it throws an exception.<br><br>I've thought about added code to bypass security checks if Csla.DataPortal.IsInDesignMode is true, but that feels like a security risk.&nbsp; Maybe some #if directives can help me, although they feel "dirty."<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
