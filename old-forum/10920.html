<p>One of the weaknesses of the existing system is that the business logic can only be seen in the code.&nbsp; I went through the Sandcastle thing and produced almost a gigabyte of MSDN style documentation that no manager would ever understand.</p>
<p>I hope to use .Net 4,CSLA and Codesmith to&nbsp; help with the module.&nbsp; What can they do to show the business logic in simple sentences?&nbsp; Are there decision tables or should I go with custom xml comments?</p>
<p>Thanks for all ideas</p>
