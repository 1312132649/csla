<p>Having read and reread your ebooks, I still find myself consulting the 2008 book on occasion.&nbsp; The ebooks take a more end-user orientation which I applaud enthusiastically , but sometimes the nuts/bolts is appreciated.&nbsp; I understand that doing both approaches would literally be 2 sets of books,</p>
<p>Do you feel the 2008 book is still (for the most part) a useful reference to the CSLA architecture?&nbsp; Also, are there any glaring &quot;disregard this&quot; pieces of info in the book that come to mind?</p>

<p>But for the most part the 2008 book remains relevant, yes.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
