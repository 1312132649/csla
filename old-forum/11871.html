I have created a ProjectManagementUI by using silverlight. But when i run the application,it gives an error as &quot;<strong>&nbsp;Object type or assembly could not be loaded(ProjectManagement.Library.DesignationList,ProjectManagement.Library, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture= neutral,PublicKeyToken = null)</strong>&nbsp;&quot;. I dont understand that why UI project is giving htis error,while all the tests gives correct output. Please suggest any solution.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, March 07, 2013</h2><p>Your ProjectManagement.Library.Sl is a Silverlight project, not a .NET project right?</p>
<p>And you have made sure that your ProjectManagement.Library and ProjectManagement.Library.Sl project properties both have the same assembly name and root namespace? </p>
<p>And your ProjectManagementUI project references ProjectManagement.Library.Sl?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mayurimalgave replied on Thursday, March 07, 2013</h2><p>Yes,I had already done it..</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mayurimalgave replied on Tuesday, March 12, 2013</h2><p>Hi Rocky...</p>
<p>I solved my problem by re-adding project refferences &amp; assemblies into the each project in the solution...</p>
