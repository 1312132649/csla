The only place in my application where I have had to worry about child objects in the context of data binding is worrying about bindingSources in the UI whenever I update the reference of a parent object, which is something completely different I think.<br><br>Also, since "CSLA is managing the child object value", is there the possibility of implementing a deep-brokenRulesCollection directly in the CSLA base classes? In the UI, whenever the user tries to save an Invalid object, I would love to be able to display all broken rules for the entire object graph.<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Friday, February 29, 2008</h2><P>I do not do the hooking that many other people do but I have seen enough posts where the child object needs to communicate with the parent BO and people are hooking this up. </P>
<P>I have been using a "deep broken rules" collection since the 1.x days. I re-wrote it for 2.x and posted on this forum. Never got much feedback on it though. I am sure it could be improved but it does list out all the broken rules for the root BO and its contained BOs. </P>
<P>Given that Rocky has essentially done the same thing as I did&nbsp;with his management of child BOs, there is absolutely no reason we should not be able to get&nbsp; the deep set of rules. I am not sure if Rocky has written it yet or even plans to write it. </P>
<P>If you find the link to my old code then maybe Rocky can see if it is worth re-using any of the ideas.</P>
