<P>Based on criteria a BO tries to fetch its data from the database. If the criteria are wrong then no data is returned and that brakes the code. </P>
<P>The SqlDataReader has a HasRows public property that solves the problem.</P>
<P>Any suggestions are more than welcome.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>glenntoy replied on Tuesday, July 25, 2006</h2><P>Use the SafeDataReader.Read() &lt;-- returns true if there are records read from the database otherwise false.</P>

That exception flows back to the UI so the UI can tell the user that no data was there.</P>
<P>If you do NOT raise an exception from DataPortal_Fetch(), then you'll have to come up with your own mechanism for notifying the UI that no data was found. Various alternative solutions were discussed in another thread a month or two ago - including the idea of returning a "null object" - not null, but a special empty object of some sort. I didn't pay close attention to the implementation, but you may find info by searching through the forum.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>georgeb replied on Wednesday, July 26, 2006</h2>Thank you for the suggestions. I will follow the idea of "null object". It is best suited in my project for&nbsp;getting a fast answer if an object exists and if exists retrieve the object all with one operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
