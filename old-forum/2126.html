<P>I'm not sure if I should create one&nbsp;contact object&nbsp;with 2 child properties. or 2 objects that inherit from contacts.</P>
<P>I was leaning towards 2 objects that inherit from contacts.</P>
<P>Any guidance would be appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks </P>

<P>What you've described thus far is merely data, which doesn't give enough information to recommend a good approach for an object design. The real question is what are these objects for? What do they do?</P>
<P>To answer those questions you need a use case. Objects don't exist in a vaccuum, nor do they exist at the application level. They exist at the use case level - they exist to fill a specific role within the context of a specific sequence of actions that make up that use case.</P>
<P>Odds are you have a couple use cases: enter/edit vendor and enter/edit client. These two different use cases should have two different sets of objects. Using inheritance to get reuse should only occur to get reuse of <EM>behavior</EM>, not properties (which are really just data). Using inheritance to reuse data/properties merely couples use cases together where they should not be coupled, and the result is typically a hard to maintain system.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mikeclimbs replied on Friday, January 12, 2007</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;It makes sense to treat them as seperate objects.&nbsp; Thinking about the specail validation cases would be difficult to maintain.</P>
