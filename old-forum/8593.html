<p>1. I have a parent object hooked to a csladatasource (which I shall name parentdatasource)&nbsp;and a formview hooked to the parent datasource.</p>
<p>2. I have an object that is a child to the parent hooked to a csla datasource (which I shall name childdatasource) and a formview hooked to the child datasource.&nbsp; </p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I need to be able to hit a button labeled&nbsp;save or insert and have it cause the parent and child to insert their data.&nbsp; I have done this before without CSLA&nbsp;and am now converting this application to CSLA.&nbsp; Before I used to have a button that the user would click and it would run objectdatasource.Insert() for the &quot;parent&quot; data and get the foreign key passed to the child object datasource and then run objectdatasource2.Insert();</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see an insert() method on the csladatasource and when I use the insert button on the formview it inserts the parent just fine but does not trigger the childcsladatasource&#39;s insert.&nbsp; How do I get the child data inserted?&nbsp; I tried nesting the formviews but that did not work either.&nbsp; I&#39;m guessing there is some code that I need to add to the parentdatasource insert but I am new to CSLA and this is my first experience with a child object.&nbsp; I am using CSLAGen to create my objects.</p>
<p>Any help to steer me in the right direction would be much appreciated.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
