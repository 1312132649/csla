<p class="MsoNormal">Hi , <br>
<br>
There is a book "C# &amp; vb.net Conversion pocket reference" by
O'Reilly, which as a long time VB guy, I have found useful for those anoying issues when converting
sample code from one language to the other which would of helped you in this
case. It lists all the equivalents between the languages and then all the
language specific quirks and how to deal with them when converting code. <br>
<br>
You may also like to try one of the various C# / VB.Net language converters
that are on the web for free (just Google it).<br>
<br>
I hope that is of some help to you for any future language issues.<br>
<br>
Regards, <br>
<br>
