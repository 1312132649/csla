However, when utilizing a backing field checking the function always returns false (I do use SetProperty in the property set).  Is this behavior by design?<br /><br />I looked thorugh the latest book but could not find any information regarding this.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 03, 2009</h2><P>Yes, this behavior is by design. The field manager is designed to support managed fields. </P>
<P>The helper methods (GetProperty/SetProperty) have overloads for working with private backing fields, but those overloads don't integrate with the field manager beyond using the PropertyInfo&lt;T&gt; object to avoid requiring the string name of the property.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
