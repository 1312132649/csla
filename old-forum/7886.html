<P>So we did some work with compiler directives, and some with partial classes. I even started a thread on the forum at the time to solicit input from the broader community.</P>
<P>In the end most of the framework code uses compiler directives, because that really does turn out to be the cleaner solution overall (at least in C# where the IDE collapses the part that doesn't apply) for framework code.</P>
<P>However, I still use partial classes in my business library code, because I think it provides cleaner separation, especially for things like sync factory methods, any data access region, etc. Things that have absolutely no meaning on one side of the wire.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
