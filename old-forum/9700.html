<p>I&#39;m looking to start using CSLA in my company. &nbsp;We&#39;re using .NET 4 so it looks like we should be using CSLA 4.</p>
<p>So, far to get up the curve we&#39;ve been reading the 2008 book, but we noticed you have videos and would really prefer to watch those&nbsp;(I&#39;ve watched the free CSLA-MVVM video and think it&#39;s great).</p>
<p>It seems like it makes sense for us to get the $400 bundle for CSLA and CSLA and silverlight, but I noticed that they&#39;re for 3.8 and that you&#39;re due to update them to 4.0 this quater. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my question is, if we buy those now to get started, are the updates included, or would those have to be repurchased when they&#39;re available?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 03, 2010</h2><p>I have no plans for upgrade pricing, So you will need to buy the 4.0 videos separately.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
