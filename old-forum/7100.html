<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>I've been merrily working away at a Silverlight LOB application that uses CSLA Business Objects. What I absolutely have to acknowledge is the sterling work Rocky and his team has done with CSLA Light -&nbsp;well done!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Which brings me to my point... what would be a good way to perform filtering of a databound list on the Silverlight client. I have some CSLA BusinessList / ReadOnlyList data on the client and I'm using the CslaDataProvider control.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>I could go a more manual route that allows me to keep a reference to the original list and use Linq to provide the filtered results from which the CslaDataProvider control could get its data from (or I could re-bind to ui directly).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>To me I'm trying to see if there is an opportunity for doing it in a simpler way, or getting something added to the <STRONG>wish list</STRONG> that will provide a simpler way in future. Something like an event on the CslaProvider control that allows you to hook in you filtering, or something that you can plug-in you filter provider.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Care to share your ideas?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Many thanks<BR>Jaans</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, June 13, 2009</h2><P>The plan is to get a subset of LINQ to CSLA working on the Silverlight platform. That'd allow you to use LINQ queries to do basic sort/filter operations, and get back a&nbsp;LinqBindingList which is a view over the original list.</P>
<P>That's what you'd do today in WPF for example.</P>
<P>There just hasn't been time to get LBL ported over to the SL platform - I'm hopeful that'll come in the relatively near future.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
