<P>For example, we have a numeric up/down control with min and max validation limits set to 0 and 10.&nbsp; When the user increments up, they can continue past 10 endlessly with no feedback that a problem exists.&nbsp; They tab off, mouse away, etc. and the error provider icon displays.&nbsp; Our users would prefer to have the icon appear as soon as the value becomes invalid.</P>
<P>Does anyone have a suggestion how to accomplish this?</P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>If the min and max for validation are 0 and 10, why allow the spinner to go higher or lower?&nbsp; Why not just restrict the control values?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I realize that doesn't really answer your question - I honestly am not sure what to tell you.&nbsp; Since validation happens in the BO when the property values change, about the only option I see is to update the property values directly on your control Change events.&nbsp; That surely defeats almost all of the purpose of data-binding, and - well, I'm sure you've already thought of three or four other bad things about this option.&nbsp; But it probably would work.</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>McManus replied on Tuesday, November 20, 2007</h2><P>My guess is that you use a DataSourceUpdateMode of OnValidation. If you change this to OnPropertyChanged, changed in the Control are immediately propagated to the BO.</P>
<P>You can set this value in the WinForms designer. Select the NumericUpDown control and then open the Advanced DataBindings property editor.</P>
<P>Hope this helps!</P>

<P>tmg4340, fyi...&nbsp; We develop our UI's decoupled from the underlying business logic and min/max limits are components of the business logic.&nbsp; So, the only way to physically limit the control is to expose properties containing these values from the business objects that we can bind the control's properties to.&nbsp; While this is certainly possible, in our current case, the BO has 15 numeric properties and we were (&amp; are) shying away from doing this.</P>
<P>And you're right, we haven't wanted to wire-up a Changed event handler to each control.&nbsp; McManus' solution eliminates that need!</P>
<P>Thanks for the help.</P>
