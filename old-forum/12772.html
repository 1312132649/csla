One of the big things I noticed is the removal of HttpContext.Current and other static properties. It seems like they are going all in on the idea of dependency injection and essentially creating a scope per request. </p>
<p>This seems like a major change when it comes to CSLA contexts and other things. Any thoughts or comments?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
