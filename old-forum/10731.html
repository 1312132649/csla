<p>This is my first post in this forum, so let me start by saying that I consider CSLA a great product, and one of the most important contributions to the .NET developers community. I have always seen in CSLA the framework that Microsoft have never provided in order to build Business applications.</p>
<p>I was very happy when I heard about efforts to support Mono. A week ago I started to try CSLA on Mono, but all my efforts has been unsuccessful. &nbsp;There are some posts about the topic, but I have not been able to find any real steps about how to do it. I have tried many things myself, like compiling the source code with mono, compiling with mono profiles in VS 2010, and others.</p>
<p>Basically, what I want is to create a 3-tier CSLA application using Silverlight 4 as the presentation and hosting the data portal and DAL on linux-apache with mod_mono. I have some asp.net applications already running on my linux server using mono 2.10. So my issue is not related with mono configurations.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the ProjectTracker sample application with the mockDB DAL in order to get my first CSLA application running on mono-linux. It does not matter how I compile and deploy this application I always get the same error:&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Unhandled Exception: System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type &#39;System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute&#39; from assembly &#39;WcfAppServer&#39;. &nbsp;at Mono.CSharp.Driver.Compile () [0x00000] in :0 &nbsp; at Mono.CSharp.Driver.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00000] in :0&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>I have got this error many times before, while deploying applications to Mono, and it&nbsp;usually&nbsp;has been related with compatibility issues, but this time I have not been able to solve it.</p>
<p>If someone have been able to get this working and can provide the steps to follow, versions to use and/or what needs to re-compiled using specific .net frameworks, it will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>First though, make sure you are using the latest Xamarin mono release, and that you are using the latest 4.2 code from the svn repository. The latest public pre-release of 4.2 pre-dates the whole Attachmate/Novell/Xamarin thing.</p>
<p>We have been working on this from the VS10 side of things. I don&#39;t know if we have instructions for building it on Linux for example, but the sln opens and builds in VS10 if you have the latest mono and latest CSLA code.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>reyhc replied on Tuesday, October 04, 2011</h2><p>Thanks for your &nbsp;quick reply.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using already the latest versions of both products. I&#39;m compiling with VS2010 too, but my issues are not while compiling. I can compile perfectly, even in MonoDevelop. The issues are once I deploy the asp.net application to the linux server and I try to run it. So, I may be missing something. That&#39;s why I was asking for more detailed steps to follow.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>In short, any help you (or anyone else) can provide around figuring out the quirks with using mono and/or CSLA in Linux is very much appreciated!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
