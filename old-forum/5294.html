<P>As you might expect, security is paramount for tenants in a multi-tenent environment. Because we are using WinForms, the datacenter configuration might be a bit different than a typical WebForm application. That is, WebForms generally reduce exposure by using a combination of firewalls, reverse proxy servers, and IIS/ASP web pages isolated within a DMZ; with the more vulnerable&nbsp;Business Layer and Data Access more tightly controlled within an inside network.</P>
<P>I am wondering, does something similar to this seem appropriate for the WinForms/CSLA backend... IOW, is there a place for a DMZ that would provide as little attack surface as possible? If so, is there a link to a typical architecture for this type of highly secure deployment?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
