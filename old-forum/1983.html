<P>Just wanted to know if we are getting the ebook for the 2.1 version for XMas or after :) ?</P>
<P>You mentioned you had nearly finished. And would that be the VB or C# version</P>

(<A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLANET21EbookProgressReport.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLANET21EbookProgressReport.aspx</A>)</P>
<P>In this case I'm doing the VB version first, then swapping in the C# code to create the C# version. For those who watch these things, it is my intent to alternate. So the last book was C# first, swapping in the VB code - this one is the other way around. I figure this alternating approach will help keep me honest:&nbsp;supporting both languages equally.</P>
<P>Depending on how long it takes to swap in the C# code and get that reviewed for mistakes, the C# version will likely be a couple weeks after the VB one. Since I'm directly publishing this via the web, there's not&nbsp;that lengthy delay for the printer/distributor cycle like with the previous book, so the two versions will come out much closer to each other time-wise.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Tuesday, December 19, 2006</h2><P>Not just out of curiosity, but how do the two versions compare in sales?</P>
<P>Amazon shows the VB version to be #102,603 in sales, with the C# version being #8,266 (a quite respectable number for an advanced&nbsp;technical architecture book, by the way!)</P>
<P>Switching back and forth is very egalitarian, but not necessarily in the best interest of the majority of your customers.&nbsp; (Then again, I c#ould be biased.)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
