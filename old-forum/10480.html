<p>Obviously, the runtime fails to convert the value &#39;John&#39; to a decimal, hence the error.</p>
<p>In the past I&#39;ve handled this by making all my exposed properties of type string.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;d then write a low-priority rule that would check to make sure the string value could be converted to the required type.&nbsp; If that worked all subsequent rules would cast the string as required for rule checking and I&#39;d be clear to insert the value (upon cast) into the database.</p>
<p>Is there a better approach?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Wednesday, June 29, 2011</h2><p>You mean like a textbox within a datagrid template column?</p>
<p>I&#39;d use a numeric editor to stop the user from entering a non-decimal in the first place.&nbsp; We ended up writing our own numeric control based on a googled one we saw that we liked the behavior of, which supports currency or non-currency and a &quot;currency culture&quot; property (i.e. fr-FR, en-US, etc).</p>
<p>(Sorry, can&#39;t share it, but it didn&#39;t take much more than a day worth of work and it&#39;s much better feedback to the user than allowing then to enter &quot;John&quot; for a salary amount for example).</p>
<p>(BTW you didn&#39;t mention UI but this was for SL that we did this)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
