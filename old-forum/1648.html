We have some multipage forms that would have to save to multiple child tables with complex validation. What better than a csla bizobj?&nbsp; Though our MIS group thinks csla is too complicated, too open source (who's going to give support, etc) it would be nice to put together a demo.&nbsp; <br><br>Bob Hagan<br></font></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
