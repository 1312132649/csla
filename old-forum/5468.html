<div><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, I am still using 3.0.4 with no plans at 
this time to move to the latest version. Am I correct in understanding that the 
latest version of the framework allows you to "walk" up the parent-child 
hierarchy to get to the root?</font></div>

<div><font size="2" face="Verdana">Root (BB)<br>&nbsp; -&gt; Child Col (BLB)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; 
Child (BB)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>So Child could know who it's parent (root) is without 
having to add any additional code to your collections?</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2" face="Verdana">If this is the case, has anyone transplanted the 
code from the latest framework to any older version? If so, were there any 
issues?</font></div>
