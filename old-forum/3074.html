<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I build a generic Contact Object with all the basic data for a person.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then inherit from that to build a employee object,&nbsp;relative object and Next of Kin object?</P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>malloc1024 replied on Friday, June 22, 2007</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Inheritance
should be based on behavior not data.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Properties are data not behavior.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If your object shares behavior, inheritance can be considered.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, keep in mind that you should favor composition
over inheritance.</span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeHaynes replied on Friday, June 22, 2007</h2><P>Thanks for the response.</P>
<P>I had soon come to a similiar conclusion after writing that but I left it just in case someone had a different experience.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
