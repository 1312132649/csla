<p>Thank you in advance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 09, 2010</h2><p>There are two parts to my answer.</p>
<p>First, yes you can do this. To do this, use an async rule and a command.</p>
<p>Second, remember that any rule of the type you describe is just your best guess at the time. You never <i>really know</i> if the rule will be violated until the user clicks save. This is because some other user might be doing the same exact thing, and might click save after you&#39;ve check the value, but before your user has clicked save. So you still need to handle the case that failure occurs when the user clicks save.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
