The silverlight version has .Client files.  But the examples I have seen for WPF don't have this requirement it would seem.  <br /><br />Is there a missing link?  Have I setup the WPF client correctly?<br /><br />Kind Regards,<br /><br />Nick</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 01, 2010</h2><P>This is how .NET works.</P>
<P>Each .NET AppDomain has its own config file.</P>
<P>In the case of an ASP.NET app, this is a web.config file. In the case of an EXE (like a WPF app) it is &lt;programname&gt;.exe.config (which is what VS renames your app.config to when you build). And as you note, Silverlight has its own naming convention.</P>
<P>The point being, your WPF app is running on a separate machine, and thus clearly in a separate AppDomain, from the WCF server. So it absolutely needs its own config file.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
