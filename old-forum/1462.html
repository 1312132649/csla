<P>each table has a set of items that are always persent:</P>
<P>ID,Active,CreationTimestamp,WhoCreated,LastChnaged,WhoChanged</P>
<P>CreationTimestamp is datetime, WhoCreated is an int that is set one time</P>
<P>LastChnaged is datetime of the last update, WhoChnaged is an int id of the user who made the chnages.</P>
<P>now I want to on a read/edit form to show the name of the person who created the record and the name of the person who made the last update.</P>
<P>so I am debating on:</P>
<P>read from db and edit the BO to make the strings RO and not send them out for updates</P>
<P>or</P>
<P>make a global list of ID,name and bind a control to show the name</P>
<P>or </P>
<P>make a namevalue list and have many instancaes as needed with the same list in memory a bunch of times.</P>
<P>or ???? ideas ????</P>
<P>the global list has some points in that it might keep from a lot of db access and the list will not chnage very often.</P>
<P>but then do I bind it on the form or use a ro property in th BO or???</P>
<P>just wondered if others have the same kind of thing and how they deal with it.</P>

<P>I know the "Last Changed" is not a history... I keep that in an aduit table when needed.</P>
<P>I guess I could go with a join on select, then I'd need to tweak my Upddate and Insert procs to ignore the names and use the ID ...</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
