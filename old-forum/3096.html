We are running into a problem creating Private Accessors. Microsoft redid how they work under the hood in this new version of Visual Studio. So, what we are running into is we tell Orcas to create a private accessor for our CSLA Business Objects.</P>
<P>When we try to compile our test project we get this compile error:</P>
<P>Error&nbsp;1&nbsp;System.Collections.Generic.IList`1[Csla.NameValueListBase`2+NameValuePair[K,V]] is not a GenericTypeDefinition. MakeGenericType may only be called on a type for which Type.IsGenericTypeDefinition is true.&nbsp;Infrastructure.Utility.Test<BR></P>
<P>So there must be something wrong with how things are being generated with Orcas. My question is does anyone have an idea of how to fix this? </P>
