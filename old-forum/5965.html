<P>I just wanted to make sure that the same holds true when the criteria that defined the contents of the list also changes that the items will add/remove from the LinqBindingList.</P>
<P>For exampe if I create a LinqBindingList based on all Items where a FK = 1234 and a IsValid Flag is False.&nbsp; If I databind to that LinqBindingList and modify data such that the IsValid flag resolves to True, will that item drop out of the LinqBindingList and my databound control?</P>
<P>Ditto on the reverse - if I programatically modify some values in my originalBusinessBaseList such that IsValid = False those items will suddenly be added to the LinqBindingList?</P>
<P>I got the impression that this holds true.&nbsp; If not, is there a 'rebuild' method I need to invoke on the PropertyChanged event?</P>
<P>Has anybody had any issues with this?&nbsp; It sounds too good to be true but I'm wondering if the Databinding and everything will play nicely.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
