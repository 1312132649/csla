If you’ve already purchased the series, you can download the new video from the <A href="http://download.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?t=Core38"><STRONG>download page</STRONG></A>.</P>
<P>Video 4 covers the data portal and how you can use it for 1-, 2- and 3-tier deployments of your applications. This is 1:53 hours of in-depth content, providing an overview of the data portal concept, and an extensive walk-through of code using the data portal. You’ll see how to configure the client, set up and configure a server&nbsp;– all using WCF. Even better, you’ll see various object patterns that leverage the data portal, including the powerful unit of work pattern.</P>
<P>The special pre-release pricing is still in effect for this amazing video series. Buy before the end of the year and get 33% off the regular $300 price. That’s right&nbsp;– <A href="http://store.lhotka.net/"><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>buy now</FONT></STRONG></A> for just $200.</P>
<P>And while you are at the store, take a look at the CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series, which is 15% off until the end of 2009. If you are using CSLA&nbsp;.NET to build Silverlight applications, this video series will get you up and running&nbsp;– from creating your first Silverlight project in Visual Studio 2008, through implementing the UI, the business objects and data access, everything you need to know is in this one series of videos.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Thursday, December 17, 2009</h2>Hi Rocky,
<br>
<br>
Quick question, I am currently in the process of watching the Silver Light videos. I am taking my time so I am moving very slow and I am still at video number 3.
<br>
<br>Given the fact that I will not be doing any Silver Light development any time soon, should I temporarily drop the Silver Light videos and focus on the Core CSLA .Net 3.8 videos? I would assume that the Core CSLA .Net 3.8 videos would be very valuable for Silver Light development too so I think it may be a good move for me right now.
<br><br>What would you recommend me doing?
<br><br>Thanks.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, December 17, 2009</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If you are not currently doing Silverlight development, then the
Core videos are probably more immediately useful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The Core videos go into more depth on each topic covered,
because there&#8217;s no focus on the UI, so all my time is spent covering object
design, implementation, data access implementation, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

They are worth every penny and more.<br /><br />Here is what you do.  Get a large cup of coffee (or a jug if you must), start the video, lean back in your chair, and let Rocky do all the work.  Learning Csla was never this easy.  I ought to know, I have been a student and a user since Csla 1.0<br /><br />Javed</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 18, 2009</h2><P>Hopefully I'll remember everything perfectly after one viewing though.&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
<P>Seriously though... do you need to see the videos, or is it enough to listen?&nbsp; I did download the Zune videos, so I'm wondering if I can learn while working out.</P>
<P>Off topic, it's too bad the Zune doesn't get the love it should.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Friday, December 18, 2009</h2>1. I have had to watch the videos again and again to get a good enough understanding.<br /><br />2. Audio is nowhere near enough, at least for me.  More than 75% of each video is code.  While you can open the demo, correlating it with what you are hearing would be cumbersome. It is a lot easier to just watch the video.<br /><br />3. OT: I don't know - may be it's the looks, may it's the name, may be it's the Zune's sense of humor - that's always big, I'm told. Who knows! </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
