That is the final draft that went to editing, so all the content is there (just not edited, so watch out for typos :) ).</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a final code download for the 0.4 release.</p>
<p>I post in several places when I update the ebooks:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the link to the notification that the <em>Data Portal Configuration</em> final draft went online: <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/10343.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/10343.aspx</a></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 17, 2011</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>hramos360<br></b>
<p>I realize that the documentation and samples are still being worked on , but they should not have available for sale until critical pieces were completed.&nbsp; </div></p>
<p>I knew this was a risk by the way, but I thought (and think) the value of providing early partial content outweighs the confusion some people have when they see that parts of the work-in-progress ebooks aren&#39;t there.</p>
<p>People who purchase the <em>ebook series</em> get a bonus (at least most people see it as a bonus), in that I put pre-release versions of each ebook online <em>as I write it</em>. So for several weeks this means people get &quot;early access&quot; to the content, literally as I&#39;m writing it.</p>
<p>If that is confusing, please avoid downloading any of the ebooks until the label &quot;draft&quot; is applied. Don&#39;t download any thing with the &quot;pre-release&quot; label.</p>
<p>I point this out, because later this week a partial pre-release of the <em>ASP.NET MVC</em> ebook will go online. I expect I&#39;ll be about 50% done at that point, so a lot of the content won&#39;t be there. But some good content <em>will</em> be there, and many people will (hopefully) find it useful.</p>
