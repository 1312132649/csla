<P>I've read through all the forum messages about using NHibernate with CSLA and it looks as though David Dilworth was planning to&nbsp;set up a version of PTracker which used NHibernate for persistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there such a thing available at all?&nbsp; </P>
<P>I've had a look on CSLAContrib but nothing there and I'm not sure&nbsp;if David is still&nbsp;active in this space.&nbsp; A reference implementation would be really helpful if there's one around...</P>
<P>Cheers</P>

<P>Yes I am still around - mainly as a reader at the moment, rather than as a contributor.</P>
<P>You know the story though - changing project requirements, project deadlines to meet and all that...</P>
<P>Anyway, that's why we haven't been able to get an NHibernate version of the ProjectTracker example up - we've been too busy doing project work instead.</P>
<P>However, we are still using a combination of CSLA and NHibernate&nbsp;and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</P>
<P>I still believe that we can (one day) re-work the Project Tracker example in an NHibernate style - it's just not going to be today !</P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Hey, wow, that&#8217;s great news!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for
that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I&#8217;ve been working on few things myself &#8211;
particularly around the testability of CSLA business objects.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve abstracted
out all the persistence and using Windsor for IoC so I can inject the persistence
mechanism (Mock, ADO.NET, Nhibernate, etc) at runtime.&nbsp; Works really
nicely &#8211; you can run unit tests against business objects which don&#8217;t
have to hit the db layer so you can test property setters/getters/biz logic without
the distraction and performance overhead of actual db connections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Anyway, excellent news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
