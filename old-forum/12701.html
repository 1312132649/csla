Is this the only way to add broken rules?&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Saturday, July 19, 2014</h2><p>Yes, things have changed a lot since version 1. </p>
<p>In version 4 you must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>IPropertyInfo for the properties </li>
<li>And register business rules </li>
<li>And there is only Type registration rules (no instance rules)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create lambda rules that is simple to look at. See this post from Jaans: <br /><a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/12652/57435.aspx#57435">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/12652/57435.aspx#57435</a> </p>
<p>And you may also use most of your csla 3.6 or newer validation rules by using the Csla.Validation package.<br /><a href="http://jonnybekkum.wordpress.com/2013/10/07/csla-validationthe-new-nuget-package-in-csla-net-4-5-40/">http://jonnybekkum.wordpress.com/2013/10/07/csla-validationthe-new-nuget-package-in-csla-net-4-5-40/</a></p>
<p>Csla does NOT provide and means of interacting directly with the BrokenRulesCollection. Each rule provide a RuleResult list and the rule engine has the responsibility of updating the BrokenRulesCollection.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, July 22, 2014</h2><p>Yes, assuming we are talking about CSLA version 4.x.</p>
<p>You must crate a rule class that has a Execute method and the rule engine will make sure to update the BrokenRules collection.<br />CSLA does NOT provide any methods to allow you to update the BrokenRules list. It must only be updated by the RuleEngine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A special version of rules is the Lambda rule and search the forum for QuickRule to see some samples and code on a Fluent like Lambda rule from Jaans.&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
