There are also limitations to just how much punishment Rocky can take, too. (At least, I think so.)</P>
<P>A thought crossed my mind that perhaps you might consider doing two books, probably slightly larger than the single book when put together. </P>
<P>Book 1 would be a thorough walkthrough of the framework. Obviously you're finding limitations to just how much you can embelish and explain within the confines of a set # of pages for this portion. This might allow for a full and complete description of the framework.&nbsp;(Chaps 1-5) </P>
<P>Book 2 would be the application/usage of the framework. (Chaps 6 on). -- Having a separate book might allow for you to not worry about cutting out such vital things as WinForms/WebForms, etc and allow the covering of things that <EM>are</EM> important but might be subject to removal for space reasons. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expert C# 2008 Business Object Applications</P>
<P>Just a thought -- probably a highly impractical thought but a thought nonetheless. </P>
