<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>1. What is the purpose of the classes found in the C5 folder of CSLA? Would I be using them? Should I be concerned about all the warnings I'm getting?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>2. Using CSLA 3.0.5 for Windows Forms development, I've created abstract base subclasses of the 6 major CSLA base classes, i.e. BusinessBase, BusinessListBase, etc. , as XYZBusinessBase, etc. I build my business classes on these XYZ base classes. Should I continue with this principle in CSLA 3.6.0, or is there better/alternative suggestions?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Thanks</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, January 12, 2010</h2>Hi, <br><br>1. C5 is an external library that is used for indexing (and Linq support) in CSLA 3.5 to 3.8. It will be removed from CSLA 4 and I would not be concerned with warnings from C5. And you would normally not need to use this library in your code. <br><br>2. I recommend that you create your own intermediate classes as a best practice. This allows you to add common custom behaviour to your BOs. <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
