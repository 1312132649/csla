<p>This is what I put in the post-build even on the project to get to work locally,&nbsp;but I have to take it out since it obviously doesn&#39;t work on a remote build on a TFS box: </p>
<p>copy /Y &quot;$(TargetDir)$(ProjectName).dll&quot; &quot;$(SolutionDir)Nca.Web\bin\$(ProjectName).dll&quot;</p>
<p>Does anyone have the changes needed to the msbuild script to get these ouputted durring an automated build as well as a local Visual Studio build?</p>
