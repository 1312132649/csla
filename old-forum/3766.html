<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>I have&nbsp;a issue with adding paging support to child collection. All lists are paging supported, it worked well with readonly list e.g. search result. We only have problem with updatable lists e.g. Whenever a new&nbsp;item is created, it may or may not appear in current list depends on&nbsp;what filter criteria are. Although it can appear immediately in current list, it will be disappeared when user turns to other page due to we do paging in database with actual records but newly added record only stored in memory.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>Do you have any suggestion?</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>Thanks,</SPAN></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, October 24, 2007</h2><P>I would expect that you'd save any changes to the current page of items before moving to another page? Or are you storing the information in Session somehow?</P>
<P>If you are storing the information in Session you should probably be doing some sort of merge operation, merging each page's information into the master list. In that case, your factory method can try to serve up each page from memory, and only go to the data portal if the entire page isn't in memory.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
