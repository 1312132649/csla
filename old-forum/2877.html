<P>I'm using CodeSmith 4.0 and the CSLA template to build ReadOnly classes.</P>
<P>The problem is this Code Smith 4.0 generated code:</P><FONT size=2>
<P></FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>Using</FONT><FONT size=2> cn </FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>As</FONT><FONT size=2> SqlConnection = </FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>New</FONT><FONT size=2> SqlConnection(<STRONG><U>Database</U></STRONG>.VELIVEconnection)</FONT></P>
<P>Indicated by the error: Name 'Database' is not declared</P>
<P>How do I fix this in my classes? I really want the connection string to come from settings(I think).</P>
<P>I'm new to VB and the CSLA. I've read Expert&nbsp;VB 2005 Business Objects and love the concepts. But my understanding of VB and CSLA is like swiss cheese. I have huge holes everywhere.</P>
<P>The above error is the only one I have in my library class but of course many times in each class.</P>
<P>Any help to understand this issue is sincerely appreciated.</P>

<P>I guess that you are expected to write the Database class by hand, and that that class should be public and static, and that it should have a public static property in it that returns the correct connection string, with a name of VELIVEconnection.</P>
<P>I'm also guessing that somewhere in the generation process&nbsp;you supplied the value "VELIVEconnection" (or it defaulted to it and you didn't notice :), and that you would be expected to supply additional properties for each database connection you intend to use.</P>
<P>Let us know if that's it!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Tuesday, May 15, 2007</h2><P>forgot to add, there is a whole csla forum devoted to the templates.</P>
<P>you need to go to the forum home and work your way down from there.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
