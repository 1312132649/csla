If I use a converter in the binding (bool to visibility converter), then when I&nbsp;set the value of the&nbsp;visible property from the&nbsp;viewmodel the UI does not receive the propertychanged event. In fact, it appears as though the event isn&#39;t attached to anything. When I remove the converter and instead do the conversion in the viewmodel it works fine. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a better solution?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
