I was wondering if anyone else has managed to solve the problem of storing custom user data such as form display properties, in conjunction with remote deployment?<br><br>More specifically, if you try to use the Form.Settings object in your Windows application the Framework will attempt to store your settings back in your config, which isn't persisted locally when using remote deployment, and it raises an error and causes the app to crash.<br><br>From what I understand, from reading other posts of a similar nature, you have to set a local path to the config using the AppDomain.CurrentDomain object. I would assume that NetRun would be required to store the config at this location prior to setting the path, and I would also assume that this would raise all sorts of other issues regarding validity and maintenance of this file. e.g. how would you retain custom settings whilst still deploying important application configuration detail.<br><br>Does anybody have any ideas?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, March 25, 2008</h2>Perhaps the safest solution is to use Isolated Storage. That's generally future-proof (it continues to exist through today, even in Silverlight - perhaps <EM>especially</EM> in Silverlight) and works even in low trust scenarios.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
