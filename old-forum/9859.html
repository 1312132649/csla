<p>I&#39;m sorry before if there is the same topic about this questions.</p>
<p>1. Is there a SIGNIFICANT Difference of Business Object 2008 book and CSLA 3.8 Video Series Content ?</p>
<p>2. I want to know about CSLA MVVM . And I have read on Roc Blog at &quot;Usage CSLA 4 series outline&quot;, and i saw that in this book included MVVM material. Is there a significant difference with CSLA 4 MVVM Video series ? For my personal reason , I&#39;m more like to read form book than hear from video [ Because my english is not to good, so reading a book is easier for me than hear from video ]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for anyone who want to give me an suggestion or anything</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The <em>Core 3.8</em> video series was created for CSLA .NET 3.8. The two are very comparable, but obviously the videos cover the newer code and framework features.</p>
<p>The <em>Using CSLA 4: Silverlight 4 and WPF</em> ebook will cover MVVM, just like the <em>CSLA 4 MVVM</em> video series does.

The most likely price range is US $20-25, but that is not a guarantee.</p>
<p>Right now I plan to finish the <em>Creating Business Objects</em> ebook by the end of 2010. My aggressive plan is to write one book every 2-3 weeks in January-March, which probably means the Silverlight/WPF book will be around the end of February.</p>

<p>Hi Roc Thanks a lot for your quick respond.</p>
<p>I have go in your online store, i saw that the price of CSLA 4 Ebook series is $99.95, is it permanent price ?</p>
<p>And if you haven&#39;t finished this ebook series, if I buy it, i will get the book progressively ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buying the series gets you each ebook as it comes out, so yes it is progressive. As I put each PDF or zip file online the files are instantly available to series purchasers.</p>
<p>For the <em>Creating Business Objects</em> book I&#39;m doing an experiment, which is to make the ebook available <em>while I am writing it</em> to series owners. Right now the first 30-40% of the book is already online in &quot;pre-draft&quot; form - literally I just take what I&#39;ve got done at the end of each week and put it up there for download.</p>
<p>This seems to be working well, and I suspect I&#39;ll do the same thing for the remaining ebooks - which is an added bonus for series owners since they get at least some of the content weeks ahead of when each ebook can be purchased individually.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>OscarLauroba replied on Tuesday, January 18, 2011</h2><p>Hello Rocky:</p>
<p>I&#39;m a visual basic developer and know the vb version of csla was deprecated few years ago :-( , but... Are the samples of your ebook series written both in C# and VB or only in C#? Will you release different books for each language like Expert VB 2008 Busniness Object?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Oscar.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, January 18, 2011</h2><p>I don&#39;t plan to duplicate the books themselves. I do plan to use Instant VB to convert the samples to VB once the book is complete and stable.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
