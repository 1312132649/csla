<P>Please forgive my ignorance on this subject, but recently I was asked why factory methods are used in the CSLA business objects instead of just overloading constructors.&nbsp; I searched through the book and found a couple reasons.&nbsp; One is to not expose the constructor directly.&nbsp; The other is to give the opportunity to check authorization of the action being called.</P>
<P>Am I off on these two?&nbsp; Can anyone give me&nbsp;explanations as&nbsp;to why&nbsp;these are important or offer other reasons?&nbsp; I person that asked me this question said that the authorization can be done within the constructor as well.&nbsp; I don't know enough about OOP or CSLA to offer intelligent arguments for these, so any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you!</P>

<P>HTH</P>

<P>In general, does using factory methods increase the complexity of the class?&nbsp; In my opinion, it makes writing the UIs easier and if the factory methods are always used, obviously there's consistency across the classes.</P>
<P>Are there any arguments AGAINST using factory methods?&nbsp; Thanks again.</P>
