<P>Are there any real performance differences in using one or the other?</P>
<P>I created a EDM in the DalLinq project assembly and tried to use the same implemenation that is being used in the ProjectTracker.Library using the Csla.Data.DataContext and I got an error telling me that I couldn't use it for SqlEntityClient??</P>
<P>Does the framework support Linq to Entities?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>I haven't incorporated an EntityContextManager into Csla.Data yet because EF isn't released. The EF data context object isn't&nbsp;the same as the L2S data context, so a different manager class will be required.</P>
<P>If you want to use EF now you can copy the ContextManager class and modify it to work with an EF context instead - and when EF is released I'll put something along that line into CSLA.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ktran replied on Monday, May 19, 2008</h2><P>Great, thanks&nbsp;for the input and insight on that, I'll keep inline with Linq to Sql and using the ContextManger in CSLA for now.</P>
