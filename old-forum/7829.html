Also, you could implement compression.  In SL this is trivial, in .NET clients it takes a bit more effort.  Also, you need to increase reader quotas in the config file.  Something like this:<br /><br />        <br />            <br />                						maxReceivedMessageSize="2147483647"<br />						receiveTimeout="00:30:00"<br />						sendTimeout="00:30:00"<br />						openTimeout="00:10:00"<br />						closeTimeout="00:5:00"><br />                    						maxBytesPerRead="2147483647"<br />						maxArrayLength="2147483647"<br />						maxStringContentLength="2147483647"<br />                        maxDepth="1024"/><br />                <br />            <br />.....<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: tjpatel403 [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Tuesday, October 20, 2009 3:56 PM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: [CSLA .NET] "Maximum request length exceeded" on Dataportal.Update() WCF call<br /><br />I have a list object with about 600 items in it...each item has about 5 properties.
