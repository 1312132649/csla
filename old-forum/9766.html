<p>Is there anyone out there that has something like Lightswitch but targeting CSLA?&nbsp; I don&#39;t just mean generating the business classes but the UI, the ViewModel, the Services (to support Silverlight), etc.?</p>
<p>My company is going to be jumping into .NET enterprise development in&nbsp;a big way and I would like to use CSLA but I also need something like LightSwitch to get the development jump-started so we can start showing users the future and also give the developers something that doesn&#39;t have to be scrapped when they need to do customized enterprise business logic.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to get some feedback on this from everyone.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
