<p>The specifics is that a user should be able to connect to an application server using different channels.</p>
<p>E.g. Company A runs its own application server using direct to SQL server connection, Company B runs its own application server using web service portal, Accountant C needs to access the servers of both of the companies using client program .</p>
<p>The problem is that CSLA choses dataportal by the application config file, which is readonly for non admin user (as any other file in Program Files).</p>
<p>Is there any way around to dynamically switch between dataportals/servers for a limited user?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
