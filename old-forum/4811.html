<P>I would like to know What I have to set up to receive exception messages in spanish language from CSLA framework. I see that the sample project (Project Tracker) throws exception messages in spanish, but when I use the framework in my application, I receive the messages in English. I've added the CSLA.dll to my project but I don't know if I have to add another dll.</P>
<P>I appreciate your help...</P>

You should at least have a folder named <i><b>es</b> </i>and <i><b>es-ES</b></i> with the spanish messages in the file Csla.resources.dll. <br><br>English is the default language and if a language resource is missing all the messages will be shown in English. <br><br>/jonny<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 07, 2008</h2><P>Also, .NET selects the language resource file based on the UI culture value for your thread. This defaults to the culture setting for your machine, but can be changed.</P>
<P>So your machine's culture would need to be es or es-ES so the thread defaults to that value - or you need to set the thread's UI culture explicitly to the value you want.</P>
<P>Then .NET should automatically use the appropriate resource file from the folder with that culture's name.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>juancho559 replied on Wednesday, May 14, 2008</h2><P>Hi, I appreciate your help</P>
