I've used Csla on an internal webhost, and am now considering bidding a project which would require running it on a third party web host.  Are there issues or gotcha's I should be aware of?

Thanks,

I tried a simple app at discountasp.net, because they said they support this, and it worked. I haven't deployed a full-blown app there though.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>WyattRidesAgain replied on Saturday, February 17, 2007</h2>Michael,
