I was using it to demo some of the MVC functionality.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ezTechDirect replied on Tuesday, May 11, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;ve been waiting a long time for an opportunity to implement the CSLA framework into an application and the opportunity has come knocking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I primaily work in VB.Net I&#39;ll have a lot of C# conversion work to do without a VB.net sample app to work off of.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any chance that the VB version will be upgraded to at least compile even if it doesn&#39;t take advantage of all the latest features?&nbsp; The application I will be working on is more of a suite consisting of a windows client data entry system, web access, reporting service, data processing services, etc.&nbsp; I could use the current version of the framework but with a project plan spanning the next 12-18 months I would rather implement the newest version right off the bat as I have plenty of time for the bugs to be worked out.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 11, 2010</h2><p>Yes, the VB samples will get updated as well. Not the VB framework though, just the samples.</p>
<p>The VB framework project was a community effort, and Sean Rhone (in particular) put in an amazing amount of work to build the VB 3.7 version. But in my mind that was a bridge effort, to give people relying on the VB framework time to come up with a strategy to move to the core framework. And of course it was a powerful learnng tool that went along with the <em>Expert VB 2008 Business Objects</em> book. With CSLA 4 I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any plan to carry the VB framework code forward.</p>
<p>But I absolutely intend to carry the primary VB samples forward. Perhaps not all of them will exist in both languages, as there are numerous conceptual samples that I&#39;m not sure are worth porting. But ProjectTracker is one that will exist in both languages.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
