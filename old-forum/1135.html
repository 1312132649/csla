<br>
I would like that my objects have a new event: ObjectChanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This event will be launched when any property of my object, or one of
its children, or one of its grandChild are modified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
There is the event propertyChanged, but he is launched when one of the
properties is modified (what normal), but not if a child is
modified.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
My problem arises when my object has grandchild, and I don't know how
to go up information to announce that a grandchild is modified.<br>
<br>
Have an idea?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Thank you <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Wednesday, September 06, 2006</h2>Just attach an event handler to each of your child changed events (ListChanged, PropertyChanged, etc.) and call OnPropertyChanged(string.Empty).<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoOfMetL replied on Wednesday, September 06, 2006</h2><br>
I wanted to use the OnPropertyChanged event, but I don't want reload all my objet.<br>
<br>
If a property of a grandChild is modified, I do not want that the data
of my EditableRoot is reloaded. For a single object, it is not
inevitably annoying, but for a collection, that creates a problem. So I
wanted to avoid using the OnPropertyChanged event <br>
<br>
What do you think about it? <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Wednesday, September 06, 2006</h2>My personal opinion is that it is better to work within the .NET framework when possible and practical.&nbsp; Using PropertyChanged will make changes work with data binding which will be useful if you ever have a root object rule property that recalculates based on changes in its children.<br><br>What problem are you experiencing with collections?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoOfMetL replied on Wednesday, September 06, 2006</h2><br>
I was afraid that if a collection were displayed with each time a
property of a grandChild was modified, the screen is continuously
updated is thus worse performances. <br>
<br>
I will test like that to see the result. <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Wednesday, September 06, 2006</h2>The only time this seems to be a problem is with list controls displaying large collection.&nbsp; But in that case the list control is going to be responding to the collection's change events anyway.&nbsp; There are cases where you need to turn off that event/handler cycle when doing lots of updates to&nbsp;a displayed&nbsp;collection in code, but the effect on the controls displaying the parent object is usually fairly trivial.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoOfMetL replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2>I implement the solution : <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attach an event handler to each of child changed events
(ListChanged, PropertyChanged, etc.) and call
OnPropertyChanged(string.Empty).<br>
<br>
And it's works.<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>
