<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>What you wrote makes sense, <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>I figured I might have to do some type of abstraction web service layer over my CSLA BO’s to make those Java guys happy, was just hoping there might be an easier way.<o:p></o:p></FONT></P>

<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If you follow the techniques in chapter 11, it is entirely up to
you (and either asmx or WCF) as to whether your service can be consumed by
other technologies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If Adobe&#8217;s technology works with standard WSDL, then it
should work with asmx web services, or WCF with basicHttpBinding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>But none of that has anything at all to do with CSLA &#8211;
that is purely a matter of the service interface you implement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
