<P>I&nbsp;noticed that there is a AddRule method but there is no RemoveRule method in validation rules, pls correct me if I'm wrong. </P>
<P>This can be useful in this situation.</P>

<P>In other words, what you are saying is that you have three rules that are "compound" rules: rules that have conditions dependent on multiple object properties. This is a rule implementation issue, not a reason to add/remove rules.</P>
<P>CSLA does a bunch of caching on rules after they've been added. If you read through the 2.1 Handbook, you'll see all the work that occurs early on to support short-circuting, per-type/per-instance rules, priorities and so forth.</P>
<P>If I open the door to add/remove over the life of the object, I'd need to trigger this processing each time. While I could do that, the performance impact would not be pretty...</P>
<P>You are far better off making your rule methods smarter.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
