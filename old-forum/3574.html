<P>I have been working on an open source&nbsp;code generator called <A href="http://www.codeplex.com/nbusiness">NBusiness</A> for some time now and I am interested in providing some CSLA templates with the generator. The project is&nbsp;essentially just a template driven code generator for business objects, though it has a slight different way of accomplishing this goal than most other code generators out there. Currently NBusiness comes with a light-weight business object framework to get things going (and it's medium trust) but it isn't nearly as robust and feature packed as CSLA. It would be great to provide templates for both.</P>
<P>Basically what I'm hoping&nbsp;for is someone here to create some CSLA templates for this project! It could be a good opportunity to do some work on an open source application which is rewarding in multiple ways. Also there's a variety of interesting technologies you will need to become familar with to get going, such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Visual Studio Integration Packages</LI>
<LI>CodeDom</LI>
<LI>MSBuild</LI>
<LI>Team Foundation Server</LI></UL>
<P>It would also be a good opportunity to delve deeper into CSLA for anyone ready to take their knowledge to the next level. Basically, I am asking this of the community because working on the core components is enough to keep me more than busy and unless I get someone new to create these templates it probably will not happen.</P>
<P>Also, for anyone experienced with code generators already you may find this project interesting. It has a somewhat different take on the process and brings some new features to the table. Check it out, drop some questions/comments in the forums.</P>
<P>So if you're interested in working on some CSLA templates head on over to the project page and find my email address on the main wiki there.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
