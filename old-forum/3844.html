(e.g. a "+" is displayed next to the parent rows, and when you expand them, you get an embedded tab control with tabs show each child collection you have exposed).</P>
<P>The problem is that when you go from a row to one of its child collections, you "leave" the parent row, at which point ERLB saves the parent in its current state. </P>
<P>There are at least two related issues, one of which is that if the parent was dirty, it has now been replaced by its clone and the child collections displayed are effectively orphaned. </P>
<P>More generally, though, even if the parent wasn't dirty, it doesn't look like the object is even being "edited" once you leave the parent row for a child collection. I can see BeginEdit() being called for the rows in the child collection, but their EditLevel is 0 at this point. </P>
<P>Any thoughts on how to support this type of binding?</P>
