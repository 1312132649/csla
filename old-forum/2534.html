<P>Now I've had VERY poor experience with products which claim to generate full apps like that at the push of a button (would you even want them to?), but was just curious if anyone had seen this product or used it and had any impressions they could share?</P>
<P>Cheers!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
