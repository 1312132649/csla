<p>Right now I only know if a child is dirty, is there a way to know if a property of the child is dirty?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 17, 2010</h2><p>By default CSLA only tracks whether an object is dirty, not each property. Jason Bock wrote a blog post describing how to extend CSLA 3.8 and higher to track this at a property level, so you could do that.</p>
<p>Also, you might use the ChildChanged event/override to monitor child object&#39;s as they change - because the parameters to that event/override provide you with the name of the property that was changed.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
