<p>IIRC, with Silverlight the Csla business object could flow from the Silverlight client to the application server running Asp.Net via WCF or whatever remoting mechanism configured.</p>
<p>I&#39;m assuming WinRT apps function the same way; my question is it possible to have theWinRT app serialize and deserialize when the app server is running under Asp.Net 4?&nbsp; Does it just work, or will there be extra configuration required?</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to determine if I would need to have my client provider a server capable of running .Net 4.5, which Win2k3 does not.</p>
<p>TIA</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, December 11, 2012</h2><p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Yes, this was the primary reason for adding CSLA for NET 4 as .NET 4.5 was not supported in Azure (until early november IIRC).</p>
<p>Rocky used this for his demo at VS Live in august.<br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/CslaNet/posts/10151075933236912">https://www.facebook.com/CslaNet/posts/10151075933236912</a> </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
