<P>I'm a newbie recently started development using CSLA framework. I have a&nbsp;functionality that requires me to implement business objects with whole-part relationship for which I was thinking on using Composite Pattern. However, I'm not sure if I can do&nbsp;so without losing any of the benefits of CSLA.</P>
<P>I would really appreciate if someone can explain if this can be done and how and also if there are alternate approaches.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
