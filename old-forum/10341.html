<p>Anyone? :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JCardina replied on Thursday, June 16, 2011</h2><p>Yeah there weren&#39;t a lot of people jumping in with this, I guess the set of people using CSLA and doing MVVM and using Prism is quite small.&nbsp; So I just went ahead and jumped in to coding a sample app.</p>
<p>So far so good for me.&nbsp; In fact as I&#39;ve learned more I&#39;ve come to learn that the two are not really related and there are not likely to be any issues no matter what framework you choose to save typing with.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t gone into the depth enough to really be any kind of expert on this yet, or even a minor know it all. :)</p>
<p>I&#39;m working on a proof of concept / reference implementation and I have a grid that displays a business object list and most of my time has been sucked into that lately but I&#39;m hoping to also have an editable root object used on an edit form opened from the grid really soon just as soon as I put the finishing touches on my custom wpf datagrid / CSLA Read only list base paging code to ensure I can in equal time fill the grid from a 1000 record source as well as a 1 million record source.</p>
<p>(there&#39;s a lot to be said for generating a big fat sample database before you start really coding seriously)</p>
<p>MVVM seems so complicated at first but eventually you learn that there really is nothing to it, literally, there is nothing to it, it&#39;s almost all convention and you&#39;re on your own for most of it so there is really no mystery, just various ways of saving typing and code re-use.</p>
<p>We&#39;re definitely sticking with Prism for all the benefits it gives for our WPF and Silverlight UI&#39;s.&nbsp; I&#39;d be happy to try to answer any questions you might have but again, I&#39;m very far from an expert.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vijaygill replied on Wednesday, June 29, 2011</h2><p>In addition to what people have said so far, I am also working on a framework to use Prism &amp; CSLA together and things are going pretty smooth but a bit complex.</p>
<p>May be I am over-engineering it as I am trying to have classes for each use-case ( like one class Customer for having editable customer, another read-only customer for search grid, and another customer class for using in say Order class. This is a typical P-O-C application using customer, orders, order-details etc).</p>
<p>Also things are bit slow because I am the only person working on it and also I am trying to get things in to some form of a code generator which takes class definition from an XML file (we will write a designer for that too later).</p>
<p>By now it is clear that we will stick with Prism and CSLA.</p>
<p>Edited:</p>
<p>Just keep it in mind that these two frameworks are too flexible so it is very easy to get carried away in over-engineering (probably I did already :) ) so know well where to draw the line.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I &#39;m developing silverlight project consisting 200 more views&nbsp;&nbsp;with CSLA4.1 + PRISM 4.0 + MVVM + MEF + EF 4.0, and I&#39;d like to&nbsp;add my 2cents of experience.</p>
<p>1.MVVM</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel&nbsp; more comfortable in Csla.xaml than any other MVVM framework,actually I tried a few,because view/viewmodel/model matches&nbsp;&nbsp;so beautifully that I nearly don&#39;t use even command of prism in between view/viewmodel.&nbsp; Especially keep in mind &nbsp;the approaches of Rocky&#39;s MVVM video when designing viewmodel. lmagine we have a parent-child edit form in right region with readonly&nbsp;object gridview in&nbsp;left region, then we may have 1 big vm which has all three object. Yes it looks simple at first but&nbsp;become too complex in vm. &nbsp;Or we may have 2 vm as 1 for list view and 1 for edit form, which was&nbsp;the often case of mine in winform days with SCSF + CSLA.&nbsp;However, if we have 3 vm for each object or 4 vm with 3 object + 1 child edit object,&nbsp;it really simplifies all intervention in between viwe/model. Though I read book and video and Rocky advised to separate vm for every view unit,&nbsp;I made 2 vm at first with my humble experience and realized the real role of&nbsp;viewmodel after spending&nbsp;so much hours to solve coupling problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;PRISM</p>
<p>I think why CSLA matches PRISM very well is both&nbsp;framework&nbsp;targets use case driven approach. I often use Controller,nearly same concept as in the SCSF&#39;s workItemController as a&nbsp;use case manager and he manages view open and communication between various viewmodels in a use case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp;dependancy injection container,&nbsp; MEF would be&nbsp;better than Unitity container&nbsp;because MEF included in .Net&nbsp;4.0&nbsp;and no need to add&nbsp;dependancy module such as Unity&nbsp;but it needs more learning curve&nbsp;if you don&#39;t have a experience yet. If you are first time in prism, then Unity is definitely easy to start. If you include Rx Extension,LINQ of event,&nbsp;in prism, it wud be more flexible in event aggregation.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;wish you may have&nbsp;a little help with my humble experience and poor english. Good luck.</p>

<p>Can you pls make like a demo app using those two (Prism and CSLA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would really appreciate.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
