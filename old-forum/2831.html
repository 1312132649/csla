This is my class signature:<br><br><blockquote>Serializable()&gt; _<br>Public MustInherit Class MyBusinessListBase( _<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of T As MyBusinessListBase(Of T, C), _<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C As BusinessBase(Of C))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inherits BusinessListBase(Of T, C)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implements ITypedList<br></blockquote>Does this look correct? My primary purpose at this point is the implementation of the ITypedList.<br><br>This compiles just fine, but when I try to create a datasource from it and assign it to the DataSource property of a BindingSource, I get an error:<br>"BindingSource unable to create list based on the Type specified in the DataSource property."<br><br>Thanks for any insights.<br>Barry<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bgilbert replied on Monday, May 07, 2007</h2>I just found out that if I add a public constructor to the class that inherits from this list class, it seems to work. I guess it's a reasonab;e workaround, but I don't entirely understand why this is necessary. <br><br>Barry<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
