Can the data context objects based off of Devart.Data.Linq.DataContext created by this third party be used with the ContextManager in CSLA?  If not, what might be some work-arounds?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 25, 2009</h2><P>If their datacontext inherits from Microsoft's DataContext then yes, otherwise no. The constraint on the generic type is "DataContext", and there's no other real option since Microsoft's DataContext appears to be a direct base class (it doesn't inherit from or implement anything more general).</P>
<P>If they don't inherit from Microsoft's DataContext, then the "work around" is to copy-paste the DataContext code from CSLA, change the generic constraint to be their context type and basically create a different manager class.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
