It's a WPF Application. I have a &nbsp;custom principal object derived from BusinessPrincipalBase implementing IPrincipal. At the Login the Thread.CurrentPrincipal is seem to be set correctly by Cslaâ€™s ApplicationContext.User &nbsp;property &nbsp;. But , debugging future method calls from the same program instance, Thread.CurrentPrincipal's Principal wouldn't be the same as that of the current logged in user. Not sure how to set this WPF main thread's principal object so that it doesn't lose the Thread.CurrentPrincipal at any time.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>Any suggestions to fix this issue?</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, October 30, 2007</h2><P>There is a large section in the new eBook that explains how to use the Principal in WPF.</P>
