<P>well, thanks in advance.</P>

<P>After I wrote mine I noticed that it closely matched the MS DAAB so I felt comfortable with the code. The DAAB is a fine block of code to use.</P>
<P>It allows you to write very simple code in your DataPortal_XYZ methods.</P>

<P>I'm curious to see how they look, would you mind posting a sample?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, October 18, 2007</h2><P>Just download the MS DAAB to see how it is built.</P>
<P>It has&nbsp;many overloads for each of the methods so you have a ton of flexibility in how to call it.</P>
<P>e.g.<BR>dr = <FONT color=#0000ff size=2>New</FONT><FONT size=2> SafeDataReader(DAL.ExecuteReader(cn, "SomeSP", prm))</FONT></P>
<P>Above is a call to&nbsp;my DAL to get a data reader.</P>
<P>I pass in the connection and SP name and a pararm array.</P>
<P>The DAL takes care of attaching the parameters.</P>
<P>Other overloads include passing a connection string or a transaction.</P>
<P>Or a SQL String or ....</P>

<P>What version of&nbsp; MS DAAB are you using? I donwloaded 'Enterprise Library May 2007.msi' yesterday. I presume I don't need the whole Enterprise Library just the DAL?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We started out looking at some free OR Mappers (which can do much more than just CRUD, but also can provide a good basic DAL). Currently, we have CSLA bolted onto a DAL layer based on the Wilson ORMapper and Welter CodeSmith templates. NHibernate is another good mapper.&nbsp; (Some would argue the mappers are overkill, but both of these support a large number of different databases from the same DAL)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As far as Microsoft technology (e.g. LINQ), it's a fair bet that anything Microsoft does DAL-wise will (1) be biased toward&nbsp; Microsoft products (e.g. SQL Server), and (2) will change in the future -- anyone remember DAO? ADO 1.0?. So, I advise putting a layer between you and anything Microsoft specific to insulate you from future changes. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Friday, October 19, 2007</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>rsbaker0:</strong></div><div>

<P>(1) DLINQ currently is Microsoft biased only supporting Sql Server.&nbsp; I believe they have opened the door for vendors to write their own libraries, but I wouldn't expect support for other databases until some time after .Net 3.5 comes out.</P>
<P>(2) This is true for&nbsp;ANY product, not just Microsoft.</P>
