<p>Thanks in advance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Friday, March 01, 2013</h2><p>Have you looked at the sample solutions in the <a href="https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/zipball/master">main download</a>? There is a MVC sample project in that zip file. Or do you have a specific question about it?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hi2bapi replied on Friday, March 01, 2013</h2><p>I wanted to know, how the method will be designed in wcf so that data can be passed from mvc using csla architecture. For example, i want to do insert operation in wcf then which type of object should i pass from mvc and do the needfull.<br /><br />My current project solution having following projects :</p>
<p>1. Common 2. Dal 3. DalEF 4. wcfService 5. Library 6.MVCWebsite<br /><br /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Friday, March 01, 2013</h2><p>Others here can provide a better answer to your particular situation.&nbsp;It sounds like you&#39;re trying to roll your own WCF service or already have an existing WCF service, is that right?</p>
<p>In my use of CSLA with MVC (as well as with WinRT, WPF, SL) CSLA takes care of the WCF calls between the tiers in a physical n-tier app. For example, my MVC project references the CSLA binaries as well as my CSLA Library project (which contains the business objects). If I need a three-tier physical deployment (website, app server and database server), I expose a WCF endpoint on an app server running IIS. That endpoint consumes the same business objects that are also referenced by the front end. And&nbsp;a setting in the MVC web.config file tells CSLA where to look for that WCF endpoint when making database calls. Not sure if that is helpful. Maybe someone else can chime in.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hi2bapi replied on Friday, March 01, 2013</h2><p>Thanks for reply Tim. Can you please give 1 sample application considering my project architecture.<br /><br />My question is how to design wcf service and consume in my mvc web?<br /><br />Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Friday, March 01, 2013</h2><p>Have you already created a WCF service? Or are you starting your project from scratch?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hi2bapi replied on Friday, March 01, 2013</h2><p>No i have not started yet. I just suck at wcf that how the method will be written for insert operation and how can i send the data from mvc. So far i have created dtos and business layer using businessbase in library project.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Friday, March 01, 2013</h2><p>If you download the latest version using the link I originally posted, there is a Samples directory in the zip file. There are a number of projects, but the one in particular that looks like your best bet is called &quot;CslaMVC.&quot; It can be found through this path in the zip file contents:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">MarimerLLC-csla-V4-5-12-38-gf867ba7.zip\MarimerLLC-csla-f867ba7\Samples\NET\cs\CslaMVC\</p>
<p>I would highly recommend buying the &quot;<a href="http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;CategoryID=4&amp;List=1&amp;SortField=DateCreated+DESC%2cProductName&amp;Level=1&amp;ProductID=27">Using CSLA 4: ASP.NET MVC</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;CategoryID=4&amp;List=1&amp;SortField=DateCreated+DESC%2cProductName&amp;Level=1&amp;ProductID=26">Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration</a>&quot; e-books that Rocky created. In fact, the whole series is very helpful, but these books might give you what you need if you&#39;re already familiar with object design.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hi2bapi replied on Friday, March 01, 2013</h2><p>Tim can you please help me out?
