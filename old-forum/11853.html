But the new download page on GitHub seems to indicate that the latest stable version is 4.5.10 and the latest beta version is 4.5.12. Am I looking at something wrong? How did the version go backwards? Is it normal for release version numbers&nbsp;to be behind the beta/RC version numbers?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>richardb replied on Monday, February 25, 2013</h2><p>4.5.Three &lt; 4.5.Ten &lt; 4.5.Twelve</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Monday, February 25, 2013</h2><p>Duh...I wasn&#39;t thinking in those terms. Thinking instead of decimals for some reason. Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 25, 2013</h2><p>I&#39;ve adopted a version numbering scheme that I hope will be consistent for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Ideally I&#39;d use the build number - something like 4.5.1.x and increment &#39;x&#39; for small changes.</p>
<p>But not all the Microsoft platforms (notably Silverlight) honor the build number, so it turns out to be useless.</p>
<p>As a result, all I have to work with is major.minor.revision</p>
<p>Major and Minor are pretty easy - I try to keep those in sync with the primary .NET framework version I&#39;m targeting.</p>
<p>And that leaves Revision to cover everything else - like adding support for WP8, or mono, or ...</p>
<p>My scheme then is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Revision ends in a zero (such as 10, 20, 30, etc.) that&#39;s a release</li>
<li>If the Revision ends in a non-zero (such as 11, 12, 23, 42, etc.) that&#39;s a pre-release building toward the next zero ending</li>
</ul>
<p>So right now I&#39;m prepping 4.5.13, which is a pre-release for the upcoming 4.5.20 release.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
