<P>This is a major update to CSLA .NET, because it supports Silverlight, but also because there are substantial enhancements to the Windows/.NET version.</P>
<P>To my knowledge, this is also the first release of a major development framework targeting the Silverlight platform.</P>
<P>Here are some highlights:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Share more than 90% of your business object code between Windows and Silverlight 
<LI>Powerful new UI controls for WPF, Silverlight and Windows Forms 
<LI>Asynchronous data portal, to enable object persistence on a background thread (required in Silverlight, optional in Windows) 
<LI>Asynchronous validation rules 
<LI>Enhanced indexing in LINQ to CSLA 
<LI>Numerous performance enhancements</LI></UL>
<P>This version of CSLA .NET for Windows is covered in my new <A href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430210191"><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>Expert C# 2008 Business Objects</FONT></STRONG></A> book (<A href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430216387"><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>Expert VB 2008 Business Objects</FONT></STRONG></A> is planned for February 2009).</P>
<P>At this time there is no book covering CSLA .NET for Silverlight. However, most business object code (other than data access) is the same for Windows and Silverlight, so you will find the Expert C# 2008 Business Objects book very valuable for Silverlight as well. I am in the process of creating a series of training videos around CSLA .NET for Silverlight, watch for those in early 2009.</P>
<P>Version 3.6 marks the first time major development was done by a team of people. My employer, <A href="http://magenic.com"><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>Magenic</FONT></STRONG></A>, has been a patron of CSLA .NET since the year 2000, but with this version they provided me with a development team and that is what enabled such a major version to be created in such a relatively short period of time. You can see a <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?area=4&amp;id=bbe426f7-cd06-482f-bfa7-ec5640296562"><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>full list of contributors</FONT></STRONG></A>, but I specifically want to thank Sergey Barskiy, Justin Chase and Nermin Dibek because they are the primary contributors to 3.6. I seriously couldn't have asked for a better team!</P>
<P>This is also the first version where the framework code is only in C#. The framework can be <EM>used</EM> from any .NET language, including VB, C# and others, but the actual framework code is in C#.</P>
<P>There is a community effort underway to bring the VB codebase in sync with version 3.6, but at this time that code will not build. In any case, the official version of the framework is C#, and that is the version I recommend using for any production work.</P>
<P>In some ways version 3.6 is one of the largest release of the CSLA .NET framework ever. If you are a Windows/.NET developer this is a natural progression from previous versions of the framework, providing better features and capabilities. If you are a Silverlight developer the value of CSLA .NET is even greater, because it provides an incredible array of features and productivity you won't find anywhere else today.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jgamba replied on Thursday, December 18, 2008</h2>Rocky congratulations,<br><br>I've been eagerly awaiting this release.

<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The problem is that we incorporated the C5 codebase into CSLA. This
is not my code, it is an external project we&#8217;re using to gain access to
some data structures. Their code has numerous warnings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Now I could modify that code to eliminate the warnings (maybe). But
then I&#8217;m stuck maintaining alterations to code created/maintained by
someone else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Or I could put that code into a separate project, in which case
you&#8217;d have to deploy Csla.dll and C5.dll at all times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So I&#8217;m kind of stuck with no good choices here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>To be fair, the only data structure we&#8217;re using is a
red-black balanced binary tree. So yet another alternative is for someone (you
perhaps? :) ) to create that data structure as an independent unit of code that
we can incorporate into CSLA &#8211; thus avoiding the need to use C5 at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Congratulations on the new release; it's a great product!&nbsp; I have one

<P>I have been eagerly awaiting this release and am going to pour over the book as fast as I can.&nbsp; (I received it yesterday from Amazon.com).&nbsp; As I am going to dig into all aspects of it and understand it for a large application I am in the process of designing and devleoping.&nbsp; Thanks so much for all your work Rocky as your framework makes things so much easier for us developers to hammer out applications.</P>
<P>Another great product to help out us developers!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, December 23, 2008</h2><P>I think I've read this on another thread before, but I wanted to emphasize that it would be good to download the Silverlight 2 DataGrid December 2008 Release. It handles a number of errors with the DataGrid including disappearing rows, etc. </P>
<P>Also, a slight element of confusion for some will be that it appears that the combo box isn't keyboard editable. While there is an element to the DataGrid fix that talks about ComboBoxes taking the grid out of edit mode or something to that effect, I noticed that hand selecting values from the combo box requires LEFT AND RIGHT arrow keys, not up and down. A little thing, but during evaluation I had started to become disheartened when it looked like I needed to use the mouse to select from the combobox. </P>
<P>Finally what appears to be a bug - I don't know enough yet to discern if this is a CSLA thing or a Silverlight thing, but the titles are not appearing when selecting a company. After one saves, though, they all magically fill in. So I'm not exactly sure what's happening with that. </P>
