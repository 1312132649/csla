<p>So I&#39;d like to see an example that uses CSLA in Silverlight with WCF without BXF.&nbsp; In particular, the way that objects are handled on the service end of things.&nbsp; Once I understand that plumbing I&#39;d be happy to move onto a MVVM frankework, but not until I&#39;ve got a better idea of what life is like without one.</p>
<p>Does such a thing exist?</p>

<p>Perhaps what you may be talking about are the ViewModel classes that are implemented in CSLA; those provide some hooks into a MVVM-style programming model for CSLA objects.&nbsp; But even those don&#39;t do a whole lot - they just provide some bindable properties to CSLA actions/properties.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you could narrow the question, we might be able to provide something.&nbsp; A lot of the &quot;service end of things&quot; is hidden in the DP, even for Silverlight...</p>

<p>Obviously, that isn&#39;t going to work since I need to have a Server version of an object and a Client version of an object (CSLA Business Object) so that I can use the slick rule system.</p>
<p>So I&#39;d like to see how to set up a simple service that works with CSLA objects without BXF and without the CSLA.XAML viewmodel.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that I&#39;ve an example of a CSLA object working as a CSLA object (Silverlight version) on the client and using the dataportal to serialize the object back to the server where the CSLA object (Windows version) may persist to a database.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would need to return the persisted object as well, I&#39;d imagine.</p>
<p>That is probably one of my main barriers to learning this stuff.&nbsp; So much gets automatically created in the background (and the examples assume all of that) that actually finding out how stuff works can be difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is NO WAY in hell I&#39;m going to mess around with the Entity Framework - I&#39;m sure it&#39;s slick but if one more magic button gets added to my code I&#39;ll just switch to Access and call it a day.<img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 28, 2011</h2><p>You may want to read the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series. I walk through data access and the data portal in some detail - including Silverlight.</p>
<p>Books 1-4 provide all that basic background. Book 5 (in progress) does use Bxf, because you need <em>something</em> to provide structure to the Presentation Layer of a XAML application (or fall back to code-behind like Windows Forms, but I&#39;m not going there...).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 28, 2011</h2><p>Although this is a little dated now, it is mostly correct:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/UsingCSLALightPart4.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/UsingCSLALightPart4.aspx</a></p>
<p>And it does use code-behind - no UI framework at all - so it is purely focused on the CSLA aspects.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t build an app following the UI concepts in that blog post series - but it may be helpful in getting you started with the data portal anyway.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Thursday, July 28, 2011</h2><p>Thank you guys.</p>
<p>I fully intend to use either BXF, MVVM Light, or a UI MVVM framework of my own creation.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before I jump into using a framework it really, really helps me to understand some of the issues that the framework fixes.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, creating a Command object the manual way really helped me appreciate what Josh Smith&#39;s relay command class brings to the table.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#39;ve now successfully built a Silverlight project that has&nbsp; Library.Client and Library.Server projects where the Silverlight client uses the client library and the web service uses the server library - serializing the object from one version of it to the other and saving the object and returning it back to the client.&nbsp; (Way cool stuff, BTW).</p>
<p>So your posts do a nice job of getting to the root of my question - how to do all that&nbsp;with CSLA business objects the DataPortal way.&nbsp; Once I can handle the Dataportal approach successfully using code behind I&#39;ll then make the transition to BXF.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that people who&#39;ve mastered these things forget just how much learning is involved in all of this - Silverlight, XAML, WCF, BXF, CSLA, etc.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I&#39;ve a really, really simple project that I get to do all of this with some I&#39;m using it as my first Silverlight project/learning project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Friday, July 29, 2011</h2><p>I actually ended up reading all 4 blog posts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I managed to get all of this working today (on my test machine and published to a live server) so I get to go home this week after having some success.&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward to putting it all together with an MVVM framework - that will be next week&#39;s challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s going to be nice to have a nice modern interface that is responsive and slick.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
