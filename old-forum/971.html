(in French : "Label est requis")<br><br>I thus think that I must modify the error message to obtain a message of the type: “Necessary Field”.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;See another solution? <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>figuerres replied on Monday, August 21, 2006</h2><P>I am learning where all the bits are in CSLA where is that text coming from?</P>
<P>part of the "Core" has a set of resource files and has a number of strings in each language.</P>
<P>if the text is in the stock csla then I'd say locate where it is and post that info along with what you feel the resource file should have for the french version.</P>
<P>if it's in your code then use the core as an example and put your strings in a resource file and that way it can work for multiple languages.</P>
