The problem is;&nbsp;I need to edit the nodes. If I use a businesslist I need to save the list to save the node. if I use a read only list I can&#39;t use a business base object. If I use a read only object, then create a businessbase object for editing I then have to sync the object in the tree with the saved object which can be a problem with async silverlight. Any suggestions on how to work around this? Again, this is silverlight mvvm. </p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
