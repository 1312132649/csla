Microsoft's comparison chart doesn't help either.</P>
<P>If you don't get an answer here, maybe you could try at Microsoft's forums:</P>

<P>Sorry I can't provide more info than that, but if that's the case, I don't know if there's a solution besides upgrading VS.</P>

All the important info is in the script files in the project, which are in clear text and so should be easily readable and can be run against the database easily enough by using osql or some other command line utility (Red Gate just released a nice SQL command line for free come to think of it).</P>
<P>Alternately, the databases are <EM>really</EM> trivial, and are completely described in Chapter 7, so you can just create the databases from scratch in a few minutes.</P>
<P>As I state in the Introduction, the book does require VS 2005 Professional - though it is true that almost everything (with a few exceptions obviously) can be done with even VS Express.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>irelandk replied on Saturday, March 03, 2007</h2><P>I received the same error message when opening ProjectTracker20vb.&nbsp; Can anyone advise?</P>
<P>Specifically, I downloaded VB version of CSLA 2.1.4.&nbsp; I built the CSLA project without a problem.&nbsp; When opening ProjectTracker20vb.sln, I receive the following error message:</P>
<P>"Application type for project ...\PTDATA\ptdata.dbp is not installed"</P>
<P>All of the other projects in the solution opened without a problem.</P>
<P>I am running VS Studio 2005 Standard Edition.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>irelandk replied on Saturday, March 03, 2007</h2>Sorry - never mind.&nbsp; For some reason, when I first looked at this topic, I only saw the initial question and not any of the responses.&nbsp; Once I posted, the other responses became visible.&nbsp; Anyway, it looks like I can work around this.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
