All the permissions are placed in the Project class - CanAdd, CanEdit, CanDelete. <br /><br />My question : Is it possible to have permissions at the ProjectResources level. To have permission for adding, and removing of child objects ? Is this practical ? If so, how would I achieve this ?<br /><br />Thanks</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
