So it mostly displays the top row, and then randomly displays another row (the last one?) thrown in for good measure.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, June 17, 2008</h2>Ugh... I think I found the problem, in case this affects anyone else.<br><br>I'm using Linq to get the data, and I had the IsPrimaryKey set on a column which was not the primary key, and had only two values.&nbsp; So Linq was giving me the first row that differed by that key for every other row with the same value.&nbsp; Opps.<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
