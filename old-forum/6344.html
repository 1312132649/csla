<P>In our legacy systems, we don't use a "grid' per-say, but we do have multiple rows of controls that are automatically created for us - so let's say you have in each row/child object: </P>
<P>Product (drop down selection), Quantity, and Notes.</P>
<P>The behavior that I like about our legacy system is that there is a natural flow from row to row - tabbing across fields 1-3 occur, users can edit fields as they like, and a subsequent tab will drop them down to the next row, column 0, in edit mode. Tabbing from the final field in the final row will add a new row (child object). Further, there is no real differentiation in appearance between a row in "edit mode" and one that isn't in edit mode.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I was trying to get this sort of behavior to happen in my grid and by using templated columns it seems like&nbsp;I can have everything look editable all the time, but one thing I couldn't seem to figure out was how to get the tabbing to act as I wanted. Specifically, let's say you capture tab-down on the final control in the final column - how do you change the user's focus to the next row? I was able to change the current column but I couldn't see anything in the grid's object model to let me change which row the user was on. </P>
<P>Perhaps I'm missing something else, but if anyone has any insight, I'd love to hear it. I've been contemplating just using a vertical stackpanel of controls that each will provide the editing of a child object (i.e. shying away from a grid) to get the behavior that I want. </P>
