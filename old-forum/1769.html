There could be a lot, and my only question is how to manage them or at what granularity they should be.<br><br>Right now there are 3-5 codesmith template projects, the cslacontrib.dll project (which includes the new SmartXYZ types, etc), a couple different add-on controls and the VS templates.<br><br>So I think, but don't know for sure, that we're talking about perhaps 10 different groups?<br><br>I also think some effort/consolidation needs to occur around the cslacontrib.dll idea. David has his code files, but then there's the IBindingListView implementation, that really should go into that same project. And the VB/C# project structures aren't remotely consistent at this time.<br><br>I envision something along the lines of nant and nantcontrib in this regard. If all source contributions can be consolidated into a single cslacontrib.dll project it would make them far easier for people to consume than the current scheme of having disparate code files that need to be manually cobbled together.<br><br>The code-gen templates are in better shape, mostly because they don't need to be combined into some unit of executable code.<br><br>I don't have the time to become coordinator of the community efforts, so I'm hopeful that someone (or some group) can work to get all the efforts coordinated and consolidated in an easy-to-consume manner.<br><br>But back to the forum thing - how do you guys foresee this working? We should have a naming convention for the forums within the CSLAcontrib umbrella, and there needs to be some reasonable way by which I can know which project groups want their own forum space.<br><br>Also, please be aware that I can't provide email support for these forums. I have a limited number of email addresses to use, and would instantly run out... So, like the current cslacontrib forum, these forums will be web only.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, December 15, 2006</h2><P>This thread didn't go anywhere <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
<P>I really am not opposed to this idea, if we can figure out a way it makes logistical sense.</P>
<P>CS allows for the idea of forum groups. One thing I could do (I think) is create a forum group for CSLAcontrib, and have forums within that group.</P>
<P>I would suggest that there should NOT be a "general" forum under that group, or it will be confusing whether to post in a targeted group or the general group. What this means, though, is that we need to identify which groups do need to exist. A couple are obvious:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Code-gen templates</LI>
<LI>VS templates/snippets</LI>
<LI>CSLAcontrib assembly</LI></UL>
<P>In my view, all add-on classes/types/code should be ultimately merged into a CslaContrib.dll&nbsp; This would include SmartInt, the IBindingListView implementation and any other code that fits into a DLL to be used. This is not how it is working today, but it should be done this way for ease of use by people wanting to consume this content.</P>
<P>There are various competing code templates, but I think they can all be handled within a single forum area - that might help lead to good cross-polination and sharing of ideas.</P>
<P>The same might eventually be true for the VS templates, though it isn't the case today.</P>
<P>This is all speculation on my part though - I don't want to set this up in a unilateral manner - I'd prefer if the CSLAcontrib contributors figure out what should happen and I can set it up.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Friday, December 15, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>

<P>I suspect what many contributors of CSLA library code extensions really want is for you to incorporate their extensions into CSLA proper. :)</P>
<P>That said, the three areas you mentioned are the natural breaks in the subject matter.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>admin replied on Thursday, January 18, 2007</h2><P>OK, I have rearranged the contrib forums as discussed, so there are now three and they are in a group of their own.</P>
<P>At the moment, David, I have no mechanism by which I can safely include contributed code into CSLA .NET itself. I have considered changing that policy, and have done some preliminary research into the legal matters related to this, but it isn't my top priority at the moment.</P>

<P>Um...&nbsp; Where are they?&nbsp; They don't show up where the old one did.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, January 25, 2007</h2><P>Where are they on the CslaContrib site you mean? I don't know. Microsoft appears to have rearranged the format and capabilities of CodePlex, and the original rss aggregation concept seems to be gone.</P>
<P>Instead, they appear to have some wiki tag to bring an rss feed into a page, but I don't see anything indicating that you could aggregate multiple feeds into one display...</P>
<P>One step forward, two back?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Friday, January 26, 2007</h2><P>You used to have 3 forums on your site, one was for the Contributions.&nbsp; I understood that you split the Contributions forum into 3 forums on your site.&nbsp; But I don't see those new forums, or the old one for that matter.&nbsp; Is there some type of "Make Public" setting you forgot to set?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, January 26, 2007</h2><P>Forums can be, and are, organized into forum groups. My guess is that you are getting to the site using a forum group link that only shows the original group.</P>
<P>To keep the contributions forums organized, I put them in their own forum group.</P>
<P>Click the Forums button at the top of the page to see all the forum groups and forums.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Monday, January 29, 2007</h2><P>Ah... I see!&nbsp; &nbsp; CSLA.Net Framework is A forum, not THE forum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Had to go up one more level.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
