<P>I have some problem with old csla poject. I had a CSLA based project with CSLA on .Net framework 2.0. The application run perfectly but customer want to apply new change and i need to maintain this project.</P>
<P>This application is written with VS 2005, but now i use VS 2008 to modify it. When i open, a dialog box appear to ask for update solution. I choose update but do not change framework target (remaining .Net framework 2.0). After that i build solution and test in debug mode. When i browser for url of web application i get message:</P>
<P>"<EM>Could not load file or assembly 'PresentationCore' or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format." </EM></P>
<P>I could not understand what was happen with my project. </P>
<P>I have install .Net framework 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5.</P>
<P>I use CSLA version 3.0.2 on Windows XP x64 edition with Visual Studio 2008</P>
<P>Thanks so much.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hanami279 replied on Sunday, March 30, 2008</h2><P>Hi,</P>
<P>After few hour to search by Google i found out that, this is a problem with .Net framework, not CSLA.</P>
<P>I go to "bin" directory of web project and delete two file:</P>
<P>PresentationCore.dll and System.Printing.dll</P>
<P>And everything is back to normal.</P>
<P>As i want to share exp with others peopel maybe in same situation like me.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
