They often use different versions of CSLA (3.0.2, 3.0.4, 3.5.1, etc). Yes, I know we should all use the same versions, but that's a discussion for another time.<br><br>I've written a handful of class libraries that use CSLA. If I compile one of these against, say, CSLA 3.0.2, and a developer wants to use it with CSLA 3.0.4, they either have to recompile it, or add a&nbsp; "dependentAssembly" entry in their app.config file. This isn't horrible, but if the class library also installs components in the Visual Studio Pallette, it becomes more difficult.<br><br>So currently I compile multiple versions of my libraries, each using a different version of CSLA. This makes it easier for the developers to use the libraries without any extra work. However, this is a PITA for me.<br><br>What I'd like to know is, what other ways are there to handle this? For instance, can I compile a class library against version 3.0.2, yet tell it that it's OK to go ahead and try to use a later version if that's what's referenced in the developer's project, so the developer doesn't have to add a dependentAssembly entry?<br><br>If not, and the best thing is to compile multiple versions, any ideas on how to automate this? Right now I put all the sources in a shared folder structure, and create multiple projects that all link to these files. Each project references a different version of CSLA, the output goes to different folders, and each output library gets different version information so you can tell them apart.<br><br>Any help would really be appreciated! And yes, if everyone used the same versions, life would be sweet. But I have no power to enforce this, and I'm not real good at "hearding cats".<br><br>Thanks in advance!<br><br>Dan<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
