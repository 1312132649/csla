So people who are interested can keep up to date, I have <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=3852b8d8-e2f7-4277-b77e-bf375125b6c9">updated the change log </a>with the latest feature changes. There are some pretty interesting changes to think about.</p>
<p>The reason I can&#39;t easily do another preview release is that VS10 RC has no publicly available SL4 release. So some of our work has been in Beta 2 (where SL4 works) and some of our work has been in RC. There are two branches in svn (/trunk is beta 2, RC is in a branch) where we&#39;re working - and eventually the RC branch will have to merge into trunk.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a mess, but there&#39;s no easy solution until Microsoft provides a public SL4 release that works with the RC.</p>
<p>So I could do a preview out of trunk, or a preview out of RC, but neither is the whole picture of the changes... For now updating the change log will have to be enough.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
