<p>Can someone please refer me to some information about the use of the Installer and where it does install the Csla?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>c:\program files {x86)\Marimer LLC\Csla\&lt;version&gt;</p>
<p>So it shouldn&#39;t mess up older versions, because I doubt you&#39;d create a folder structure like that one :)</p>
<p>The current installer also puts the source and samples into zip files in that folder, along with binaries to support Silverlight 4 in a zip file.</p>
<p>The 4.5 installer is a little different, because Microsoft dropped the setup project type in VS12. But it basically does the same thing, and into the same folder structure.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
