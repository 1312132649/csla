What is the proper way to do this?&nbsp; Would this be a case when I need to use the commandObject?</P>
<P>Any help greatly appreciated!</P>

<P>That would be a perfect case for using the CommandObject.&nbsp; Just follow Rocky's example of the ExistsCommand within the Project class of the ProjectTracker application.&nbsp; In your case it is even simpiler because you do not need to pass in a parameter (unless for some reason you would need to).&nbsp; I assume you will have an object named "Personnel".&nbsp; Just add a static RecordCount method (or some other similar type name) to your Personnel object.</P>
