I could not find the references via &quot;Add Reference --&gt; .NET&quot; tab, so I had to manually browse for them in the GAC (GAC_32, and GAC_MSIL). The references seemingly fixed, I attempted to build the Csla project and an error came back saying </p>
<p>&quot; Project file must include the .NET Framework assembly &#39;PresentationCore, PresentationFramework&#39; in the reference list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Csla&quot;</p>
<p>I clearly have the 2 references in the Csla references folder. Cleaning/Rebuilding the project, unloading/reloading the solution, even rebooting did not solve the issue. I&#39;m flabbergasted. Any ideas?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Csla 3.8.2 and .NET 3.5 (.NET 4.0 is installed on the machine 
however).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 30, 2010</h2><p>You are trying to build the Csla project and it can&#39;t find references? It sounds like your .NET install is somehow broken. Is .NET 3.5 SP1 installed on the machine, or just .NET 4?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ErikJL replied on Wednesday, June 30, 2010</h2><p>Looking in C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework, I have the following:</p>
<p>v1.0.3705</p>
<p>v1.1.4322</p>
<p>v2.0.50727</p>
<p>v3.5</p>
<p>v4.0.30319</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So no .NET 3.5 SP1 that I can see. I did run the .NET 4 installer and ran the &quot;Repair&quot; option, should have mentioned that in the original post. I will look for a 3.5 SP1 installer.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ErikJL replied on Wednesday, June 30, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;m running the .NET 3.5SP1 installer, and it appears that it&#39;s already installed: I only get the Repair and Remove options. I will move ahead with the Repair option.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ErikJL replied on Wednesday, June 30, 2010</h2><p>Ok I ran the .NET 3.5SP1 Repair option, and that worked. </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
