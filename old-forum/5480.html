The buttons on the form gets new properties, named ActionType, CommandType, DisableWhenClean, PostSaveAction, RebindSaveAction. I think these can make RebindUI method in forms obselete.<br><br>I cannot make it work, though. It seems at some point public method ResetActionBehaviors should be called, but even called manually returns error.<br><br>Sinan<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>stefan replied on Sunday, September 28, 2008</h2>Well, I had set it up like you mentioned, but then remembered that Rocky mentioned (I think it was in the last DNR show), <br>that we have to add the control and set all properties in code, using the designer would not work.<br><br>If you do so, it works to some extent (still beta).<br><br>Issues I found:<br>The WarnOnCancelMessage should not appear when the object is plain New without any property changes yet.<br>Cancelling should always disable the controls. It does not disable the buttons after a save (see below).<br><b>The cancel action only works till the first save! Try to cancel a modification on a previously saved object, <br>and you will be forced to restart the application as the form does not respond anymore!<br>[EDIT]<br>Well, after adding a BindingSourceRefresh control to the form it works better, but still not on a reliable basis.<br></b><br>But after all, this is the control all WinForm-developers have been waiting for! <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br><br>Stefan<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, October 01, 2008</h2><P>Miguel Castro wrote the control and contributed it to CSLA, and he just provided a sample:</P>

<P>Hopefully that helps.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fredg replied on Thursday, February 23, 2012</h2><p>Hi, the link for the <span style="font-family:TheSansMonoConSemiLight;font-size:xx-small;"><span style="font-family:TheSansMonoConSemiLight;font-size:xx-small;">CslaActionExtender sample is broken. Is there any other sample code?</span></span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 23, 2012</h2><p>The sample is under either Tags or Branches (both actually) in the older versions of CSLA. We didn&#39;t have time to update it for CSLA 4 and .NET 4, so it got dropped out of trunk.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
