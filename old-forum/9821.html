<p><strong>&#39;Could not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or the neutral culture.&nbsp; Make sure &quot;CSLA.Resources.resources&quot; was correctly embedded or linked into assembly &quot;Csla&quot; at compile time, or that all the satellite assemblies required are loadable and fully signed.&#39;</strong></p>
<p>I have been searching for hours trying to figure out what is wrong. I have verified the CSLA project contains the Resources.resx under Properties and the build Action is set to &quot;Embedded Resource.&quot; I have tried everything I can think of including re-creating the Resources.resx file and re-compiling but&nbsp;my app&nbsp;is never happy.</p>
<p>My neutral language on all projects is set to (none). My OS is Windows 7&nbsp;US english. Anybody have any ideas? This is driving me crazy!</p>

<p>I still can&#39;t figure this one out.</p>
<p>Mike</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, December 15, 2010</h2><p>There is no SaveObject method on BusinessBase. Are you using a customized version or do you have some other code between your class and CSLA? Perhaps the issue is in that code?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BigPines2 replied on Wednesday, December 15, 2010</h2><p>Yes, it turned out to be a problem with Petar Kozul&#39;s ActiveObjects code creating a new ResourceManager. His code was&nbsp;referencing&nbsp;CSLA&#39;s localization using the path &quot;Csla.Resources.&quot; For anyone else who may be experiencing something similar, the correct path is &quot;Csla.Properties.Resources.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks again Rocky!</p>
