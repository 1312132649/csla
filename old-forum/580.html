<P>Why dont you out this code in a BasePage class (and put this in app_code) ? Then you can derive all your pages from this base class and also access this common helper method too.</P>
<P>I think it should work.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Microsoft have release an update for Visual Studio 2005 to allow for Web Application projects so you can have a single assembly...pretty much reverting to the old 1.1 way but with the advantage of 2005 features. Here is the URL...</FONT></P>
