Aren't BusinessListBase descendants editable?</P>

<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 05, 2008</h2><P>The EditableRootListBase class is described in the <A href="http://store.lhotka.net">CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</A>.</P>
<P>BLB can be a root or child, but it always <EM>contains</EM> child objects.</P>
<P>ERLB is only a root, and it always contains <EM>root</EM> objects. The terms I use are dynamic list and dynamic root (to differentiate from editable root list and editable root, which are different).</P>
<P>ERLB exists to address exactly one scenario: in-place editing of data in a Windows Forms (and in the future WPF and Silverlight) grid control, where changes made by the user are immediately committed as the user moves off each row.</P>
<P>BLB, on the other hand, provides for batch updates and is the more widely used option.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
