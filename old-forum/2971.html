<P>It also worked to just make that variable as type Object and cast it as a business object later in the code.&nbsp; But it gets tricky trying to think of every way that VisualStudio might stumble across some reference while in DesignMode=True.&nbsp; So this works well.&nbsp; I just handle the Load event on my BaseForm and if DesignMode = True then I call the serialization workaround code.</P>
<P>Just thought I would mention that here for others just incase they have similar trouble.</P>
