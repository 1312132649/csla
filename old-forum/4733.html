<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I am trying out the Windows Forms binding on a CSLA business object. I have bindingsource component linked to my custom business object called Role.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I have two text boxes on the form one for the Role Name and the other for the description.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>When I change the value within any of the textboxes and clicking straight on the save button the change is ignored and the value reverts back to the previous value. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Only when I tab out after changing and the clicking the save button does it save correctly. I am new to CSLA so I might be missing something simple here which I am sure is the case.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Thanks for you input and advice.</FONT></P>

You need to change the bindings to update on PropertyChanged instead of Validation. This can be done via the UI by going to the advanced properites of your databindings on the text boxes.<br><br>When you click save it's performing the save (without changes) and then returning the old object which the binding source detects and refreshes all the alues.<br><br>Marjon<br></font></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Joffies replied on Tuesday, April 22, 2008</h2><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Thanks Marjon, it works a treat! </FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, April 27, 2008</h2><P>You may also check if your buttons (and UI controls) has "CausesValidation" set to True. The validation event in your textbox is triggered by focusing another UI control in your form that has Causesvalitation set to true. </P>
