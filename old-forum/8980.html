<p>Thanks for any input.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, May 24, 2010</h2><p>The simplest way to handle XML data is often to just convert it into a string, and let the string go across the wire. You can easily convert the string back into an XML type (like XDocument or XElement) on the other side.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Larry replied on Monday, May 24, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Rocky!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
