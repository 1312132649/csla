<p>I am encountering a minor issue after upgrading our classes to CSLA 4.0 (with some revisions).&nbsp; Our previous version&#39;s Fetch routine loaded all field managers using LoadProperty.&nbsp; I have modified the Fetch routine as follows:</p>
<p>using(BypassPropertyChecks)</p>
<p>{&nbsp; </p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Field1 = dr.GetString(&quot;Id&quot;)</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">ChildCollection = ChildObject.GetChildObject(Field1)</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Prior to the ChildCollection assignment the isDirty property is false.&nbsp; If I change the ChildCollection assigment to utilize the LoadProperty the isDirty property is false.&nbsp; However after the assignment above the isDirty object for the property is true.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve manually evaluated each Child Object in the collection&#39;s isDirty value to be false as well.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; I could keep the LoadProperty or use the MarkOld method but wanted to ensure I have not overlooked anything.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I just solved it.&nbsp; Just in case anyone encounters a similar issue, check carefully your properties.&nbsp; It appears the childcollection property was using SetProperty instead of LoadProperty which caused the issue.</p>
