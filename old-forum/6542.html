<P>It is your call. Many years ago I adopted the rule to not trust the database either so I always run CheckRules when I fetch a BO. You never know what 3rd party apps and tools are modifying data directly in a database table. Many other devs do this too so I am not unique in this regard.</P>
<P>The framework does *not* make the call for you on Fetch (I think it does on Create but I 'd have to check ) so you have to decide if you want to do it for none, some or all BOs.</P>
