<p>Updating to Csla .NET 4.5.601 some .NET 4.0 projects under VS2010, I got plenty of errors and I could understand why. I migrated one of these projects to VS2012 and got the following error:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Common.targets(1605,5): warning MSB3268: The primary reference &quot;Csla&quot; could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the framework assembly &quot;System.Net.Http, Version=2.2.20.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a&quot; which could not be resolved in the currently targeted framework. &quot;.NETFramework,Version=v4.0,Profile=Client&quot;. To resolve this problem, either remove the reference &quot;Csla&quot; or retarget your application to a framework version which contains &quot;System.Net.Http, Version=2.2.20.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a&quot;.</p>
<p>The important part is this one:</p>
<p>The primary reference &quot;Csla&quot; could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the framework assembly &quot;System.Net.Http, Version=2.2.20.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a&quot; which could not be resolved in the currently targeted framework.</p>
<p>It turns out that a dependency is missing on the NuGet package,for .NET 4.0. Adding the NuGet package&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft.Net.Http</strong>&nbsp;to each project solved the iissue.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Monday, September 08, 2014</h2><p>Found the missing dependency and solved it. The original post was corrected. In what concerns .NET 4, there is a dependency missing on the NuGet package. Can our NuGet guru solve it?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mbblum replied on Thursday, September 11, 2014</h2><p>The&nbsp;issue occurred for me also when trying to update a 4.0 solution. Didn&#39;t have the time to track it down, so still on a&nbsp;previous&nbsp;release.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Saturday, September 13, 2014</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to fix though.</p>
<p>1) Open your solution on Visual Studio</p>
<p>2) Go to <strong>Manage NuGet packages for Solution</strong></p>
<p>3) On the left side, click <strong>Online</strong></p>
<p>4) Search for&nbsp;<b>Microsoft.Net.Http</b></p>
<p>5) Install the package on all the projects where Csla is installed</p>
<p>6) Now you can upgrade to Csla 4.5.601</p>
