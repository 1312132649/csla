I write some samples/tests/demos in C# and some in VB - some of them I share publicly, some I don't. None are supported, all are free.</P>
<P>Personally I recommend the Instant C# and Instant VB products from Tangible for people who choose to be mono-lingual. These conversion tools do a really good job (not perfect, but <EM>really</EM> good) of converting projects, files or bits of code between the languages. </P>
<P>CSLA couldn't exist in both languages without these tools (because even though I'm multi-lingual, I surely don't have the time to write everything twice!)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
