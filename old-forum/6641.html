This way you do not need to mess with nullable values that usually is a pain.<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: xAvailx [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Thursday, March 19, 2009 4:23 PM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: [CSLA .NET] ComboBox Databinding and Nulls<br /><br />CSLA 3.6 / WinForms / Databinding (sigh)<br /><br />I am sure this has been discussed a thousand times but I can't find any relevant posts. <br /><br />I have a combobox that should allow an "empty/null" selection.

See my post on the second page of this old thread <A HREF="/forums/thread/4676.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/4676.aspx</A></P>
<P>I too give the fake item an id of 0 or Guid.Empty to avoid messing with nulls.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
