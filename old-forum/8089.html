<P>Originally GetManager() just took the connection string. But it was later changed to take the database name and it looks up the connection string (by default). You have to pass false for the second parameter if you want it to use the parameter as a connection string directly.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Nemisis replied on Friday, December 04, 2009</h2>Rocky,<br>Sorry if i am sounding stupid, but we used to pass in the name of the connectionstring, not the database name, is this what you mean?&nbsp; My connectionstrings are kept in my web.config.<br><br>Example<br>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br>&lt;add name="devstring" connectstring="..." /&gt;<br>&lt;/connectionstrings&gt;<br><br>I want to pass in the word "devstring" such as<br>.GetManager("devstring")....<br><br>Do i need to pass in the extra parameter still?<br><br>Also i dont know why this is happening on one server and not the other, both are running windows server 2003.&nbsp; My laptop doesnt produce the error and i am running Windows 7 with VS 2008.<br><br>I did notice that 3.8.0 needs mvc, should i install that on the servers as well?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, December 04, 2009</h2><P>Then I don't have any idea, sorry...</P>
<P>No, you don't need to install MVC anywhere except your dev workstation. And 3.8.1 eliminates that requirement as well (which is the only reason 3.8.1 exists actually).</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
