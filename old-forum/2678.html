But you could use VS and turn on all the verbosity for building, and I think they then output the csc calls in the output window. You could copy-paste from there to get them.</P>
<P>Another option may be to use msbuild rather than calling csc directly. msbuild reads sln and csproj files, and uses that information to invoke the compiler - so you get command-line behavior without having to do all the work yourself.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
