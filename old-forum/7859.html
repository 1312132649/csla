<P>Assuming you are using 3.8 Beta 2 (which isn't out yet - but let's say you've pulled the current code out of svn):</P>
<OL>
<LI>Reference System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</LI>
<LI>Add a 'using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;' to your business class</LI>
<LI>Declare your property like normal, but decorate the property with one of the new validation attributes, such as Required or Range.</LI>
<LI>Then <EM>either</EM>:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>Don't override AddBusinessRules() at all - the base implementation will add the attribute rules, or</LI>
<LI>Add a call to 'base.AddBusinessRules();' in your AddBusinessRules() override - so the base implementation can add the attribute rules</LI></OL></OL>
<P>That's all there is to it.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>saeedsamie replied on Friday, October 23, 2009</h2>Hi Rocky,<br><br>I checked exactly the same as you specified but it doesn't work with windowsform and no error shown by errorprovider like when using validation commonrules .

That concept didn't exist<br />a few months ago.<br /><br />If you want to use validation attributes you should download CSLA .NET 3.8<br />Beta 2 (just released), which supports this concept.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
