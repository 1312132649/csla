<p>Few questions around code navigation:</p>
<p>Main Question: </p>
<p>How can I find all references to dataportal update for a particular class which inherits from BusinessBase?</p>
<p>My ideas so far </p>
<p>Is dataportal_update only called from Base.Save() ?</p>
<p>Is there any way to find the code which calls Save for the derrived class only? (FindReferences finds all implementations of BusinessBase)</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>That might be quite challenging, because any code can interact with the data portal to call DataPortal.Update&lt;T&gt;. _Normally_ this is done by calling Save on an editable root object, but there&#39;s nothing that enforces that convention.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>seanPower replied on Wednesday, August 06, 2014</h2><p>Thanks for the response. I&#39;m just trying to look at the impact of a change made at sql stored proc level. Its only used by one business object (businessbase) in the dp_update but that object is referenced by many others. I only seem to be able to find references to the object itself (120 references) or to ALL of the save methods (as its implemented by base class i am unable to find only for this implementation - 300 references).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems a rather large limitation if i am unable to look at the impact of my change... hopefully its just me not explaining it correctly</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2014</h2><p>You should be able to profile the stored procedure before your changes and after; the fact that you&#39;re using Csla to call it doesn&#39;t really matter.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding the scope of your change though.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
