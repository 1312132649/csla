as open source, providing a download from my website. This project uses the
csla library, of course, which is contained in my VS solution. I was wondering
if there would be a problem with me including the csla source library along
with my project.

<P>I don't recommend including the source however, because it will very likely lead to confusion over time (due to the way search engines index these things). Instead, I recommend you reference <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet">www.lhotka.net/cslanet</A> or <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx</A> and specify the version against which you know your code will run.</P>
<P>So the license doesn't preclude you from including the source (with the noted constraints), but there are some very good reasons why it is a terrible, terrible idea, and so I request that you avoid including the source.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DaseinFiasco replied on Sunday, August 05, 2007</h2>Understood, and thanks. I'll link to the official download page then.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
