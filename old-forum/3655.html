I need to do checks as the page loads to verify that the user has rights to it.&nbsp;For instance, a user would need to be in role=’Admin’ to get access to ‘siteAdmin.aspx’ while a user would need to be in role=’User’ or role=’Admin’&nbsp;to get&nbsp;rights to default.aspx.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>Seems like there are a few options including:</FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI>
<DIV class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>ASP.Net’s web.config file - seems like a nightmare to maintain page and folder names with roles. FIles and folder can easily get moved or renamed.</FONT></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>Put calls to User.IsInRole(“roleName1”) || User.IsInRole(“roleName2”) in&nbsp;each individual&nbsp;page load or init.</FONT></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>Have a property in a base class that all my pages would inherit from that would set the roles for the page and then have the base page handle the logic to redirect unauthorized users.</FONT></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>Call CanGetObject() on a CSLA business object. Which would mean I need to implement this on all business object when I probably wouldn’t need it for any other reasons.</FONT></DIV></LI></OL>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>The final option seems the cleanest since I don’t have to have authorization rules in the pages and can rely on CSLA but that also means I need a CSLA business object to base each page on although I guess more than likely I would otherwise what would I need authorization for.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri>Just wondering what other people are doing. Thanks for the help.</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Saturday, October 06, 2007</h2><P>I use #2 above. I put it at the top of each page that requires authorization. Some do not require any so I just omit it. Pretty simple - but it works.</P>
