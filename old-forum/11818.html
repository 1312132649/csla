We bind directly to the bo.<br /><br />I cannot mark the BO as busy overriding the SaveAsync method since the base doesn&#39;t allow a busy object to be saved. In the OnSaved method the BO is marked Idle.</p>
<p><br />This feels like a new bug in csla 4.5</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, February 05, 2013</h2><p>Could be a bug. I haven&#39;t notice this behavior, but as I&#39;m working on the data portal right now I&#39;ll see if I can repro the issue.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Thursday, February 07, 2013</h2><p>It seems that it will be fixed in CSLA 4.5.20, thanks. Just once small detail; it seems that MarkIdle is called twice now, one time in the finally and one time in the OnSaved.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 07, 2013</h2><p>Thanks for testing - I&#39;ll fix that.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
