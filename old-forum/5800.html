<P>I started with the MyPrincipal.cs and MyIdentity.cs files from the membership test app. I then added&nbsp;a BeginLogin method to MyPrincipal to handle the login asynchronously. I've also added the necessary #if SILVERLIGHT conditionals. The code builds fine, but when I try to log in, I get an exception: "No parameterless constructor defined for this object."</P>
<P>I've tried adding public&nbsp;parameterless constructors to both MyPrincipal and MyIdentity, but that doesn't help.</P>
<P>Has this been tested/used with Silverlight? If not, will it work? I suppose I could always implement a custom command based on CommandBase and do the work on the server rather than trying to use the objects from the client.</P>

<P>There's a simpler test for WPF in the Samples\CslaNet folder too. It is simpler because it was written after we changed MembershipIdentity to not be abstract - so it just creates an instance of MembershipIdentity directly.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
