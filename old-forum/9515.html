<p>This is done using standard CSLA data access. Set up a remote data portal on the server and use one of the four data access models described in the data FAQ (<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/DataFaq.ashx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/DataFaq.ashx</a>) to contain your data access code.</p>
<p>The use of a remote data portal is described in <i>Expert 2008 Business Objects</i>, the <i>Core 3.8</i> video series and the <i>CSLA .NET for Silverlight</i> video series. The four data access models are described in <i>Expert 2008 Business Objects</i> and the <i>Core 3.8</i> video series. Data access is also demonstrated in the Silverlight video series, but not quite in as much detail as the other two sources.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ddredstar replied on Tuesday, September 14, 2010</h2><p>maybe i should ask how csla light access database?</p>

<p>As much as Rocky puts a lot of effort into answering questions on the forum, his time is valuable.</p>
<p>You&nbsp;really should buy his book, which explains how CSLA works, or purchase one of the video series.</p>
<p>But, if you don&#39;t want to do that, there are other samples which do actually access a real database.</p>
<p>Cheers and good luck!</p>
