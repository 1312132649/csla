"foo") was contained in it.&nbsp; Regular expression can handle this with <br><br>(?!foo)<br><br>which will return with a null result for each character.<br><br>Here is the bug/problem: in CommonRules.RegExRuleArgs there is a parameter enum which is called "NullResultOptions" which has the options convert, true, false.&nbsp; <br><br>I would have <u>expected</u> this to apply to the <u>result</u> of the regular expression matching, so I could say, "if the result is null, return false", but this instead applies to the <u>value</u> of the target. It does not apply to the <u>result</u> at all!<br><br>What should change:<br><ul><li>NullResultOptions&nbsp; should be changed to Null<u>Value</u>Options as it is clearly the wrong name.</li><li>Could you implement an actual NullResultOption that would do what it's name says and will let you specify whether a match that is null will return True or False.</li></ul>thanks<br><br>Dan<br><div class="" id="PageScrollMarkerWedJul222009110402GMT0400EasternDaylightTime"><div></div><div></div></div><div id="divCleekiAttrib"></div></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, July 22, 2009</h2><P>FYI - I do not use the CommonRules at all. </P>
<P>I copied them to my own library a long time ago and then tweaked them to meet my requirements. I suggest that you do something similar for some or all of these rules - especially the regex rule. Rocky only included them in CSLA as sample rules for "simple cases" that can be re-used across BOs. The goal is for each user to develop their own library of rules to meet their own requirements.</P>

If you like the rule implementations in CommonRules you should feel free to use them. If you don't like the implementations in CommonRules you should feel free to create your own library of rule methods.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
