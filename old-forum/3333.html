Can anybody help me to find out if this is what is causing the <BR>problem and if so how I can get around it? <BR><BR>Even just helping me to find a way of debugging the dll would be useful (I <BR>currently need to build the application then click on the icon that appears <BR>in the Other section of My Computer to run the compiled version and see my <BR>changes running). </P>
<P>Any help greatly appreciated!</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
