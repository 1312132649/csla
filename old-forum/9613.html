Great, thank you. And went looking for DeepData example in the 4.0.1 sources without success. After a brainwave, I looked in the 3.8 sources with success.<br /><br />Is it missing from 4.0.1 by accident, or are its technique deprecated?<br />If intentionally missing, a DeepData directory with a readme saying so and where it is available, would have been very helpful. </p>
<p>thanks<br />John</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, October 07, 2010</h2><p>I went through the samples in the CSLA 4 release and removed any that we hadn&#39;t had time to update, and that included DeepData. I am not sure a readme would have been terribly helpful since it would just say that the last time DeepData had been updated was perhaps 2 years ago, and that if you want to actually run it you probably have to go back to CSLA .NET 3.0.5 or something.</p>
<p>The <i>Core 3.8</i> video series includes targeted demos, including the use of the two data access methods I generally recommend (DataPortal_XZY invoking a DAL via repository pattern, or implementing the DAL in an object factory), using EF with DTOs/entities for data transfer to the objects.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
