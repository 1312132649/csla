<p>1: I plan to have all access to the database server be handled on web server (using the Business.Server project).&nbsp; I&#39;d like to put my Connection String (password, etc) someplace that does NOT get downloaded to the client.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would I place the Connection String in the .Web application (static property) or in Business.Server - suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the code in Business.Server get compiled and packaged into the .xap file?</p>
<p>2: I don&#39;t care to install CSLA or BFX onto my local machine for development because these projects can get handled by several developers through subversion&nbsp;and I don&#39;t want them to worry about installing CSLA and BXF on their machines to get a project to work (In fact, I get a little irritated that demos don&#39;t work without doing this when the compiled DLLs should be included in the demo).&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I create a separate project named Framework and include a CSLAClient folder, CSLAServer folder, and BFX folder and place release .DLLS there and reference them from there as required?&nbsp; Suggestions?</p>
<p>So far it all looks good.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mehgerbil replied on Tuesday, November 16, 2010</h2><p>I see now that only the Business.Client library goes down to the Client so connection strings would be safe in Business.Server, which is where I&#39;d use them anyways.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#39;s a win.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the .DLLs I&#39;m placing them in the respective .Client and .Server projects.</p>
<p>This stuff is very bizarre but interesting.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
