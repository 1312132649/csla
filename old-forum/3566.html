When I move to another row then the current row gets validated. However: if that next row has previously been selected, then it does not cause the the last row to be validated. Is this a bug in drv that has a workaround?</P>
<P>I tried doing a main control.validate in the leave row event, but it does not cause the row to validate.. I also tried saving the datatouce.current to manually save the object, but the changes are not reflected in the datasource.</P>
<P>Is there some way to get around this problem or is it best just to go back to&nbsp; a businessListBase to get better control.</P>
