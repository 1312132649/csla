<P>I rigged up some code before to allow a local DB, then used remoting in my BO's to build a sync routine, but it was very ugly.</P>
<P>I've been researching SQL 2005 Replication, which looks promising.</P>
<P>I've never touched Enterprise Library... looks a little daunting.</P>
<P>Anyone solved this already?</P>

<P>I'm in the same situation and got good testresults with "SQL Server 2005 Everywhere"&nbsp; (CTP released last Monday : <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=85E0C3CE-3FA1-453A-8CE9-AF6CA20946C3&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=85E0C3CE-3FA1-453A-8CE9-AF6CA20946C3&amp;displaylang=en</A>&nbsp;) on the client (desktop in my case).&nbsp; Then I use merge-replication to get the data synchronised with a SQL Server 2005 database on the server.</P>
<P>Regards,</P>

<P>I just saw another thread (<A HREF="/forums/thread/263.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/263.aspx</A>) in here talking about the issue.&nbsp; Any reason (since my client is OK with it) not to use SQL Express?</P>
<P>I need to use stored procedure... mostly because there are about 100 already written.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>The advantage of SQL Express is indeed the support for stored procedures.&nbsp; On the other hand the SQL Express 2005 SP1 installer is about 55MB large, so if you need to deploy that over gprs/umts, it might be a bit large.&nbsp; And of course there are the RAM requirements 192MB minimum, and 512MB recommended.&nbsp; As it installs as a service, you absolutely need admin rights, while for the "Everywhere version" (although not recommended by MS) you could deploy the dll's directly in the application directory with clickonce, and that works even for a "limited user".</P>
<P>If you prefer something easy and lightweight, I think SQL Server 2005 Everywhere is the way to go.</P>

<P>I'm not so concerned about the install size in my case, but I do hate the fact that SQL Express will always run.&nbsp; I may look at a means of starting and stopping it with my app.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jan replied on Thursday, June 15, 2006</h2><P>Kevin,</P>
<P>Don't worry,&nbsp;no special relationship with Microsoft.&nbsp; I'm only an&nbsp;independent&nbsp;programmer with the typical love/hate relationship towards Microsoft.&nbsp; Love because they have nice products; hate because too often missing or&nbsp;not working features in their products&nbsp;give me the impression&nbsp;they (Microsoft)&nbsp;don't really&nbsp;use their own products.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>&nbsp;"I do hate the fact that SQL Express will always run"</EM></P>
<P>It looks like you just gave&nbsp;another reason to use "SQL Server Everywhere"&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)</P>
