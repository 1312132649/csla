In the C# version the same variables are being defined as var, which doesn't mean anything. How can this be fixed?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>webjedi replied on Tuesday, March 25, 2008</h2><P>In C# var is used for an anonymous type...which definately has meaning and is on purpose.</P>
<P>Make sure you are trying to build with VS2008 and don't change the targeted framework from .Net 3.5 to anything else.</P>

<P>If you are using .NET 2.0 or 3.0 then you should be using CSLA .NET 3.0.x.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>AKaplan replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2><P>I am using .net 3.5</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2><P>The feature is called type inference. In C# it is like</P>
<P>var x&nbsp;= 10;</P>
<P>and in VB it is like</P>
<P>Dim x = 10</P>
<P>In both cases 'x' ends up being of type int/Integer.</P>
<P>In VB you can turn this feature on/off using an Option statement at the top of each file, or at the project level. The Csla project should have inference turned on - but perhaps somehow it is not turned on for you?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>AKaplan replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2>thanks rockford. i know this was a simple thing to explain, but it was something i needed to understand, and it wasn't being done in the previous versions of csla</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>AKaplan replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2>my Option statements are turned on at the project level. I'm not sure which Option you are referring to, but Option Explicit = On, Option Strict = On, Option Compare = binary</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2><P>In VS 2008 check</P>
<P>Tools</P>
<P>Options</P>
<P>Projects And Solutions</P>
<P>VB Defaults</P>
<P>Option Infer - set it to On.</P>

I have VS2005 which does not have Option Infer.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2>Well Csla 3.5 requires Vs2008 / .Net 3.5... so you should look at 3.0.3.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2>
