<p>I&#39;ve seem to be calling a command on a child BO, so I wrap it in a call from my parent BO, which in turn has a call back so that my UI ViewModel knows it is done, which in turn might be a child of another ViewModel.</p>
<p>Some of it needs refactoring know that I have a better handle on MVVM but I would really like to try and stop replicating all these function calls in all my layers.</p>
<p>At the end of the day I need my VM to know that an error occurred so I can display something pretty for the users and deal with the issue.</p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering if something like DoRefresh() -&gt; OnRefreshed()&nbsp; but DoExecute() -&gt; OnExecuted();</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m missing the point that this can also be handled another way...</p>

<p>It would just make for a simple and clear implemenation with a single spot to code for errors/returns from the UI perspective and leaves the BO layer to not have to worry about doing extra legwork so the UI can also find out what happened.</p>
