CanWriteProperty = !this.ReadOnly)? It is possible to check that in property setter and throw exception there, but it would be nice if ReadWriteAuthorization class could check that also and make GUI control enabled/disabled.<br><br>Any workarounds?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 28, 2006</h2>The CanReadProperty() and CanWriteProperty() methods can be overridden, allowing you to customize behavior if needed.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>burmajam replied on Thursday, June 29, 2006</h2>Tnx Rocky for the reply.<br><br>One more question. Should I place also attribute like this?<br><br>[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Advanced)]<br>public override bool CanWriteProperty(string propertyName)<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 29, 2006</h2>




<DIV align=left><SPAN class=776122015-29062006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>Probably. I guess it depends on whether you want the method 
to appear in most cases. Honestly, in C#, this attribute is almost useless 
because most people have VS set to show advanced members... But it is a best 
practice, because VB has a more sophisticated way of showing advanced members in 
intellisense, and you never know what the C# team might do in the future as 
well.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
