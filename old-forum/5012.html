<P>Can anyone tell me which version of CSLA.NET this book is covering? Is it 2.0?</P>
<P>Is this the best place to start when looking at CSLA?</P>
<P>TIA</P>

The "Version 2.1 handbook" expands a bit from where "C# Business Objects 2005" stops and covers some of the enhancements and finally the "Version 3.0" book covers the .Net 3.0 features used by CSLA (as well as some other enhancements).<BR>"C# Business Objects 2005" is probably still the best place to start but keep an eye on the release notes for the 3.x versions of CSLA as certain important fixes/enhancements have been made.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Devman replied on Tuesday, June 24, 2008</h2><P>Thanks for the reply triplea</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
