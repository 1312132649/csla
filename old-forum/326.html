<P>Tracing on the database showed that no SQL activity or connections were happening, so looked like the DataPortal was the problem.&nbsp; Stopped and restarted IIS6, and restarted our clients but still problem existed.&nbsp; Did then restart SQL for good measure but no fix.</P>
<P>Had to restart the whole server and then things were fine.&nbsp; Yes its the "if in doubt switch off then on again trick."</P>
<P>Anyone else every had this behaviour?</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, June 09, 2006</h2>It sounds like an IIS problem.&nbsp; Have you checked the Event log and the w3srv log file?<br><br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
