<P>I am starting the re-engineering of a MS Access application (front end) and SQL Server 2005 (back end) and am utilizing CSLA.&nbsp; Now, the company that acquired us has an AS/400 (or as I refer to it as an ASS/400 or POS/400 for piece of s$%t) and they are in the dark ages of technology.&nbsp; I think the AS/400 came out in the early to mid 80's.&nbsp; Anyway, I am utilzing CSLA and am developing my business objects and will be utilizing Windows and Web forms (WPF is not mature enough yet and I don't have time to learn all the intracies of it to have it change).&nbsp; I believe in CSLA as I have developed a number of VB6 apps utilizing it and have been utilizing it for years for other apps.&nbsp; When WPF matures, I will be able to create the front end utilizing it and all the business objects will be able to be used.</P>
<P>So, if anyone has a PowerPoint Presentation that they had to use to present to management the advantages of CSLA, could you email me at <A href="mailto:ksafford@guttmanoil.com">ksafford@guttmanoil.com</A> and let me check out the presentation.</P>
<P>Thank you in advance,</P>

<P>How many of the programmers actually doing the work agree that CSLA is the way to go?</P>
<P>Because if they all agree on using CSLA, don't give a presentation to management until AFTER the project is over.</P>
<P>Otherwise you are asking technically incompetent people to make&nbsp;this technical decision :</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>"Can we use CSLA?"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Asking technically incompetent people to make technical decisions is - well - to put it bluntly - asking for an incompetent answer.</P>
<P>When choosing whether to&nbsp;use CSLA, here are the questions to ask:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
<P>"Is this the best way, the least expensive way, and the fastest way&nbsp;I know how to build the product, at the desired level of quality within the desired timeframe?"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>If the answer is yes, never, ever, ask non-technical management unless they have to write a check to make it happen.</P>
<P>If the answer is Yes for some of the categories, but not all, the question to ask management is this:</P>
<P>Please rank these in "Most Important" order: </P>
<UL>
<LI>best way</LI>
<LI>least expensive way</LI>
<LI>fastest way.</LI></UL>
<P>If your technical assessment of using CSLA matches their priorities, use CSLA. If it doesn't use the best way you know how.</P>
