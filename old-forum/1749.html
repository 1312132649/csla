This top level BO will be responsible for fetching the others (during the New contructor or else DP_Create or Lazy loading.) </P>
<P>In a recent thread it was discussed as to the best way to move data from one BO to another. Most of us prefer to create a new BO of the correct type and then pass in the "other" BO to a CopyData method which reads the values from the old BO and puts them into the new BO. This method gives you the ability to omit certain fields (GUIDs, etc.).</P>
<P>So I can see your top level BO having such a method.</P>
<P>Then when you want to move data from one to the other you call the CopyData method and pass in the original BO. If you want to delete the data in the original location you can do that in another method call if you want.</P>
<P>Anyway - that is the general idea.</P>
