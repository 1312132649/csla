<P>Does anyone know why the 'Configure Data Source' choice would not be visible in a CSLADatasource object when dragged onto a webform?</P>
<P>I do get CslaDataSource Tasks and Refresh Schema choices.</P>
<P>When I open up the Projecttracker application web forms and look at csladatasource the choice is there, but in my own project they are not.</P>
<P>I am using CSLA 3.0,have the library I have created of classes with appropriate references and namespaces representing ones found in project tracker, and the csladatasource drag and drop tool was added to the tools. So i think I have done most of the things necessary to have a fully configurable CSLADatasource.</P>
<P>Thoughts ? ( and please forgive if this has been answered before- i did try a keyword search)</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, August 13, 2007</h2><P>You can check the ebook and Rocky's blog posts.</P>
<P>I believe that dragging the CSLADataSource onto the designer is not allowed. It is a known issue that is unresolvable since MS controls the designer code. I think if you use markup or some other technique you can then fully use the CSLADataSource. You just can't drag it from the toolbox.</P>
