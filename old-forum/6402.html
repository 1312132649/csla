<P>Also, at the bottom of the <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx</A> page I put&nbsp;a link to the latest VB code. This code doesn't work, but it does build. The team working on the VB effort is making amazing strides forward (especially Sean and Von).</P>
<P>The version 3.6.2 release will include a number of bug fixes, and a number of new features or enhancements. Some of the really cool stuff includes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Lambda-based RegisterProperty() that is simpler and avoids all string literals</LI>
<LI>Saved event on CslaDataProvider</LI>
<LI>New ErrorDialog control for Silverlight and WPF to further reduce the need for code-behind</LI>
<LI>Some sorting enhancements to LINQ to CSLA</LI>
<LI>A MobileDictionary type&nbsp;so you can create dictionaries that serialize to/from Silverlight</LI>
<LI>New methods in ObjectFactory to make it easier to write a complete DAL</LI></UL>
<P>The change logs have more information.</P>
<P>I am particularly interested in feedback on the ErrorDialog controls. They are implemented slightly different in Silverlight from WPF. This is partially due to differences in SL and WPF, and partially because I'm not entirely sure I have the design right.</P>
<P>There's also an issue in WPF, because WPF seems to invoke a data provider twice when it gets an exception. That seems bad, and I can't see where it is my code causing it. Worse, I can't entirely see how to prevent it (how do you know that the second call is actually a duplicate?). Kind of ugly.</P>
<P>In any case, if you get a chance to give 3.6.2 a try (either because I addressed one of your bugs/issues, or because the new features look nice), let me know what you think.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Thursday, February 12, 2009</h2>GetDeletedList and the FieldExists methods in the ObjectFactory just made my own changes in our framework layer obsolete :)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 12, 2009</h2>Yea! :)<br /><br />Hopefully we're narrowing down the list of helper methods necessary to<br />create a full DAL in an ObjectFactory subclass.<br /><br />Rocky<br /><br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: rfcdejong [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Thursday, February 12, 2009 2:58 PM<br />To: rocky@lhotka.net<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] CSLA .NET 3.6.2 preview<br /><br />GetDeletedList and the FieldExists methods in the ObjectFactory just made my<br />own changes in our framework layer obsolete :)<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, February 13, 2009</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/basicblue/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>There's also an issue in WPF, because WPF seems to invoke a data provider twice when it gets an exception.
