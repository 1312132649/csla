(This would be done in the InsertItem method override).<br><br>Thanks for any suggestions<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, October 06, 2006</h2>No one has any ideas?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rhoeting replied on Friday, October 06, 2006</h2>So this is a question of "where to put logic" as opposed to "how to write the logic", correct?<br><br>Rob<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, October 09, 2006</h2>Yes.&nbsp; Also, if this is even a good idea to begin with.&nbsp; Maybe the UI should remove the items itself?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rhoeting replied on Monday, October 09, 2006</h2><P>Not sure if this will help you, but whenever I come across these "where to put BL" questions, I pretend I will need to&nbsp;the logic&nbsp;to&nbsp;work in other&nbsp;contexts, such as batch, web service, or web:&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I had to&nbsp;write a batch&nbsp;routine to automate this functionality&nbsp;down the road,&nbsp;where does the BL&nbsp;placement make&nbsp;the most sense?" </P>
<P>Doing this helps understand the true essence of the problem I'm trying to solve, or if the problem even makes sense.&nbsp; Again, this may not help your for this particular problem...</P>
