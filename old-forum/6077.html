<P>Strange issue when trying to save a BusinessBase object after editing.&nbsp; When I change something in the object and click 'Ok' (go through the save process), I get this error:</P>
<P>Csla.Validation.ValidationException: Object is still being edited and can not be saved</P>
<P>The only thing I have done is migrate to 3.6.0 from 3.0.1.&nbsp; Is there some upgrade process that I need to go through?&nbsp; Or a list of breaking changes that I need to consider or something else?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

(It may be that a fix to CSLA is exposing a problem with the way you are doing this than a breaking change per se)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jkellywilkerson replied on Sunday, January 04, 2009</h2><P>Not sure I follow you.&nbsp; I have coded the application to operate similar to the ProjectTracker demo app and everything has been working for a year or more.&nbsp; I do not need the WPF or WCF stuff; so I may just switch back to the 3.0.1 version unless there is something that I am missing in this new version that I can change rather quickly.&nbsp; I just don't want to go through 30 or 40 WinForms to make changes to a process that has been working with previous editions.</P>
<P>But, if that is the issue, and I need to utilize some of the new stuff, I guess I will have no other alternative.</P>
<P>Thanks for input,</P>

The old incorrect behavior is now switched to the new behavior and is exposing bugs in your code. Your code "used to work" because you didn't realize there were bugs in it and Csla didn't point them out for you. Now it does.</P>
<P>The book mentions it on page 214 and this forum has discussed it many times. </P>
<P>Here is one thread that discusses CslaAutoCloneOnUpdate.<BR><A HREF="/forums/thread/20938.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/20938.aspx</A></P>
