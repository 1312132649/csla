<P>I'm having some issues with using an AJAX Update Panel in a Formview.&nbsp; I'm trying to place an Update Panel for a few dropdownlists in my formview while in edit mode.&nbsp; Basically I can get the update panel to work, do some postbacks and all, but it won't bind to the csladatasource to update the database.&nbsp; Basically I want to use the update panel to enable and disable some controls based on what the user enters.&nbsp; I'm also using some validation controls with it too.&nbsp; I've got the ScriptManger in there and everything.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I did try placeing the entire formview in the update panel, and it updates, but whenever you press save, the validation controls don't apear.</P>
<P>Also, I've tried using the WebAsyncRefreshPanel from Infragistics, its saves to the database, but whenever I click on a dropdownlist that I have doing a postback it does a full postback and reloads the entire page.&nbsp; I'm trying to get the functionality of this as clean as possible and it show all of the validation.&nbsp; I've been at this for a while, if anyone has any tips for this, it would be awesome!&nbsp; Thanks in advance and have an AWESOME&nbsp;4th of July!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jordan replied on Friday, July 06, 2007</h2><P>Well, we were able to figure out how to get around this.&nbsp; So, when Microsoft release AJAX, all of the microsoft asp.net validator controls are not compatible at all.&nbsp; To get around this, we found this resource, and it works!</P><FONT color=#0000ff size=1>

<P><FONT color=#000000 size=3>So, if you are working with AJAX and validation, this will help!&nbsp; Microsoft will send an update eventually to fix this issue.&nbsp; In the mean time, here is a temporary solution.&nbsp; I hope this helps any of web programmers!&nbsp; Oh yeah, and you will want to put the entire formview in the UpdatePanel, if you are using that.&nbsp; Have a great Friday!&nbsp; :D</FONT></P></FONT></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
