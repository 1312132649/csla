<P>The first thing I'm thinking is this would be great for csla code generation, much better then using the delegate methods method for partial classes.&nbsp; Also works in VB9.</P>

<P>Your thoughts anybody?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Friday, December 07, 2007</h2>One more thing, these methods are actually compiler tricks used with VS2008, so they can be used in .net 2.0 projects as well.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
