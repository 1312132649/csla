<P>I have converted from the earlier CSLA version to the latest 2.1 and the biggest difference I found was in the validation stuff.&nbsp; Once you understand it the conversion is not too bad.&nbsp; I can give you a couple code snippets of validation stuff if you like as a reference.&nbsp; But I suppose it could be different for you depending on how you have written your business classes.&nbsp; My validation code is pretty straight forward.&nbsp; I am not using any of the warning features.&nbsp; </P>

If you want it then let me have an email address and I will forward it.</P>

<P>One tip:</P>
<P>Add a reference to a new .dll named System.Configuration.dll before trying to change a warning about ConfigurationManager. MS deprecated the namespace in System.dll related to Configuration and created a new .dll but never told anyone to reference it first.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mtagliaf replied on Wednesday, November 01, 2006</h2>thanks, I'll take it.
