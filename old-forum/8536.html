The problem I am having is that I am passing the binding source to the user controls which in-turn has binding sources. When I save I then get the infamous edit level mis-match.</p>
<p>So my question is should I eliminate the child binding sources and bind the information another way? </p>
<p>If I should continue to use the child binding sources then how do I tell each part to stop what they are doing so the parent binding source can save the business object?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, February 16, 2010</h2><p>This is how I handled it.</p>
<p>The user control has a bindingsource, which is setup more or less as a normal child bindingsource would be.&nbsp; I then have various methods to do the databinding correctly.&nbsp; A SetBindingSource sets the control&#39;s bindingsource.datasource to the root bindingsource, and the DataMember to the appropriate member of the BO.</p>
<p>The I have other methods / properties, like bool RaiseListChangedEvents, ResetBindings, EndEdit.&nbsp; I creating these, which pass the call along to the control&#39;s bindingsource so that you can do the normal steps to avoid binding issues.&nbsp; </p>
