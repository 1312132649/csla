I do not even use a CommandBase object for it. Just a class with some Shared methods.<br /><br />For SQL Server logging I use a Root BO not a Command Object. I also display log results on screen if the Admin user wants to see them so I need to beable to fetch as well as "just log".<br /><br />Joe</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, March 24, 2009</h2>Well, the command base is just to get across the data portal.&nbsp; <br><br>I'll have BOs on an admin website that will read the logs as well.. so glad to know I'm on the right track.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
