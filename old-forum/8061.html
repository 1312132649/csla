<P>The <EM><A href="http://store.lhotka.net/"><STRONG>Core CSLA .NET 3.8 Video Series</STRONG></A></EM> provides nearly 9 hours of high quality training content to build your skills around CSLA .NET - for any type of user interface. The focus of this series is not on user interface development, it is on the core concepts of CSLA .NET – the knowledge you need to build a solid business layer for any application. </P>
<P>This six part series provides an introduction to CSLA .NET, then dives into detail to show how to code each type of business object, including business, validation and authorization rules. You’ll also learn about the various options for implementing data access, and how to effectively utilize the data portal for 1-, 2- and 3-tier deployments of your applications.</P>
<P><STRONG>I’m offering a special “pre-release” sale price of 33% off on the video series. <A href="http://store.lhotka.net/">Buy now</A> with this heavy discount, and get each new video segment as they become available. Segments 1 and 2 are online now!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Act now, the discount will phase out as the entire series comes online!!</STRONG></P>
<P>Here is a summary of the video segments:</P>
<P><STRONG>Introduction <BR></STRONG>In this video you will become familiar with the CSLA .NET framework's vision, goals and overall scope. You will be introduced to the various architectures supported by CSLA .NET, and the requirements necessary to build CSLA .NET applications.</P>
<P><STRONG>Business Object Types <BR></STRONG>In this video you will learn how to implement each of the business object stereotypes supported by CSLA .NET. These include editable objects, lists of objects, read-only objects, read-only lists, name/value lists, command objects and more. At the end of this video you will understand the purpose behind each stereotype, and the coding structure to use when building business objects for each stereotype.</P>
<P><STRONG>Data Access</STRONG> <BR>This video details the various options supported by CSLA .NET for data access. You will learn how to put data access code into your business class, or into a separate data access assembly using a repository pattern, along with the pros and cons of each technique. You will also learn about the ObjectFactory attribute and base class, that can be used to create pluggable data access layers for an application.</P>
<P><STRONG>Data Portal</STRONG> <BR>In this video you will learn how to build 1-, 2- and 3-tier applications using CSLA .NET. CSLA .NET allows your UI, business object and data access code to remain the same in all these configurations, but there are numerous configuration options and choices you can make to optimize how your application works in each of these scenarios.</P>
<P><STRONG>Business and Validation Rules <BR></STRONG>In this video you will learn how to implement business and validation rules in your business objects. This includes the use of validation attributes, common validation rules and custom business and validation rules. You will also learn how to implement and use synchronous and asynchronous business rules in your applications.</P>
<P><STRONG>Authentication and Authorization <BR></STRONG>In this video you will learn about the various authentication and authorization techniques supported by CSLA .NET. Authentication options include Windows, ASP.NET Membership Provider and custom authentication. The CSLA .NET authorization subsystem supports per-property and per-type authorization, which is role-based by default, and can be customized.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Monday, November 30, 2009</h2>Hi Rocky.<br /><br />This is great news, I am really stoked about this. I think this is really going to help new developers get on board with the CSLA framework a lot faster. I hope the book takes the same direction. Thank you!<br /><br />I purchased the Silverlight video series and I will purchase these videos too no matter what if anything because this is my own little way to contribute to the development of the CSLA framework however, I have one small questions.<br /><br />How much overlap would I expect to see between the “Core CSLA .NET 3.8 Video Series” and the “CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series”. Would I need to skip any videos if I already watch the Siverlight videos?<br /><br />By the way, although I purchased the Silverlight videos a long time ago, I just started watching them this weekend (I just finished the second video and poked around the others). So far, I really like them.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, December 01, 2009</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>rxelizondo:</strong></div><div>How much overlap would I expect to see between the “Core CSLA .NET 3.8 Video Series” and the “CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series”.

<P>Introduction: There's some overlap around the history of the framework, etc. But the setup of a solution for .NET is different from Silverlight, and I think I talked about downloading/building the framework differently this time.</P>
<P>Object types: This video is pretty similar - it should be, because the various stereotypes should work 99% the same on any platform :)</P>
<P>Data access: I reworked the approach for the Core series, adding the use of a repository patttern in DataPortal_XYZ methods, which is my personal favorite approach.</P>
<P>Data portal: This is quite different since this is the .NET data portal, not the SL data portal.</P>
<P>Business/validation rules: This is a new video and is more in-depth around the rules than the SL series.</P>
<P>Authn/Authz: This is a new video and covers .NET techniques for authn, which are different from the SL techniques. The authz stuff is obviously the same, since there's parity between .NET and SL.</P>
<P>The thing is, in the SL videos most segments take time to talk about the UI aspects of the feature. In this Core series there's little or no UI discussion at all, so I have more time to focus on the business layer aspects of each feature and I can go a little more in-depth. I think this is a better way of breaking out the content - I hope so anyway :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, December 04, 2009</h2><P>Segment 3 just went online.</P>

The business object types video is<br />pretty similar, but the rest of the videos are pretty different. This is not<br />an upgrade or replacement for the Silverlight series - I think they are<br />complimentary.<br /><br />I do hope to find time to upgrade the samples for the SL videos to 3.8. I<br />think that's a generous effort on my part, but since it isn't difficult I do<br />hope to do it.<br /><br />Rocky <br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: mbblum [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Monday, November 30, 2009 8:00 PM<br />To: rocky@lhotka.net<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] Core CSLA .NET 3.8 Video Series "pre-release" sale<br /><br />Sorry, have to ask.
