to grand-children etc in the current DataPortal,&nbsp; the FieldManager only gets the current children and
calls ChildDataPortal.Update. Does the BO developer have to manually call
FieldManager.UpdateChildren() on the child object's Child_Update to
update grandchildren?&nbsp; I thought this was automatic using FieldManager.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, October 01, 2009</h2>Hi, <br><br>The BO developer will have to call FieldManager.UpdateChildren in the child objects Child_Update because you may want to send additional/different parameters to the child_Update method. <br><br>For each level you have dynamic methods called (dynamic in terms of parameters) - and we use that a lot. Imagine for example sending Parent from the previous level into the Child_Insert or Child_Update method (and not the list - which is the child objects parent) . <br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Kevin Fairclough replied on Friday, October 02, 2009</h2>Thanks JonnyBee<br><br>This Parent thing is confusing me a little I think because of the lists,&nbsp; the real parent of the object is not the list.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
