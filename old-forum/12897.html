<p>GitHub isn&#39;t really _designed_ to be a forum, but the issues list for a project provides threaded conversations that I think can replace the functionality that we&#39;re using here on this forum, but with a much more modern user interface and experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-small;">
</span></p>
<p>https://github.com/MarimerLLC/cslaforum/issues </p>
<p>The above URL is the site I&#39;ve set up for this - please take a look, try it out, and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>One way or another, this current forum needs to be replaced, as its software is no longer maintained and it will eventually just fail out from under us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 09, 2015</h2><p>The more I use (misuse?) the GitHub issues concept as a forum the more I think it will work nicely as a replacement for this creaky old site.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll decide one way or the other in the next couple weeks, so if you have an opinion speak now! <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 10, 2015</h2><p>The related thread in GitHub is here: </p>

A fair amount of the traffic on this forum are dialogs (like this one) that are disallowed by the SO admins.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Wednesday, June 10, 2015</h2><p>Having been a CSLA user for over a decade (In fact I was trying to digest Rocky&#39;s book that came out before .NET), I have found the forum to be invaluable.&nbsp; All of us longtime users would agree with that sentiment.&nbsp; We don&#39;t always ask a question when simple browsing the site provides an answer. There are not many forums like this one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have not used GitHub much, so I can&#39;t say what it would be like.&nbsp; As I understand, one has to subscribe to use their services, but if the service is worth it, that may not be an issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have to create an account to use this forum too - but all the admin tools for this forum have quit working so I can&#39;t recover your lost passwords or any of that stuff anymore - which is why I need to find _some_ new forum location.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, June 15, 2015</h2><p>Oh, and GitHub accounts are free, so there&#39;s no additional burden there.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
