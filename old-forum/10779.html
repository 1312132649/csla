<p>I&#39;m also puzzled, because I use a TCP binding out of the &quot;WCF box&quot; 
(we use WPF). Why an XML encoding problem? I have been unsure if 
actually binary encoded is used.</p>
<p>Therefore, I looked at the stack a bit in a debugger, 
and although im not a WCF expert, I got to the conculsion that some 
validation is made on XML base,&nbsp; either before or after the actual encoding (that
 I guessed from method names on the stack indicating something like 
&quot;validate&quot;).</p>
<p>The encoder property of some WCF class was set to BinaryFormatter, which is what I really wanted to be sure.</p>
<p>I could the &quot;first chance exception&quot; narrowed to the already 
mentioned auto property in our classes and 
ObservableBindingList (AllowEdit, AllowNew, AllowRemove). So, I stick 
with the &quot;old style&quot; properties with an explicit internal field. That 
reduces the chatty messages in
 VisualStudio&#39;s Output. a lot.&nbsp;</p>
