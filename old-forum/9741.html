I&#39;m at Chapter 4, and I&#39;m somewhat stumped by the implementation of the WebServicePortal. The only guide I could find to implement the portal is in sidebar (pg 211) that says:</p>
<p><i>&quot;Setting up the web services was a little tricky. Before creating the WebServicesProxy, I had to implement the WebServicePortal class ... and temporarily host Csla.dll in a virtual root. That allowed me to add a web reference from the Csla project. Once that web reference was established, I was able to create WebServicesProxy ...&quot;</i></p>
<p>I&#39;d be most grateful for an outline of the steps to implement this portal, please.</p>

<p>With services, there&#39;s the service and the consumer. Typically the consumer is created by adding a service reference to the service - which implies that the service already exists. With Csla.dll this is a little tricky since the service and consumer code are in the same assembly. So you are sort of adding a service reference to yourself.</p>
<p>Still, this implies that the service be created first, so that&#39;s what I did - implement the host part of the data portal. But you still need to <em>actually host the service</em> in order to add the service reference.</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement the host part of the data portal</li>
<li>Compile the project so you have a Csla.dll</li>
<li>Open a new instance of VS and create a temporary web project to actually host Csla.dll and expose the service, and run that web project</li>
<li>Back in the Csla project (original instance of VS) add a service reference to your temporary service, thus adding the client code for the service into the Csla project</li>
<li>Save the Csla project</li>
<li>Close and discard the temporary web project</li>
</ol>

My reference to consolidating OOD knowledge pertained to the book in its entirety (not just the portal implementation). By the time I complete the Csla project and the ProjectTracker, I hope to have consolidated all the OOD knowledge I&#39;ve gleaned from here, there and everywhere; the book is priceless in that regard. And, contrary to what my earlier post may suggest, I honestly find the book intuitive and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
