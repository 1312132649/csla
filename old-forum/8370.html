They cannot have validation rules, which is where the parent property is used the most within lists.<br /><br />I think the more important question is what do you want to try and achieve by using this property on these objects? If we know that we might be able to point you in the right direction.<br /><br />John</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Kevin Fairclough replied on Monday, January 18, 2010</h2>Hi<br><br>Currently I use bi-directional parent-child relationships because of NHibernate,&nbsp; this is working ok for editable objects as I have the Parent property which I use to obtain the <b>true</b> parent, bypassing the actual list parent.&nbsp; <br><br>I was trying to query my other similar objects (RO's) using the query language HQL (NHibernate.)
