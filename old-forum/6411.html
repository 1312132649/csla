<P>I just took a quick look at the 2 handbooks and my conclusion is that the new book does cover much of that material - but in the most up to date fashion. In other words, whatever changes Rocky has come up with since those handbooks were first published are reflected in the new book. There may be some specific topics/issues in the handbooks which are not covered in the new book but it looks like the majority of the material is covered.</P>
<P>If you are on an older version of CSLA then you should read the handbooks.</P>
<P>If you want to understand what is going on in 3.5/3.6 then read the new book.</P>

<P>There are some web features that are only discussed in the 2.1 handbook (sorting/filtering primarily).</P>
<P>There's some background on Windows Forms data binding in the 3.0 book that may be important to fully understanding how and why the CslaActionExtender exists in 3.6. </P>
<P>And the only current coverage of Windows Workflow is in the 3.0 ebook.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
