<p>need some article on how the serialization process happens&nbsp;between client n server data portals while performing CRUD on editable BO and editable BO lists and what all events are involved in this&nbsp;from dev point of view&nbsp;?</p>
<p>Also, would like to know how best can we use events like OnDeserialized and for what purposed this event is used .</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Saturday, March 14, 2015</h2><p>Csla just uses standard .ne serialization, so anything you find on the internet applies.&nbsp; The hooks allow you to plug into the process is you have a special need but if you&#39;re sticking to standard Csla base classes and use registerpropery / fieldmanager you shouldn&#39;t need to do anything.&nbsp; the eBooks have more details on when you might need to hook into the process and why.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, March 15, 2015</h2><p>I also recommend the CSLA 4 EBooks. </p>
<p>CSLA. uses standard formatters in .NET but also has it&#39;s own MobileFormatter.</p>
<p>OnDeserialized may be used for custom serialization or to reestablish inter-graph references after deserialization.&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
