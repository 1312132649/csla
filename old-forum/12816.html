<p>-The model from Viewmodel is to be assigned to a Model Collectiion View Source on the event Model_Changed</p>
<p>-The Grid will bind to Model Collection View Source</p>
<p>-I looked at <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/9985/46825.aspx#46825">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/9985/46825.aspx#46825</a>, they are binding it to a observable collection, but I found issues binding grid to a collection view source for the model of the view model </p>
<p>-Are there any conventions with Data Grid binding with caliburn ? The link did not mention datasource/itemsouce on the data grid but the name of the grid matched observable collection . I wanted to&nbsp;know all such conventions.</p>
<p>Kindly suggest &nbsp;</p>
