<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>First of all, I want to say that you guys have done an awesome job with the CSLA templates.&nbsp; Nice work!!&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>I was wondering if you guys would be willing to let me include the latest CSLA CodeSmith templates in the CodeSmith 4.0 installation as sample templates.&nbsp; There would be readme files inside of the template folders giving credit to the project and would have a link to the project page.</FONT></P>

Disclaimer: I haven't made any contributions to these templates -- at least not yet, so it wouldn't be proper for me to say, but it would be great to have them included in CS 4.0.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rasupit replied on Tuesday, October 10, 2006</h2><P>Eric,</P>
<P>It won't be possible without your great tool. <img src="/emoticons/emotion-22.gif" alt="Beer [B]" /></P>
<P>I can't speak for all templates on CSLA Contrib, but you're welcome to include CSLA2.x&nbsp;Templates for C#.</P>
<P>I'm however targeting the templates for CodeSmith 2.6.&nbsp; I haven't tested with other version but based from feedbacks, they seem to work just fine with CodeSmith 3.2.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Let me know if you need anything else.</P>

<P>I've made some extensions to CSLA that add SmartInt16, SmartInt32,SmartInt64 and SmartBool to the list of classes like the pre-existing SmartDate class in CSLA.&nbsp; I've also got a subclassed version of SafeDataReader that recognizes the new "Smart" classes.&nbsp; My intent is to create all the other "missing" smart classes.</P>
<P>I've already put the above classes into the CSLA contrib project.&nbsp; Would you like to distribute them also?&nbsp; Ditto for templates updated to (optionally) support them?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ericjsmith replied on Saturday, November 11, 2006</h2>If you have made contributions to the CSLA templates and would like to get a free license for CodeSmith 4.0, please send me a private message with your full name, email address and some sort of proof as to your contributions.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
