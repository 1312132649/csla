<p>So your best option is to create a separate WCF Service with message contracts to expose those objects and actions that an external app may use. The recommandation is to create new message contract objects and map values to/from your CSLA business objects in order to reuse the logic.&nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>joseph99 replied on Tuesday, October 02, 2012</h2><p>I have separate WCF classes that are filled using the CSLA business objects.&nbsp; The area where I am having an issue the the custom authentication the CLSA uses.&nbsp; I have not been able to find a work around.&nbsp; Thanks for the help. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about that specific technology, but I do know that relatively few client stacks fully support WS-* because it is really hard to get right, so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they can&#39;t handle it.</p>
<p>You might need to switch to a basicHttp binding and use a less sophisticated authentication model.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
