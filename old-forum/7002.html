I test
it. It was working correctly on my PC. Then, I have problem with my system. I’ve
changed HD and I’ve reinstalled Windows, Silverlight … . 

<br>
<br>
Now, when I try to run my CslaLight application, it doesn’t
work. I can’t authenticate my login info.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I thought that something wrong with Csla dll’s therefore I’ve regenerated
them and referenced them from the project. This doesn’t solve my problem. 

<br>Then, I thought that it is time to debug sever side. I set up
a new class library project, attached it to WCF development server. It never
hit break point on server side. At this point, I decided that I have problem
with WCF. I compared definition and endpoints in Web.config and
ServiceReference.ClientConfig files. They look OK for me. More, I compared Wcf
setting with Rolodex working project. WCF’s setting, binding definition and end
point definition, in my project and Rolodex looks for me the same (with
exception of port number).<br>
<br>
Any suggestion, how to figure out my problem?

<br>
<br>
Thanks

I’m running CLSA 3.6.2 version.
