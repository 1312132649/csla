<P>I fully appreciate the argument that partial classes result in a lot more files, but compiler directives result in very messy code (imo).</P>
<P>In the end, I think it is just a matter of coming up with standards <EM>for your project</EM> so you are consistent across the code base.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CampbellCM replied on Monday, June 01, 2009</h2>I'm currently working on a CSLA Light project, several assemblies in fact.  My situation is that I am the only person working on the SL side of things with several other developers working on the server side of things.  Using partial classes has removed a lot of friction from the project in several ways.  It is easier for multiple developers to work on the same classes if they are partials and the developers that are focusing on the server functionality don't even know that the SL code exists.  To me its all about reducing friction and with a tight deadline on an LOB application the less friction the better.<br /><br />That's my 2 cents.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 02, 2009</h2>I should say that in the demos for the video series I'm using partial classes. I do discuss the use of compiler directives, but the partials make it so much easier and cleaner to talk about what's going on that I really do favor their use.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
