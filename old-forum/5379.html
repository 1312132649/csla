An example is, a list of IDs that was selected through checkboxes. I have been using the same running code on all my projects. But with,  binding a GridView to a dataset. <br /><br />My problem is when I implemented the code with binding a GridView to a CslaDataSource. Where I save the "selected IDs" is in the PageIndexChanging event. But, I noticed that, after clicking a page number, the SelectObject event fires first before the PageIndexChanging event. My problem with this behavior is that my GridView.Rows.Count is zero. Meaning that, I cant' get the selected/checked IDs, before the GridView changes the page.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
