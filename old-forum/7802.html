I am looking at doing a system using Silverlight and have downloaded the relevant files from the downloads section.<br /><br />I am using VS2008. CSLA.NET 3.7.1 and Silverlight 3.0<br /><br />I also downloaded and installed the Silverlight tools.<br /><br />I opened the csla.sln and built it, then the cslalightcs.sln and built that.<br /><br />Then I opened the Rolodex solution, fixed the csla references (by removing them and adding them back in) and tried to build that, but got some errors and warnings.  Is there something that I've missed out?  <br /><br />Here are the errors, there are 6 warnings as well that I can post here if it will help diagnose my problems:<br /><br />Error	1	The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'Csla.PropertyInfo.PropertyInfo(string, string, Csla.RelationshipTypes)' and 'Csla.PropertyInfo.PropertyInfo(string, string, decimal)'	C:\Documents and Settings\frank\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\csla\CslaLight\cs\Rolodex\Business\Server\BusinessClasses\CompanyContact.cs	109	89	Rolodex.Business.Client<br /><br />Error	2	The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'Csla.PropertyInfo.PropertyInfo(string, string, Csla.RelationshipTypes)' and 'Csla.PropertyInfo.PropertyInfo(string, string, decimal)'	C:\Documents and Settings\frank\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\csla\CslaLight\cs\Rolodex\Business\Server\BusinessClasses\CompanyContact.cs	109	89	Rolodex.Business.Server<br /><br />Error	7	Metadata file 'C:\Documents and Settings\frank\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\csla\CslaLight\cs\Rolodex\Business\Client\Bin\Debug\Rolodex.Business.dll' could not be found	Rolodex<br /><br />Error	8	The type or namespace name 'SilverlightControls' does not exist in the namespace 'System.Web.UI' (are you missing an assembly reference?)
