<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I am almost finished (I guess 100 pages left&nbsp;on a&nbsp;600 page book is almost)&nbsp;with Expert VB 2005 Business Objects. While I understand the individual concepts and procedures, grasping the entire framework as a whole has proved to be a challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp; The framework has come a long way since the&nbsp;VB6 book.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I work for a school and&nbsp; I am creating a BO layer to work with an existing records database.&nbsp; I have a&nbsp;person object that keeps all the properties that are common to all individuals in the database (eg FirstName, LastName, etc). This object inherits from ReadOnlyBase because my application cannot change the data in the database.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I would like to create a student object that inherits all the properties of the person object.&nbsp; My initial attempt was this:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>&lt;Serializable()&gt; Public Class Student<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inherits Person</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>However, that does not work because Person does not have a public constructor and I know that creating one would break the shared factory method of creating objects.&nbsp; I'm sure I'm just missing something. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Thanks,</FONT></P>

How your DataPortal_Fetch works is up to you based on your database design.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hurcane replied on Wednesday, March 28, 2007</h2>Person needs to have a Protected constructor to use inheritance.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
