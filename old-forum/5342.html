This search functionality will only be used return a list of MedicalProviders for display (sorting and paging are necessary though), a user can then click on one these many items to load another page (web) to edit the item.<br><br>Would it be smarter to build a seperate MedicalProviderSearchResult object based on ReadOnlyBase and return a list of these objects based on the search criteria?<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br><br>Thanks,<br>CKA<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 04, 2008</h2>Yes, absolutely! I discuss this in the book too, and this is why ProjectTracker has the ProjectList object, which is a ReadOnlyListBase subclass.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
