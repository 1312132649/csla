Typically, this is done as follows:<br><br><font face="Courier New"><span>Public Overrides ReadOnly Property</span> IsDirty() <span>As Boolean</span></font><br><font face="Courier New"><span>&nbsp; Get</span></font><br><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Return MyBase</span>.IsDirty <span>OrElse</span> mChild1.IsDirty <span>OrElse</span> mChild2.IsDirty</font><br><font face="Courier New">&nbsp; <span>End Get</span></font><br><font face="Courier New"><span>End Property</span></font><br><br>This patten makes a lot of sense to me. If you have grandchild objects, everything casades down automatically. It also makes it easy to create a checklist for developers when adding an editable child object. The checklist incudes items to override IsDirty and IsValid.<br><br>What about MarkOld? In 2.x, MarkOld is automatically called by the data portal when fetching and updating a root object. The examples in the book and the templates all include MarkOld calls inside of the Friend-scoped data methods (Insert, Update, etc.).<br><br>Would it make sense to override MarkOld in the parent object and make calls to MarkOld on the child objects, following the same pattern as IsDirty and IsValid?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hurcane replied on Friday, October 13, 2006</h2>Well, I found a technical problem already. MarkOld is protected, so a parent business object can't call it directly. I still think this pattern makes sense, so I'm trying to come up with a way to implement it.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
