By right clicking on the Solution 'Rolodex' node of the Solution Explorer and choosing "Properties", I see that "Current Selection" is set as the Startup Project.<br /><br />As I have understood from some threads here, the "Web" project should be the Startup project.  Is that right?<br /><br />If I run with "Web" as the startup project I get the login form displaying, but always get "Invalid User" when I try the suggested user id and password.  Doing it this way displays one ASP.NET Development server icon in the System Tray.<br /><br />However, if I first run with "WcfHostWeb" as the currently selected (and hence startup) project, then I run with "Web" selected, I am then able to login successfully.  Doing things this way displays two ASP.NET Development server icons in the System Tray.<br /><br />Is this (the second technique) the way that things are supposed to be done, or is the WcfHostWeb supposed to run automatically?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Monday, November 16, 2009</h2>I really hope that my first message was just missed.  Can anyone explain this to me?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Monday, November 16, 2009</h2>I tend to set things up under IIS so this isn't entirely applicable to me but you do know you can specify more than one startup project, right? </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>FCazabon replied on Monday, November 16, 2009</h2>Yes, I have encountered that.  But as this is the sample that comes with the framework I didn't want to change the default way of working.  So are you saying the sample is not configured properly and I should set both the projects up to start?<br /><br />Thanks for jumping in :)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sergeyb replied on Monday, November 16, 2009</h2>Just to make it clear, the solution was setup to illustrate how to setup WCF host and Silverlight host in separate projects (in case you would like to scale them separately).  On another note, I always combine those two projects into one during development to ease the debugging.<br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: FCazabon [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Monday, November 16, 2009 11:22 AM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] Understanding the Rolodex Sample<br /><br />Yes, I have encountered that.
