<p>I am using CSLA version 4.3.1.0 and Silverlight 5. &nbsp;I am getting an error message that is very strange. &nbsp;When I try to create a new business object I am getting an error&nbsp;Could not find default endpoint element that references contract &#39;WcfPortal.IWcfPortal. &nbsp;I do not have an endpoint with the name. &nbsp;I could find no reference in my code that says&nbsp;WcfPortal.IWcfPortal. &nbsp;Does anyone know why I would be getting a message for and endpoint contract name that does not exist in my code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The data portal defaults to using the WCF proxy to talk to an app server, but you need to supply the url for the server.</p>
<p>The contract you are seeing is the data portal contract.</p>
<p>Or you can set the proxy name to Local to run the data access code on the client. Obviously that has a whole other set of implications.</p>
<p>The Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration book has a lot of detail on all the various configuration options.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>smgrisw replied on Friday, February 17, 2012</h2><p>Dear Mr. Lhotka,</p>
