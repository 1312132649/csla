<P>I've some nice things working with my web forms - so far, everything works as advertised.&nbsp; One minor problem is that I use GUIDS for my id values.&nbsp; This is a problem because when I do an update I don't want to display the GUID to the user but if the guid isn't visible then apparently the e.values won't contain the GUID for me to do the lookup with.</P>
<P>See page 548 in the book for an example of an update.</P>
<P>The only way I seem to be able to get the GUID into the e.values collection so that I can use the GUID to pull the object out of the collection for updating is by making it visible.&nbsp; Any way around this?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 05, 2006</h2>Look at PTWeb. I do this in Chapter 10, by including the data in a column, but then making the column not visible.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
