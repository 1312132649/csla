What I have is a multiview with a grid view in one view and a formview in another for a list of customer objects. When a customer is selected the view is switched to the form view and is displayed correctly. Now inside the formview which shows a single customer I also need to display that customer's contacts in a gridview&nbsp;which is a list in the customer class. Since the contacts gridview will allow the same functionality as the customer one I have a multiview included for contacts too. Populating all individually seems to work fine but I need to have the contacts gridview and formview use the same datasource as the customer one. Anyone have a complex situation like this one? Any ideas would be appreciated.</P>
