<p>However some of the attributes of the parent are editable ... so it is an Editable Root with a read only child collection ....</p>
<p>In trying to follow the published pattern ... the one I&#39;m referencing now ( from the &quot;code reduction with child objects&quot;) requires that the child collection&nbsp;inherit from BusinessListBase&nbsp;.... Have a NewList() method.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not the case here.</p>
<p>Any documentation / suggestions&nbsp;on how I might make this work using ReadOnlyListBase ??</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

If the parent doesn&#39;t have responsibility for creating/saving the children, they aren&#39;t children.</p>
<p>You are probably better off using a <i>unit of work</i> object (<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/CslaObjectFaq.ashx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/CslaObjectFaq.ashx</a>).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
