This assumes you configure your webapp and smartclient app to use remoting (or webservices) to acquire data. <br>- on the database level (in a DAL) so that all clients from whatever direction they approach your DB benefit from the same cache;<br><br>The closer to your DBs you implement the cache, the more clients are likely to benefit from cache. But also the longer the route from your clients towards your cache and the less performance benefit is acquired. <br><br>I haven't implemented caching yet, so I can't give code examples. But we plan to implement caching on the RemotingHost. All our DBs are hidden behind this host, so caching simultaneously benefits our smart client users and web app users (since both are configured to use the Remoting Host as dataportal). We have like 3-4 databases only, so even if I would have implemented it already I cannot tell if it would scale to your 80 DBs. However, the advantage is that the remotinghost can easily be run on its own dedicated machine (or cluster) so in the end it <i>is </i>scalable.<br><br>Implementation-wise .... have you had a look as the Cache Application Block from Microsoft already?<br><br>Regards,<br>Bayu<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
