<P>according to the CommonRules I have created my own class MyCommonRules to extend the available common validation rules. Now I want to use culture dependend strings for the broken rule messages as is implemented in the CSLA. Is it possible to assign another set of string resources to the assembly containing the business objects? Can multiple String resources be used for each assembly (what about the UI assembly?) How is this to perform in .Net 2.0?</P>
<P>Thanks for any help or hint!</P>
<P>Best regards, Harald</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 27, 2006</h2><P>If you look at your project's properties (where you set assembly info, compiler info, sign the assembly, etc.) you'll find&nbsp;a resources tab. Resources you add here become part of your assembly, and you can localize them like I did with Csla.dll.</P>
<P>These resources automatically become available to your code, in your assembly, just like the resources in Csla.dll are available to the code in the Csla project.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
