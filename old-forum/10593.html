<p>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648505.aspx</p>
<p>Why would want to do this without any real security?&nbsp; Because it is quite easy to do, and then when the Principal is accessed in the portal, the correct credentials are used.&nbsp; In my application we use this for user logging for Notes, change history, etc.&nbsp; It is an internal application that is running on a Terminal Services machine connecting to the application server running the WcfPortal through IIS.&nbsp; All the network traffic is on the domain and the servers are connected on the same switch completely behind a firewall, so encrypting with SSL, etc is unnecessary overkill.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most of the articles I could find (including using CSLA 3.0 eBooks) had a whole mess of steps to get certificates created and installed, etc - all I wanted was to have the right user show in the logs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Hope this makes it easier for someone else to find this solution in the future ( Took about 5 minutes to implement, and hour or two or research to find the solution).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
