<P>However, it appears to me that the FieldDataManager for such an object will allocate an IFieldData slot in the (in _fieldData) for each such property -- even though I don't plan to use it -- if&nbsp; I include any completely managed properties in the same object.</P>
<P>My concern is that, for example, I might have previously had an object whose field members included&nbsp;50 or so value types, and now I've added an empty array of 50 null IFieldData references, which could be more than double the size in some cases. </P>
<P>Another minor concern is that I could mix calls --&nbsp;those that specify the backing field and those that don't, and the framework wouldn't catch this. I'd almost suggest that a different type of PropertyInfo should be used with private backing fields. </P>
<P>Is my interpretation of this correct? And if so, should I just not worry about the size issue (e.g. the empty IFieldData slots wouldn't be serialized, etc.)?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
