<p>I have 3.8 movies and CSLA4 .pdf books that I got a couple years (or so) ago.</p>
<p>We are about to start a new project using MVVM, WPF/SL and I would like to update myself with a new information available.</p>
<p>So, I went to a store page and found no information to figure out if books for sale are newer or the same I have.</p>
<p>I see some MVVM items that I do not have . That is it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you help me with that?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, February 25, 2014</h2><p>The latest books are the &quot;Using CSLA 4&quot; series.</p>
<p>The MMVM videos cover CSLA 4 and version 3.8.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
