<P>are there any modified versions that "fit" csla I should look at ?</P>
<P>I am trying some small edits to the default codesmith templates but I am not real familiar yet with the code in them etc...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>for example I want my inserts to not include some items and get the database defaults</P>
<P>like creation datetime.</P>
<P>and not include that in any updates unless used as part of the "WHERE ...."</P>
<P>but do include it in all the "SELECT ... FROM ... "</P>
<P>the cs default template will fiilter columns but it does not have (as far as I can tell) an option like the one I am describing.</P>
<P>I am sure in time I can modify the standard ones to suit me but has anyone done some of this already ??</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
