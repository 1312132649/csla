On application startup I preform all access checks and cache the result in the Csla.ApplicationContext. <br><br>If you are a 3rd party developer and you want to standardize your authorizaztion you definately need to check out <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/netsqlazman">http://sourceforge.net/projects/netsqlazman</a> <br><br>Rob<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>milecker replied on Thursday, June 21, 2007</h2><P>Rob,</P>
<P>While I agree with you that there are some nice enhancmenets/fixes over azman, there are in my opinion a few large issues related to NetSQLAzman.</P>
<P>i) Permission checks are performed in the data tier. Major no-no in development since you are now tied to SQL server implimentation + as general rule business logic goes on in the middle tier so as not be tied to the storage provider.</P>
<P>ii)Interface. While Azman suffered from only supporting NT users/groups, netSqlAzman also is limited since it takes an IPrinciple object as part of the interface for an access check. This defeats the purpose in my option of a general authorization tool. A generic authorization tool should only take a string Ex- "Domain\UserId" or "testAccount". This allows for anytime of user {NT,Application, etc}.</P>
<P>iii)Not the ideal client/server solution where a client is passed a set of valid operations that are cached for the "Session". To this end, I think that ideally in an enterprise there should be a web service which provides and interface for many applications to make calls in to get permissions.</P>
<P>Mind you there were some major improvements over azman including the web interface, item authorization and the ability to&nbsp;have "Custom users" that are not NT accounts.</P>
