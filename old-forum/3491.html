<P>You were a huge help to me when I was first looking at CodeSmith for CSLA 1.x a year and a half ago.&nbsp;Many thanks!&nbsp;I ended up going with MyGeneration because (1) I liked the ability to write the template code in Visual Studio rather than the way CodeSmith does it (is that asp script?? - I'm still doing Windows apps and that stuff looks odd to me &lt;G&gt;) and (2) the great flexibility of defining meta-data.&nbsp; The control you have in building whatever user interface you want is surely powerful, too.&nbsp; But I haven't exploited that in any real way.&nbsp; I just haven't needed to.</P>
<P>So I built lots of CSLA 1.x templates.&nbsp; You're welcome to those if you want them.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I haven't decided how to do CSLA 2.x yet.&nbsp; I downloaded the CSLAGen project and have been impressed with its capabilities.&nbsp; I just haven't decided whether or not I have enough control in their project UI to avoid having to work on my own templates.&nbsp; My first few VS2005 apps haven't needed CSLA, so I still haven't had to make the choice.</P>
<P>I know 1.x templates aren't anything to get excited over, but you didn't get any other responses &lt;g&gt;.&nbsp; And I'd be happy to introduce you to the process of editing the templates via a remote connection if you'd like to give it a try.&nbsp; And, of course, they'll work as they are for VS2005, too.&nbsp; But then you miss all the goodies of CSLA 2.x (its use of partial classes and generics, better Validation, the new DataPortal events, etc., etc.).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Respond here or e-mail me directly at account name QJohnson using domain TeamNFP (it's a COM not one of those others) if you're interested in looking at them.</P>
<P>Regards,</P>

<P>In the future I will either get involved with the CSLAgen source code, write my own generator using CodeSmith or move to MyGeneration.&nbsp; When that time comes I will send you an email to pick your brain about MyGeneration.&nbsp;</P>
