<P>Is this an oversight in BusinessBase, or is there a good reason for this to be this way?&nbsp; &nbsp;I can still write "Overloads" functions in BusinessBase derived classes with the same signatures and will do so unless there's a good reason not to.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P>

<P>Hope that helps.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BBM replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2><P>Thanks, that makes sense.</P>
<P>Hey, I guess I should look at the code first next time!</P>
<P>Thanks again.</P>
