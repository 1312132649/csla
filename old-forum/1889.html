There was a thread about creating a new Error Provider that supported
Warnings and Information, but I don't think anything has been started
on it.&nbsp; <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Saturday, December 02, 2006</h2>You could try the error treeview I implemented. It's available in the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CSLAcontrib">codeplex site</a>.<br>It's not very obvious where you can download it from, since the "release modes" in codeplex suck (at least that's what I think).<br><br>Here's a direct link to the download:<br>http://www.codeplex.com/Project/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=CSLAcontrib&amp;DownloadId=2525<br><br>It won't do what you're trying to do (which is show the correct icon in the grid), but it allows you to see the errors in a tree including warnings and information. You can point the user to the correct row when a user double clicks the tree node by using an event. Check out the sample app to see how it works.<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>shawndewet replied on Sunday, December 03, 2006</h2><P>Thanx Andres,</P>
<P>I'll check it out.&nbsp; What I've done in the meantime is to build a check into my validation method to see if the object is dirty.&nbsp; The validation now only fails if the object is not dirty.&nbsp; That way&nbsp;the warning&nbsp;shows up as an error in the grid (my grid is only displaying Old, Non-Dirty objects),&nbsp;but while an object is dirty, the validation "succeeds", and allows a save without the "Object is not valid..." error.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
