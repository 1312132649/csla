<P>thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, May 23, 2008</h2><P>This was a change made in version 3.0.2 to address ongoing issues with data binding in Windows Forms. You can read through the change log, and there are a couple long and thorough threads on the forum from that time period where you can see the research that went into this change (several people on the forum were instrumental in figuring this out - thank you guys!!).</P>
<P>It does appear that there's a bug with the 3.5 code you are showing. See these threads</P>

<P>I have a possible fix checked into the C# version of 3.5 in svn that hopefully addresses the issue.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
