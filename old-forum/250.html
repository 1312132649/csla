<P>My question is&nbsp;if a Editableroot object(BusinessBase) can have more than one child collection?</P>
<P>regards</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 02, 2006</h2>Yes, certainly. Just repeat the pattern discussed in Chapter 7 for the Project class, regarding the field, property and overrides of IsValid and IsDirty for each child collection.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Friday, June 02, 2006</h2>Absolutely. It can have as many child collections or child objects as you want, whether it's a good idea or not, but that's another topic. If you have too many child collections sometimes it's a good idea to do lazy loading. Look that up in searchcsla.com and you'll find a lot of examples....<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
