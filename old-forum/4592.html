<P>groupsGrid.DataSource = (Asset)Model.GroupList.SelectedGroup;</P>
<P>So in the vertical grid, it will show just a single item, yet, it wont show the Asset properties that are there.</P>

<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cafefx replied on Wednesday, April 02, 2008</h2><P>Just wanted to let everyone know my problem was solved.</P>
<P>The&nbsp;grid actualy did bind correctly.</P>
<P>Using Grid.Rows.Clear() between binds did the trick.</P>
<P>The new properties show up and save&nbsp;correctly.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
