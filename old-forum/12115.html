<p>Is it possible for you to share the EF-code?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>It was more than just code to get it working. &nbsp;I upgraded the entire solution to CSLA&nbsp;4.5.32 (beta), EF5, MVC4 and added the DbContext generation to the model. &nbsp;I can certainly help get you up and running if you are having trouble doing any of those things. &nbsp;The code changes were very trivial.</p>

<p>I had some difficulties to get it running, so I took another approach, not using the code first approach, and then haven&#39;t bother to dig any deeper in it (the project had to move on). But that was before the CSLA 4.5.32 version, so maybe that upgrade would have solved everything. </p>
<p>When I saw your post, I just thought it would have been interesting to see how you solved it and compare with my code&nbsp;(since I still have the code history from TFS). No worries though.</p>
