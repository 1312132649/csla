The user wants to put a default value on a textbox not attached anywhere and click a button and update the current row with all the rates with that default rate.<BR>This is what I currently do<BR>decimal rate = Convert.ToDecimal( textBoxRateOverride.Text );<BR>Destination currentDestination = (Destination)destinationsBindingSource.Current;<BR>currentDestination.rate_a = rate;<BR>currentDestination.rate_b = rate;<BR>currentDestination.rate_c = rate; <BR>this.destinationsBindingSource.RaiseListChangedEvents = true;<BR>which works.</P>
<P>Is this an acceptable way?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Saturday, October 13, 2007</h2><font face="Arial"><font size="2">The only thing that I would contemplate doing is putting a method on the ERLB that takes the rate and applies it to all items within itself, this would then remove the responsibility from the UI designer to have to do apply the correct rate to the each item. You could then stop the list changing events from within that method and the UI designer would only need to worry about getting the rate and calling your method.<br><br>Anyone else got an opinon? I'm still getting my head around alot of this stuff.<br></font></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GeorgeG replied on Tuesday, October 16, 2007</h2><P>You are right. Doing it on the business object makes more sense. </P>
<P>Thanks</P>
