<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Path must be a valid file.</P>
<P>An error of type "ArgumentException" occured while attempting to execute this template.&nbsp; To enable Just-In-Time debugging on this template set the "Debug" attribute to "True" in the "CodeTemplate" directive and add a "Debugger.Break()" statement in the template.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>laineboe replied on Sunday, June 11, 2006</h2><P>Hi,</P>
<P>I ran into the same problem.&nbsp; Csla.cst relies on other templates and&nbsp;is having trouble finding them.</P>
<P>I solved&nbsp;the problem as&nbsp;follows:</P>
<P>In Csla.cst, change</P>
<P>&nbsp;string templateName = objectType.ToString() + ".cst";&nbsp;</P>
<P>to</P>
<P>&nbsp;string templateName = this.CodeTemplateInfo.DirectoryName + objectType.ToString() + ".cst";&nbsp;<BR></P>
<P>Hope this helps</P>

<P>That actually what I suggested and posted the changes when Sankar74 posted the error message at <A href="http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/cslacstemplate">http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/cslacstemplate</A>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks for the feedback and your suggested solution.&nbsp;And also is good to hear that these templates will also work with CodeSmith 3.2.</P>
<P>BTW,&nbsp; GotDotNet really&nbsp;sucks.&nbsp; I've been getting errors when trying to access the Source Control.&nbsp; Finally I was able to access it last night, but all my check ins on Source Control and replies on Message Board was not under Sankar74.&nbsp; Go figure....</P>
