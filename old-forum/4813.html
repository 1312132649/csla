But, later, I realized that this is not related to CSLA. But, I hope that I can get help from here if possible.<br><br>The complete problem details:<br><p>I have been working with different
web sites/projects/solutions using VS2005 on local Windows XP machine.
I usually move such solutions/project to Windows Server 2003
development machine (before final Go Live) and I open them from my
local machine over a file share on the server and continue development using this method (over file share). I always turn on
impersonation using a DOMAIN Account because all web sites need to
access resources (such CONNX Data Dictionary and license Files) located
on other remote machines.</p><p>I have been following this method for
more than a year until now. I mean that I setup the permission needed
for the asp_wp.exe ( or w3wp.exe) user account and did all other
required settings. I put the ASP.NET Impersonated Account in the Local
Administrators Group of the Server Machine and did the same on my local
machine. Not only that, I also put "NETWORK SERVICE" and the Anonymous
IUSR_MACHINE in the Local Admins Group on both machines too. So far, no
problem, every thing is so cool !<br></p><p>Just yesterday, I am
getting the following error soon after I open any Project/Solution
from my machine, where the project/solution is located on a file share
on the remote server (both machines are part of the DOMAIN), and I get
the error even before I compile/run the web site.<br></p>
<p>"Failed to start monitoring changes to '\\devmachine\websites\...\global.asax' because access is denied."</p><p>Sometimes the problem file is '\\devmachine\websites\...\default.aspx' or '...\web.config'.</p><p>I reviewed the security settings on my machine and the server machine and every thing seems to be in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I open the solution locally from the server machine, then no error. The Site will compile and run.</p><p>If
I turn off impersonation, the error is cleared/resolved even from my machine. If I turn on
impersonation and put an incorrect password, the error is cleared too, but I get the error when try to use the required resources from the other remote servers.</p><p>I deleted the related folders from "Temporary ASP.NET" folder, but this did not help at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The
only thing I remember which I did recently is that I used "NGEN.EXE" on
my local machine to generate native code for one of the class library
projects with DEBUG Symbols to try to use remote debugging with Native
Code only (but it did not work!). I noticed that this command not only
worked on the specified Library file, it also included many other
libraries not related to me. Not sure why ?</p><p>Also, I applied a recent Service Pack for .NET 2.0 on the server, but I did not apply it on&nbsp; my machine.</p><p>This error really driving me crazy !!!!</p><p>Please help.</p><p>Tarek. <br></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Paul Czywczynski replied on Tuesday, May 06, 2008</h2>Did you try this:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317955">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317955</a> ?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tarekahf replied on Wednesday, May 07, 2008</h2><P>Thanks a lot !</P>
<P>Did you know how many times I came across this KB Article in Microsoft. But since I was sure the permission are correct, I was saying to myself that no need to check it !!.</P>
<P>But, after your post, I decided to re-check. Then I figured out that I am opening the Solution over the share, but the Share Permission (not NT File Permission) does not have the ASP .NET Impersonated Account. So, I said "Let me added it !" and after I added the account on the share permission with Read/Write Access,&nbsp;all the errors were resolved.</P>
<P>So, I said "Why it was working fine in the past ?", and I think the answer is that, in the past I was using the Admin Share such as <A>\\devmachine\e$\...\solution..</A>, not a regular share. Just recently I started using a regular file share and I thought that no need to add the ASP Account on the share permission since it is already under the Admins Group. But no, I still have to add this account on the share permission, and I think this is another Microsoft Bug.</P>
<P>Can you imagine that I found many resolutions which are mostly related to permission, but non of them suggested to check the permission on the share itself. Also, very little cases I found where developers are opening projects over a file share. Is this method bad or what ?</P>
