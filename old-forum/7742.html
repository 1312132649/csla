If you are given the same problem, how you will approach it with advantages and disadvantages of current approach v/s my approach..<br /><br />I'm posting it here bcos here lot of experts are posting and they are aware of both csla and db design..<br /><br />so your advs/comments are needed...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Thursday, October 08, 2009</h2>any advs/comments/help on this..</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
