<p>I want to be able to offload all my authentication calls to a second Wcf service and have all regular data portal calls go through their own. How would this be accomplished? I do have the ebooks, although stuff like this is mentioned I but I can&#39;t seem to find any information on how to complete it.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help possible.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
