I assume it is a Community Server 2.0 issue, but I'm in the middle of intense travel and don't have the time to google around to find a solution (if there is one). In perhaps 10 days or so, when I get off the road, I'll see what I can find out in this regard.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dredge replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>This feature does not appear to be working reliably.

<P>This is a known issue in Community Server 2.0. My website (avocadosoftware.com) also suffers from this. There are several posts over at the official community server site that talk about this issue and how to work around it. most of the fixes involve setting the machine key in the web.config file.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
