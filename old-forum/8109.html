The idea that any one set of common rules will meet everyone's needs is unrealistic, so when a rule doesn't meet your needs you should feel free to write your own rule methods in your own rule library.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>shrage replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2>If i might suggest, a simple IsRequired flag to the RuleArgs base class, and all common rules to use this flag to know how to treat empty values. This piece of information makes sense to all rules.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2>It's too easy to just write this yourself. You can even call the existing CSLA rule. Start your own rule collection with this one:   :)<br /><br /><pre><br />        public static bool NonEmptyStringMinLength(object target, RuleArgs e)<br />        {<br />            string value = (string)Utilities.CallByName(<br />              target, e.PropertyName, CallType.Get);<br />            return string.IsNullOrEmpty(value) || Csla.Validation.CommonRules.StringMinLength(target, e);<br />        }<br /> </pre></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>shrage replied on Tuesday, December 08, 2009</h2>Yea you are right, at least i know that's by design and not that i did something wrong ;-)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
