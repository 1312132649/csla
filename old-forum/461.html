<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm about 100 pages into the book and I must say that this is one of the best books on .NET that I've read.&nbsp; The book is written in a way that is easy to understand so far.&nbsp; However, looking at the finished product (the framework source and the ProjectTracker solution) can be very daunting.&nbsp; I've read the PDF on how to build the framework.&nbsp; I made sure that all projects in ProjectTracker have a reference to the framework DLL.&nbsp; I changed the DB connection strings in the app.config to the location of the database files.&nbsp; When I build PTWin, the project builds and I get the login screen.&nbsp; I try to login as user user and VS 2005 breaks out with an unhandled exception.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The exception is of type </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>DataPortalException&nbsp;was unhandled</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DataPortal.Fetch failed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner exception says</DIV>
<DIV>{"An attempt to attach an auto-named database for file C:\development\SourceCode\IE_3.0\Design_Resources\Books\Expert_VB_2005_Business_Objects\Security.mdf failed. A database with the same name exists, or specified file cannot be opened, or it is located on UNC share."}</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'd really love to be able to start stepping through the code as I read the book.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Also, When I build and run PTWin it appears that 4 ASP.NET development servers open in my system tray.&nbsp; I realize that the DataPortal can be local or remote and that the build instructions indicate that it uses the database files as default so any explination as to why these servers are loading.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks in advance to all replies.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Once again, great book.</DIV></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
