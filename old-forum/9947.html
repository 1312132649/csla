<p>Is it intentional that the child_fetch method of an object has this.Parent=null? If it is, why so and what is the recommended method of accessing Parent object in the child_fetch method?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This is a no-win situation. If I reversed the order, and added an unintialized object to the parent, the parent&#39;s rules would run against an empty object and that&#39;d cause all sorts of issues.</p>
<p>The way it works is not accidental - there are fewer scenarios where a child uses the parent during initiazliation than where the parent runs rules as a child is added.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there&#39;s an easy workaround, which is for the parent to pass itself as a parameter to the CreateChild method, in which case the child will have a reference to the parent within the Child_Fetch method.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ranjini replied on Monday, January 17, 2011</h2><p>Thanks for taking the time to clarify. It makes perfect sense..</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
