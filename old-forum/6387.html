<P>I am having a bit of a problem getting my head around the best way of getting the following schenario to work,</P>
<P>Problem<BR>I have a Root Object User which has a collection NextOfKins.<BR>Now I have set up my form with a CSLA Dataprovider that gets the the User, I then bind two way&nbsp;lots of text boxes to the Dataprovider&nbsp; User objectwhich works fine. <BR>I then have a&nbsp;combobox that is bound to the the NextOfKins followed by textboxes that I want to bind to the selected NextOfKin&nbsp;item in the combo box. The problem is I do not know what/how to bind these text boxes. </P>
<P>I have tried to create a new Dataprovider with the type of NextOfKin and then in code setting the data property of this object but the property is readonly.</P>
<P>I know I can bind a datagrid to the NextOfKin object through the dataprovider but there are a lot of properties on the NextOfKin so the grid would need to be massive and would be hard to read and edit.</P>
<P>I also realise that I could create a new root Object NextOfKin and get that object when the combobox is changed but that means the user will need to save the nextofkin each time a change is made. I would rather have a single User object that can be saved once all the changes have been made.</P>
<P>Is it possible to do as I would like I seem to be going round in&nbsp; circles at the moment</P>
<P>Cheers</P>

<P>Assuming your overall data context is the root object, you might have this:</P>
<P>&lt;Grid DataContext="{Binding Source={StaticResource Mydata},Path=Data}" /&gt;</P>
<P>Your normal controls use binding expressions just to set the Path.</P>
<P>But you can always have a control set its DataContext, and if that's a container control, that new data context applies to all the controls it contains.</P>
<P>I think you can do this:</P>
<P>&lt;StackPanel DataContext="{Binding Path=ChildProperty}" /&gt;</P>
<P>where 'ChildProperty' is the property of the root that refers to the child object.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>danielw replied on Tuesday, February 10, 2009</h2><P>Hi Rocky,</P>
<P>Thanks for the reply.</P>
<P>I can see how this works for a single Child Property. But will this work for a child collection the issue I have got is how to set the controls datacontext to a specific child of the collection. ie if i select the 5th child in the collection via the dropdown i need the controls to display the data. Does the Dataprovider know about current item.</P>

<P>Many 3rd party grids have a alternate "card" or "one record" view.&nbsp; This is the way I've always solved this problem.&nbsp; Bind to the grid and let it handle the 1-record-at-a-time issue.&nbsp;</P>
