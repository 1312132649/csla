<p>I&#39;ve looked through the change log and nothing is jumping out as potential issue so far, and I have it running on my own machine with all my custom CSLA changes ported into it from the previous version.&nbsp; The main thing that I noticed was that the .DLL almost tripled in size since 3.5, but I suspect that&#39;s all the SilverLight support. </p>
<p>I was mainly upgrading to be able to implement IAuthorizeDataPortal. I&#39;ve back-ported a few new features from 3.6 back into 3.5, but this one looks bigger than I would want to do this with. </p>
<p>Has anyone else upgraded to 3.8 lately? Did anything interesting trip you up when you did?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
