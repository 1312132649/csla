<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just looking&nbsp;for a little advice about object design.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm making a CMS of sorts that has generic posts.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The posts come in different types, like news, blog, forum, etc.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Further, the posts belong to threads. Some posts have a null thread ID, so those are the threads themselves, then the posts with the thread ID of that parent post are the comments / replies to that post.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So, should I make a switchable object Post so that it can have children of its own type? Or should I create a Thread object and a Post object?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Further, should&nbsp;I create threads and posts for specific types, like articles or blog posts or forum posts, or just have threads and posts with a type property?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
