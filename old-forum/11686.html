<p>I have a silverlight application that we implemented custom authentication using a custom IPrincipal and IIdentity.&nbsp; My initial test were between two XP machines running IIS.&nbsp; In these these test the ApplicationContext.User flowed back to the server on DataPortal calls.&nbsp; I have deployed the application to a Server 2008 system and now the User object is blank.&nbsp; Its not null but it doesn&#39;t contain any of the user information in it.&nbsp; I have fiddled with some of the settings in IIS7 but nothing seems to change this behavior.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Does anybody have any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The data portal doesn&#39;t do anything fancy. It just serializes the client-side Principal object to the server.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>dblwizard replied on Tuesday, November 13, 2012</h2><p>I discovered that this was not actually related to the IIS 7/2008 but was related to the issue talked about here:</p>

<p>with the optimizer causing issues with public/private properties.&nbsp; The same problem occurred when I built in &quot;Release&quot; mode locally.&nbsp; So it appeared to be an issue when pushing it up to the server but it really wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
