You should be able to find all the object-level metastate on the &quot;object manager&quot; you are using, so you shouldn&#39;t need ObjectStatus.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Tuesday, December 21, 2010</h2><p>Thanks for the fast reply.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never used the ViewModel&lt;T&gt; before.&nbsp; Looking at the forums there is a lot of confusion on this one.&nbsp; It seems like a big piece of architecture to deal with just to&nbsp;databind on&nbsp;IsValid.&nbsp; I&#39;ll dig into it.&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, December 21, 2010</h2><p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>It depends on whether you buy into the MVVM thing or not. I think it is well worth it, but honestly you don&#39;t have to go all the way.</p>
<p>One way or another you should have some &quot;manager&quot; object that gets and saves your object, and you should have a way of making that manager object a resource in your XAML so you can bind to it easily.</p>
<p>ViewModel&lt;T&gt; is a very easy way to create one of these manager objects. And if that&#39;s all you use it for you probably aren&#39;t really doing MVVM, but it will probably still make your life a lot easier :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Tuesday, December 28, 2010</h2><p>So I&#39;ve spent some time today looking at this.&nbsp; The ViewModel&lt;T&gt; doesn&#39;t appear to have any properties for IsValid.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to hook into the framework somewhere so I can raise the&nbsp;INotifyPropertyChanged event when&nbsp;IsValid changes but no luck so far.&nbsp; Am I missing something?&nbsp; It seems like IsValid should already do something like this.&nbsp; I found that I can attached to the BrokenRulesCollection changed but it turns out the IsValid property hasn&#39;t been updated at this point.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
