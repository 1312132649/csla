But i wonder if someone else has experience with any suites. Just for WPF and migratable to Silverlight. We've bought both Infragistics and Telerik, for sure Infragistics is more complete, it has numeric textboxes with masks etc. while telerik only seems to have grid and chart components.<br /><br />- Infragistics<br />http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf.aspx<br /><br />- Telerik<br />http://www.telerik.com/products/wpf.aspx<br /><br />- WPF Toolkit (part of future wpf?)<br />http://wpf.codeplex.com/<br /><br />Does anyone has any experience with the WPF Toolkit in combination with CSLA?<br /><br />Binding info:<br />We aren't using the CslaDataProvider since we use the supervising controller pattern. The CSLA business objects go directly into the DataContext and combolists are bind against an ObjectDataProvider.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>James Thomas replied on Sunday, March 22, 2009</h2>I've been looking at various component suits for silverlight. I think Telerik is probably the most complete - their latest update looks very good. They have a nice grid that seems to handle large datasets well (though their demos aren't bug-free).<br><br>If you're looking at components, it's probably worth trying ComponentOne and possibly ComponentArt (though they are a bit behind others in development, and don't have wpf components) as well as the two you mention. Devexpress do some nice work too.<br><br>Tim Heuer has compiled a list of Silverlight controls. Many of the companies he lists have joint wpf / Silverlight components.<br><br>http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/01/28/comprehensive-list-of-silverlight-controls.aspx<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
