As we start designing data transformations/interchanges in BizTalk, I would like to map to and from business objects ... let them handle the data access themselves, thus insulating the transformation process from the underlying datastore. The whole idea of&nbsp;making BizTalk aware of things like tables and columns leaves me cold.</P>
<P>First: does this make sense in the real world?</P>
<P>Second: what are the best practices around this? One thing I've seen is that our&nbsp;data access code currently&nbsp;includes connection creation and destruction with every insert, update, and delete&nbsp;... fine from a Web page, but not so good for thousands of batched inserts or updates. Do I just need to add alternative "batch" versions of these methods (with appropriate transactional control), or is there more to the puzzle?</P>
<P>Thanks.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom Nedwek replied on Friday, October 26, 2007</h2><P>Putting together conversations with Microsoft and previous posts from Rocky, the best practice seems to be</P>
<UL>
<LI>Wrap business functionality in web services that utilize CSLA-based business objects<BR>(which will effectively isolate Biztalk from the underlying datastore)</LI>
<LI>Create schemas to be used to pass data into and out of these services (as opposed to creating strongly typed service methods)</LI>
<LI>Use XSD.EXE to create XMLSerializable classes to support these schemas.</LI></UL>
