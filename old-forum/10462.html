<p>Right&nbsp;now the behavior appears to be to make no change to the date in the object, and also to leave the wrong date entered&nbsp;in the UI&nbsp; as is.&nbsp; I am wondering if it wouldn&#39;t be more appropriate to provide a signal to the user that the entered value in the text field has been rejected.&nbsp; Since the Property is left unaltered, the BusinessRule system would not work either.</p>
