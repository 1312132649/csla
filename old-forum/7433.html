Now I want to load a list, so I have InvoiceList where the Invoices are created with an internal constructor.  Problem is that these objects are now considered new.  I can't update an invoice, Save() calls DataPortal_Insert instead.  I don't want to have to use DataPortal_Fetch of the Invoice for each invoice, but how can I convince the object that it isn't new? </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>erict2000 replied on Monday, August 10, 2009</h2>Oops -- just found the MarkOld() method.  That seems to be the ticket.  </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
