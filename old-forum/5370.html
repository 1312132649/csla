<P>After careful evaluation, we chose the Wilson ORMapper over NHibernate, mainly because (1)&nbsp;it's implementation is small enough for us to feel comfortable making modifications to, (2) you can use a native SQL dialect versus HQL, and (3) NHibernate generated&nbsp;aliased SQL that would cause performance issues with Oracle -- the aliased parameter names were not generated consistently and varied from client to client and session to sessino. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>andy replied on Thursday, September 11, 2008</h2>I don't anything about Wilson ORMapper to have any comment on it.<br>I did take a quick look at the product.&nbsp; <br>First, it's a commercial product you have to pay for.<br>Second, Seems to me it does play well with odp.net(could be a solution for your performance issues with oracle).<br><br>I have a different view when choosing the ORM framework.<br>&nbsp;1) it should provide the maximum flexibility of object mapping for OOP design <br>2) persistant ignorance <br>3) testability<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
