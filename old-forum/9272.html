<p>When they work they&#39;re great, but if you have to figure out why they&#39;re not working, then they&#39;re a bit of a pain. This happens, as I found out, if the TriggerAction&#39;s DataContext isn&#39;t the ViewModel, but something else. Then you just get a MissingMethodException with the name of the method you&#39;re trying to call.</p>
<p>It would be really helpful if TriggerAction could output a debug message, just like binding errors do indicating what the target object is that it can&#39;t find the method on. That would greatly assist in tracking down XAML issues.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 26, 2010</h2><p>That&#39;s a good idea, I&#39;ll add that to the wish list.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
