You may have to create your own to get the behavior you want - that's what I've had to do in the past anyway...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>PeterRigbye replied on Friday, July 14, 2006</h2><P>I'm afraid Rocky's correct, this is one of the biggest pains in my opinion trying to deliver Windows-like functionality in a web browser.</P>
<P>You will need a 3rd-party control (or suite). We've used the webcombo product from Intersoft for the past three years, but there are quite a few others on the market.</P>
<P>I did see an atricle recently on using Atlas/AJAX to achieve similar results without buying a control, but never got to try it out.</P>
