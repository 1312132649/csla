<P>If so , perhaps you can help me out. I am trying to get the UltraWebGrid working with a CSLADataSource.</P>
<P>The DataSource_SelectObject is firing when the grids requests data and the DataSource_InsertObject fires when a rows is added to the gris after the Grid_AddRow fires.</P>
<P>However the DataSource_UpdateObject and DataSource_DeleteObject never seem to get fired when a row is updated or deleted.</P>
<P>Any advice or pointers in the right direction would be most welcomed.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
<P>Bill</P>
