I definitely saw that the links exist within the proj file. I could swear I ran into problems with VSS when I tried to introduce a first linked file and so I figured this must be a feature not necessarily supported in most source control products.<br /><br />So it sounds like this is probably a non-issue then. Thanks. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Friday, October 16, 2009</h2>subversion works pretty well, especially if you are on the latest patches and using the ankh visual studio plugin and of course tortoise.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, October 16, 2009</h2>I like SourceGear's Fortress / Vault product.  Not too expensive, sql server backend for storage, and their support has been great.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cds replied on Friday, October 16, 2009</h2>I'm using SVN - works perfectly fine.<br /><br />Re the linked files in the projects, I had some intentions of looking at writing a VS plug-in to assist with this. E.g. build a plug-in that monitored specific folders in a project and then automatically added new files to the corresponding folders as links. Just a dream though for when I get a spare moment...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, October 19, 2009</h2>Hi, <br><br>a VS plugin for linked files between projects is already available from P&amp;P with full source code here: <br><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=fa07e1ce-ca3f-4b9b-a21b-e3fa10d013dd&amp;displaylang=en%20">Composite Application Guidance for WPF and Silverlight - February 2009</a><br><br>Download the installer MicrosoftPracticesProjectLinkerFeb2009.msi or full source code ProjectLinkerSourceFeb2009.exe.<br><br>You will also find some information on <a href="http://compositewpf.codeplex.com">http://compositewpf.codeplex.com</a> <br><font size="2"><i>=========================<br>Project linker â€“ Overview<br>=========================<br><br>The
approach we are taking for multi-targeting is to provide guidance on
structuring application and module code into multiple linked projects.
Each project manages all of the references, resources and code specific
to the WPF or Silverlight target environment.<br>The Project Linker is
a tool that helps creating and maintaining links from a source project
to a target project to share code that is common to Silverlight and
WPF. Therefore shared code can be written once and built for the target
environment.<br>Filters can be specified to avoid linking every file,
this is useful if you are writing Silverlight or WPF specific code. For
example you can filter out all files that have a defined prefix.<br><br>To
link a source project to a target project, right click the source
project and select "Add Project Link". In the window that pops up
select the target project and click OK.</i><br></font>  <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cds replied on Monday, October 19, 2009</h2>Wow... that sounds very cool!
