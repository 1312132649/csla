<p>I see you are doing a session this weekend called &#39;<a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/Sessions.aspx#s32">Build a Silverlight App with CSLA 4</a>&#39;.&nbsp; I am not going to be able to make it to that, any chance you can put the session, or at least the materials, online for those of us who can&#39;t make it?</p>
<p>I am going to be starting a Silverlight app using CSLA 4 and would love to be able to attend this session, but it&#39;s not going to work.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Wednesday, October 06, 2010</h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-family:mceinline;">I wish that Rocky video taped as many of his presentations as possible and made them available on the CSLA website.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-family:mceinline;">Of course, it&rsquo;s easy for me to suggest such thing since I am not the one taking the time to tape and post the videos. When I go to the .Net user groups here in Dallas, I pretty much always see an organization called INETA that records most if not all of the session presented so they take care of that nasty leg work. Not sure if they are willing to share the videos they record though.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-family:mceinline;">By the way, Rocky, do you ever visit Dallas (or some place close)? Dallas is never in your presentation list, what&rsquo;s up with that?? <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-9.gif" alt="Crying" /></span><br /></span></p>

As with most things this is more complex than it might first appear.</p>
<p>Things like code camps aren&#39;t so bad, but I usually get paid to speak, and so on one hand don&#39;t want to give away for free what otherwise pays the bills. Also when a conference pays me to speak they don&#39;t want me to give the content away for free either (usually).</p>
<p>But code camps are a community-building effort. Donated time and effort to make the community stronger - and of course to market my paid content and Magenic&#39;s services. I&#39;d love to be completely altruistic, but that&#39;s not the world we live in.</p>
<p>My code camp demos are, or will be, in the CSLA 4 Samples download. I don&#39;t plan to have many (any?) slides, since I can easily fill the time walking through the demos. So I think it is safe to say that the CSLA community will have full access to the assets from the presentations via the Samples download.</p>
<p>Specifically the Samples\NET\cs\SimpleNTier remains simple, but now includes numerous types of interface (in the 4.1 release), including a Silverlight UI, and (by this weekend) an ASP.NET MVC UI.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Gort replied on Thursday, October 07, 2010</h2><p>Makes sense, Rocky.&nbsp; Thanks for your efforts.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jradxl replied on Thursday, October 07, 2010</h2><p>Rocky,<br />Funny you should ask... There&#39;s Software Architect 2010 in London on 19th - 22nd Oct. (www.software-architect.co.uk)&nbsp; It&#39;s terrible you&#39;ve not been asked to speak!! <br /><br />Devon, Cornwall is a great area of the UK - hope you make it soon</p>

<p>Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco get some opportunities each year, because Magenic flies me there for various things, and if I can arrange a community event (or tap into an existing one) I do so.</p>
<p>INETA used to fly me around to user groups, but their budget realities are quite different now and that isn&#39;t in the cards.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to come to Dallas, for example, because I have friends who live there that I&#39;d love to visit. But in the end it comes down to having some event covering the cost of having me fly there to speak. That&#39;s true of a great many places around the country (and the world for that matter).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jradxl replied on Wednesday, October 06, 2010</h2><p>When are you going to come to the UK?</p>

<p>I was just in Germany, and will be in Norway next May - both for regional conferences that brought me in as a speaker. Are there any such conferences in the UK?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
