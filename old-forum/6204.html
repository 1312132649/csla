<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>.ClientConfig has to be created by hand for CSLA SL application s
because the reference to the server is handled by CSLA and you do not need to
add your own reference.&nbsp; As a result, your .CLientConfig file will never be
created by the VS IDE, hence you have to do it by hand.&nbsp; Then again I
always start by copying one from another project and changing port number<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Both XML configuration files are to support cross domain access,
since WCF host is running on a different port then the SL web
application.&nbsp; Without those file you will get security exceptions.&nbsp; Those
files are needed by IIS to support cross domain WCF calls made by SL application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>I am getting further in my Silverlight prototype and I think my problem now
lies in understanding Wcf within the Rolodex example.&nbsp; I noticed that
WcfHostWeb project on the Web properties page has a specific port of
2430.&nbsp; My understanding is that this is the port to which communication
with the business objects in the Rolodex.Business.Server is accomplished.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I noticed that the Rolodex application project has the file
ServiceReferences.ClientConfig file and it references the port of 2430.&nbsp; I
noticed there was not a ServiceReferences reference added to the project.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>My question is, was the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig file created by hand
and the stuff was entered because the port was mentioned specifically on the
Web properties page of the WcfHostWeb project?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Also, I noticed that the WcfHostWeb properties has a Settings.settings file
under it and I do not.&nbsp; I have the items in the Web.config file so I
thought when the project was built, the Settings.settings would be created, but
they are not.&nbsp; Could someone shed some light on this for me.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Also, what are the files clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml
for?&nbsp; I included those, but I am not sure what they are for.&nbsp; I
figured they must be important so I included them.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Any help with the above questions would be most appreciated and I am making
amazing progress in my understanding of Silverlight and Wcf.&nbsp; Read a lot
of Michele Leroux Bustamante's book and Matthew MacDonald's book on Silverlight
2 and felt good about the material.&nbsp; But got tired of reading and just
wanted to &quot;dig in&quot; and beat my head against the wall to figure things
out.&nbsp; After I get more things figured out, it will be time to get back to
the books.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Thanks for all your help so far Rocky, Sergey and all others who have helped
me.&nbsp; I hope to help some other folks when I get things figured out!<o:p></o:p></p>
