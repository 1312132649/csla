I know that a number of us have been using the SCSF and CSLA successfully for some time.&nbsp;Now that the latest version of the SCSF has come out, I thought it would be amusing to convert the Project Tracker WinForm example to use the SCSF so that I could learn about its new features.</P>
<P>I have published the details on CodeProject for anyone who is interested and it is available <A href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/SCSF_CSLA_ProjectTracker.asp">here</A>. This may help anyone who is thinking of using this collection of&nbsp;technologies.</P>
<P>Experience developers here will have a good laugh at the amount of overhead that this approach gives rise to. Equally it does demonstrate the power of a composite approach.</P>
<P>If anyone is interested, you can see how I have used CSLA and the earlier versions of SCSF in my application <A href="http://www.straitonsoftware.com/">here</A>.</P>
