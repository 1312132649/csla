<P>I'd want full control so can get CSLA working and configured, plus some a small amount of database space for SQL 2008 hosting (or SQL 2005).<BR><BR>It is really just to create a personal / demo site of my skills and CSLA experience, so needs to be cheap.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

May be that's what you mean by full control. Shared hosts always (or at least should) run medium trust so you can't run CSLA. A virtual private server is probably the best option. You can get a low cost Windows VPS at <A href="http://www.jodohost.com">http://www.jodohost.com</A>&nbsp;although I have not tried one so I don't know how good they are. I'm happy with Jodo's shared hosting. Their VPSs&nbsp;come with access to&nbsp;SQL Server on another machine.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 03, 2009</h2><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/WebFormsFaq.ashx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/WebFormsFaq.ashx</A></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tetranz replied on Wednesday, June 03, 2009</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/WebFormsFaq.ashx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/WebFormsFaq.ashx</a></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>Rocky, I know it's hardly worth the minute or so to fix but FWIW the webhost4life link on that page is missing the http:// so it's coming through as relative.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Thursday, June 04, 2009</h2>Excellent - thanks for the links.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
