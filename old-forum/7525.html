I override AddNewCore method in BLB class.<br /><br />All is working, but I discovered a strange behaviour when I' m trying to delete a row from gridex, other than the last one. <br />If the operation is saved, this row is removed from DeletedList and from database. <br />If I undo this operation, the deleted row is added on the last position of gridex, not in the initial position.<br /><br />I'm using properly RebindUI method in user interface.<br /><br /><br />Thanks</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
