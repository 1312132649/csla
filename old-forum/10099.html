<p>On <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Access</em> you use a single DAL interface and thus a single class for handling the persistence of two objects: PersonEdit and PersonList.</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t this a violation of the Single Responsability principle?</p>
<p>Anyway, why use a single DAL class?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 23, 2011</h2><p>The DAL interfaces are providing services for a data entity, not for a business object. </p>
<p>PersonEdit and PersonList are business objects with separate responsibilities, but they both use data from the underlying &quot;person data entity&quot;, and that&#39;s a singular concept.</p>
<p>The IPersonDal DAL interface&nbsp;is focused on the data entity, not the business object(s).</p>
<p>You might look at this differently, and have different DAL interfaces for each business object. That&#39;s also a valid perspective on the problem. I just don&#39;t typically approach it that way.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
