A friend recommended it and I am reading through Expert Business Objects right now. I have downloaded the latest code and am trying to figure it out. I have found a post which helped with the build of cslacs solution, which I have now compiled. However, what is the deal with the "Deploy" solution, do I need it? What does it do? I would like any productivity/VS add-ins, it looks like it may contain those. When I try to build it though, I am getting one error and one warning:<br /><br />Error: Error	2	Cannot find outputs of project output group '(unable to determine name)'.  Either the group, its configuration, or its project may have been removed from the solution.

C:\Users\JoshPeltier\Documents\My Dropbox\VS Projects\cslacs-3.8.1-091111\Source\cslacs\deploy\Setup\Setup.vdproj	Setup<br /><br /><br />I am using VS2010 Beta 2, so that could be an issue too. Any other tips for getting up and running would be greatly appreciated!  <br /><br />Hope all are having a great thankgiving weekend!<br /><br />Josh</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sacha barber replied on Thursday, December 31, 2009</h2>I am having exact same issue with ALL the new versions. I thought it may be something to do with not having ASP MVC framework installed, so I tried that, and it still does not work.<br /><br />Whats up with it, how do we get it to build the Setp (which I consider to be almost the most important thing of all)<br /><br />Have a look at this issue screenshot<br /><br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2600965/CSLA%20Error.png" /><br /><br />So just for a laugh lets remove that (more than likely very vital item from the Setup), and then try and recompile it again and we get the following:<br /><br />Warning	1	All custom dialogs must precede the 'Installation Folder' dialog.	C:\Users\sacha\Desktop\Downloads\cslacs-3.8.2-091210\cslacs\deploy\Setup\Setup.vdproj	Setup<br />Error	2	'PreBuildEvent' failed with error code '1' 'Unspecified error'	C:\Users\sacha\Desktop\Downloads\cslacs-3.8.2-091210\cslacs\deploy\Setup\Setup.vdproj	Setup<br /><br /><br />Also in the cslacs-3.8.2-091210.zip there are 3 unloaded projects:<br /><br />1. CslaLight<br />2. Cslacs.Test<br />3. CslaLight.Testing.Server<br /><br />I should also mention that I too am using VS2010 beta 2, and have ASP .NET MVC installed.<br /><br />The same thing happens with all 3.8.1 and even going back as far as 3.6.0 I can not get  the thing installed (other problems missing projects for those)<br /><br />What is going on, any chance this could be resolved?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, December 31, 2009</h2>I don't think you need the installation projects; I would just remove them from the solution.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
