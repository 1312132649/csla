<P>I'm able to "get around" this via code like this.Items.Remove(item).&nbsp; So I guess I have two questions. 1) is it meant to be like this or am I just messing something up? 2) if it is supposed to work like this.... why?&nbsp; Why should the underlying framework decide I never want to remove a root item from a collection?</P>
<P>For a little background.&nbsp; I'm hitting this issue in my code doing something very simliar to ActiveObjects.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, when this item is deleted an event is raised in any collections subscribing to type of event on that type of objects.&nbsp; If the current collection has a reference to that item which was just deleted, I want to remove that reference.</P>
<P>Anyone have any thoughts on this?</P><FONT size=1>
