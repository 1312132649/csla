<p>I need to associate the Email with the Contact from whom it originated.&nbsp; Contacts do not have Folders. I need to make the Email appear logically in mutliple Folders (associated with Employees), but for obvious reasons, I don&#39;t want to physycally replicate the Email data row everytime it gets &quot;added&quot; to a Contact or an Employee&#39;s Folder.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am wondering whether implementing Email as a Dynamic object is the way to go.&nbsp; I would then implement a property of type EmailList in the Contact and Folder objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am wondering is, can I then create Email as a root, but then add it to whatever EmailList collections I subsequently associate it with?</p>

<p>&nbsp;I decided to go with a many-to-many solution, modelled after ProjectResources in PTracker.&nbsp; Simpler in my case, since I only need to manage the owner-email associations from the owner side.&nbsp; I will leave Email as a ER.</p>
