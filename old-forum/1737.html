<P>I have&nbsp; a&nbsp;PayRun Collection which contain Pays with a Summary. Now how can I access&nbsp;a property TotalGross in the PaySummary from a Gridview which is set to the Pays Level. I can see the Summary as a field but not the individual propertys</P>
<P>Help</P>

Personally I use Infragistics' Grid which can show an arbitrary number of 'bands' of data. <br><br>With standdard WinForms controls I guess that the following are your options:<br>- master-detail view setup, you will have some view on the sideline that tracks the currently selected row in your master grid and displays additional details like the TotalGross. (ugly, I know)<br>- you take care of databinding manually, then you can wire your object-properties to individual columns programmatically (nasty, cumbersome, .... )<br>- use a treeview (does not support databinding, so it's a variation of the previous option, nasty again)<br>- create additional properties on your Pays BO that wrap the properties on your TotalGross child object (also ugly, but at least you can leave regular databinding in place)<br><br>In the past I used the regular winforms grid like everybody else .... but after a year of frustration I bought the Infragistics NetAdvantage kit (comes at a price slightly under thousand dollars I believe). As a result I haven't been using the WinForms grid control for quite a while now. I do believe that the options I listed are the ones available to you, but I may be incomplete. <br><br>Given the high degree of undesirability in my suggestions I surely hope someone will pop a more elegant solution.<br><br>Good luck,<br>Bayu<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Wal972 replied on Saturday, November 11, 2006</h2>How about with ASP.Net any suggestions ?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
