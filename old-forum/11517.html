That is where you&#39;d see the error from the DoSave method.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>st3fanus replied on Monday, August 06, 2012</h2><p>Hi rocky ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks a lot :)</p>
<p>yes, i forgot to catch the error, NOW the BO can be saved.</p>
<p>But in this case, i have something that i understand,</p>
<p>First, My First Error is : I forgot to mark Serializable on said it PaymentEdit BO, after i mark it it can be saved, i have check it on DB</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>The second problem arise : it still display an error that said MyDal have to be mark as Serializable too ( I don&#39;t know why this happen )</p>
<p>as long as I know Dal is run on server side, not travel from client to server or vice versa, Am I right ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I missing something ? because my another BO is no ask about mark serializable on their DAL ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p>

<p>If you need this as a property then remember to keep it as a private backing field marked with [NotUndoable] and [NonSerialized] attributes.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
