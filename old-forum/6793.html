<P>Many months ago I was looking for a good Object Data Source model&nbsp;for ASP.NET grids and other components. After looking closely at Manuel Abadia's notes I happened to find that&nbsp;the Object Data Source for CSLA was very good because it provides an excellent design-time schema definition. I looked into CSLA, decided I wanted a code generator,&nbsp;but&nbsp;got a bit discouraged looking at CodeBreeze. I then detoured&nbsp;to CodeSmith where I got interested in .NetTiers and wrote my own data provider for a custom data source. But that effort still requires extensive work. I want to come back to basics.</P>
<P>CSLA is "deep" and I don't think I need the whole thing. Rather than using a major framework, I'm wondering if all I really need is a good ODS.&nbsp;The requirements for using the CSLA ODS&nbsp;are nested in the details of the framework and I find it difficult to figure out just which classes would be required for minimal use.&nbsp; I have written a code generator for Visual Studio so that I can generate classes based on templates after pointing to my data source. I'm just wondering that the minimum requirements would be.</P>
<P>The goal is to generate an ODS, and use it at design time as a data source for visual components which extract schema (for auto-populating columns, etc).&nbsp; The next step would be to handle runtime CRUD operations, paging, filtering, etc.&nbsp; Yeah, I know, it's a lot.</P>
<P>Again, please forgive some noobishness here. It's been a while since I've approached this topic and it will take a while to re-familiarize. The final answer might just be to dive into the deep water and re-learn how to swim.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Starbuck replied on Saturday, April 18, 2009</h2><P>Never Mind. I just implemented the full CSLA library.&nbsp; From the stunning&nbsp;lack of response&nbsp;I'm guessing this was the right thing to do from the start.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, April 20, 2009</h2>Whew!<br />Glad you figured it out on your own! <br /><br />Your original question was too "far from the beaten path" to dive in to. <br /><br />Joe</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
