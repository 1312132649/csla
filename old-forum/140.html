<DIV align=left><FONT><SPAN class=078132119-18052006>Perhaps this is an 
unnecessary restriction?&nbsp; The parent isn't going to be making any changes

right?&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<DIV align=left><FONT><SPAN class=078132119-18052006>If so, you could 
consider making the hyperlinks a <STRONG>Public</STRONG> ROOT Collection 
object.&nbsp; You can make it filterable, of course, and when an object of 
ClassA uses it, they could just build a <STRONG>Private</STRONG> Clone of it 
(shouldn't be another db call, right?) and filter by the projecct guid of ObjA - 
same for Obj B.&nbsp; Then the list is always initialized and ready for whoever 
needs it.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<DIV align=left><FONT><SPAN class=078132119-18052006>If there really is 
a need for the "parent" object to make changes to these children, this won't be 
a useful idea, of course.</SPAN></FONT></DIV><BR>

<P>I don't know exactly how to explain this, so here is the first round:</P>
<P>I have a project that joins together at least two&nbsp;object types ObjA and 
ObjB. Each one needs a collection of hyperlinks to internal resources. I'm 
trying to make the collection as generic as possible, but as children, they need 
to know their parents. I definitely want to load the collection with the project 
without another db call.</P>
<P>Right now I have a root and collection class&nbsp;for each of the starting 
points. They store the Guid (from ObjA, ObjB...), DocumentID, Document 
Description, Created Date, CreatorID and&nbsp;CategoryID. The Guid is the id for 
the projects, everything else is pretty standard for all links.</P>
<P>Problem: the&nbsp;are initialized independantly of eachother for workflow 
reasons, so I can't say ObjB uses ObjA always or vice versa. No "build on this" 
scenario would fit.</P>
<P>What would be a mechnism to use to create the link so the lusers won't resent 
using the app?</P>
<P>_E</P><BR><BR><BR></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>esteban404 replied on Thursday, May 18, 2006</h2><P>I think there is need for the parent to make the changes as the links directly relate to it. I think I may need to create a constructor internal to them all so I can pass the parent identity when it exists. That would work in a couple places, but not all.</P>
<P>A situation is a Setup Project can be initiated, but then the Designers get involved. How to get the design project to use the same links? What I've done thus far is use a "new Design" event inside the SetupProject editor (I've discovered my&nbsp;users love clicking things and pop up stuff). That's the only way I could think of using it. I've asked the designers if that's OK, but they balked. It's a coder/user issue I'm sure. I'll put together a demo and get their feedback. I think it could work fine.</P>
<P>I'll just&nbsp;give it a couple of days while working on GUI&nbsp;skutt work and i'll I'll get it if I have to take a couple of users down with me! :-]</P>
<P>Thanks for the reply, Q</P>
