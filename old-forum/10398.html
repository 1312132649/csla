<p>Are you working on the Silverlight Mvvm or ASP.Net MVC eBook next?&nbsp; I&#39;m keen on getting my hands on the Silverlight one first so was wondering when a first draft would be available.</p>
<p>The sample code from the Data Access and Dataportal configuration projects is really helping my understanding though, but just need a bit more around the Mvvm + Bxf interaction.&nbsp; I love the sample code where you can plug in a mock database for testing, or alternate datasources.&nbsp; Very cool.</p>
<p>I&#39;m about to start a Silverlight project and am finding that the main area I need to get up to speed on is the Mvvm and navigation model, and Blend of course - which is hard not having a designers brain :-)</p>
<p>Thanks to CSLA.Net and all your&#39;s and others work, I really don&#39;t need to worry about too much else these days.</p>
<p>If the book is a few months away, would the Mvvm video be a good reference - I&#39;m guessing it is?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard.</p>

<p>Next I will work on the WPF/SL book. The books are taking 3-4 weeks to complete, so that would be the end of June.</p>
<p>The MVVM video series is a good reference, yes. The WPF/SL book will cover much the same content as the video series.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
