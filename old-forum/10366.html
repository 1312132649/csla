<p>Originally I had subclassed BusinessBase.&nbsp; After reading the CSAL4 book, I subclassed CriteriaBase, but still no luck.&nbsp; Then I remembered using a Criteria class for something many months ago, and that one had been working ever since.&nbsp; I though I&#39;ll take a look.&nbsp; The only difference I found was a Public Criteria() { } sitting the in the class.</p>
<p>Not expecting anything particular, I added the same into my new Criteria class - and boom thare it was.&nbsp; My lonely little DataPortal_Fetch(MyCriteria crit) had a hit.&nbsp; Yea!!&nbsp; Was it just a fluke, or was this what was sorely needed all along?&nbsp; That&#39;s the question.</p>

<p>Because I&#39;ve been doing so much SL/WP7, I have taken to always implementing public default constructors (actually I almost never implement any constructors, so the compiler creates the public default ctor).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Saturday, May 14, 2011</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b>so the compiler creates the public default ctor</div></p>
<p>For some reason, the compiler was not creating the default constructor in my Criteria class - or so it seems.&nbsp; I used to always add a default public constructor.&nbsp; Then about a month ago I started using CodeRush - a pesky little add-on which has been driving me nuts.&nbsp; One of its pet goals in life is to make me remove all Default Public constructors. (The other is to keep telling me&nbsp;that I do not need to import Csla.Serialization)</p>
