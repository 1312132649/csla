<p>Software: CSLA 4.1 &ndash; VS2010</p>
<p>After I have read the CSLA Expert C# 2008 Business Objects, watched CSLA 4 MVVM Video Series and practiced some CSLA with WinForm, I &lsquo;m testing myself to create a small WPF demo in order to understand the basics (MVVM pattern) before starting the serious project.</p>
<p>I have chosen to develop in WPF, because the future application will need to interact with a client-side peripheral and you use a client-side database.</p>
<p>Here my issue: I have tried to design a small demo by inspiration of the the SLDemo but without success so far. I have spent almost 2 day to found out what I&rsquo;m doing wrong. Its looks like that the XAML form is not bind with the ViewModel. So, I have got no presentation data and the triggerActions dont call any methods (Save, Cancel).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering is someone could have a look at the code attached below to teach me what I&rsquo;m missing, or send me a small app sample (WPF/MVVP) to learn how to make it right.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance for your help,</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Take a closer look at the way Rocky sets the DataContext in the SIDemo project.&nbsp; I think that will get you on your way.&nbsp; Sorry about the brevity but I&#39;m at work.</p>

<p>It looks like you are missing some key components MVVM. I think that CSLA MVVMexperiment sample maybe helpful to you.</p>
<p>Also the projecttracker is a very good sample. </p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

Actually, the big problem was from my poor understanding of xaml binding.</p>
