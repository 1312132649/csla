I assume the purpose of timezone in my profile is to show me correct time, but it's off. Perhaps something to do with US DST?</P>
<P>P.S. We don't have DST anytime in Singapore. The sun shines 12 hrs every day from 7 till 7<img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 09, 2006</h2><P>Those 12 hour days must be nice <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></P>
<P>Perhaps this is a bug in CS 2.0, or in .NET's time handling - I don't know. You can always search communityserver.org to see if it is a CS bug.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
