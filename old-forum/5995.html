<P>One possible hurdle is that CSLA out of the box only supports a single data portal, so that if you are fetching or persisting objects into two or more places, it can get interesting. </P>
<P>You may need to come up with a scheme where something about the BO class itself determines where the data is stored. </P>
<P>I've also made a slight modification to CSLA to support dynamic data portals, with the type of the BO being used to determine which data portal to use. In my specific case, I was trying to share our application library with a new disconnectable application, so the application libary is accessed via a web service or remote portal, and the local application data is forced through the local data portal. It works great. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Wednesday, December 17, 2008</h2><P>I work in an environment with multiple product families each containing multiple products and we try to reuse code as much as possible and appropriate.</P>
<P>To accomplish this, we have a tiered structure for our framework libraries:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Acme</STRONG> - all code that is product &amp; family independant that is shared across the company.&nbsp; This is where we build upon CSLA.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Acme.Web</STRONG> - product &amp; familiy independant code for Web apps (common controls, etc.)</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Acme.Windows</STRONG> - same for WinForms apps</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Acme.Wpf</STRONG> - you get the point<BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Acme.ProductFamily</STRONG> - code that is shared between all products within a family.&nbsp; Builds upon Acme</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Acme.ProductFamily.Web</STRONG> - builds on Acme.Web with stuff shared by the product family.</LI>
<LI>etc.<BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Acme.ProductFamily.Product</STRONG> - application specific stuff.&nbsp; Builds upon Acme.ProductFamily</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Acme.ProductFamily.Product.Web</STRONG> - web application for the product (if applicable).&nbsp; Uses the Acme.ProductFamily.Product and Acme.ProductFamily.Web libraries.</LI></UL>
<P>This is, of course, just one way to build out your framework to support reuse.&nbsp; What's nice about this approach is that we implement from the highest level down.&nbsp; This means that we first develop for the application that requires the behavior then, as we identify needs to share, that code can move down into the framework as we feel is appropriate.</P>
<P>(Replace Acme with Microsoft, ProductFamily with Office and Product with Word if that helps.)</P>
