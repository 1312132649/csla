That makes their support very difficult to deal with, because to prove it really is their code, you need to come up with your own pure .Net code to demonstrate the problem.  Even then it takes FOREVER for them to actually get a fix available.  <br /><br />One issue I reported in Nov and it took six weeks before a hotfix was available.  Fortunately that issue was not a show stopper for me.<br /><br />Two other issues which were show stoppers for me (ie, to release I'd have to remove their controls) I reported end of Dec, and a hot fix was not available until Mid April (and at that time the 20091 versions were released too).  Fortunately my release got pushed back quite a bit at the same time, so I didn't have to remove the controls before their fixes came out.<br /><br />If I had to choose between Csla and their controls, I'd pick Csla.  I think other vendors have been a bit more Csla friendly, but search the forum to be sure.<br /><br />That said, when things DO work, they work well together, and that is the normal case.  I've used their Win controls very extensively, followed by their Wpf controls (all of the issues above were relating to their Wpf controls).  Their Asp.Net controls I haven't used in a while, but I also had a much more difficult time with them than Winforms controls.  I suspect I'll be working with them again soon, since I have to go back to that Asp.Net project.<br /><br />So, that's my two cents.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Thursday, April 30, 2009</h2>Also, thanks to both of you for taking the time to go into detail, that helps a lot <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, April 30, 2009</h2>I have a large web app and use Infragistics for Charts and Gauges. They work very nicely. I have the rest of their controls but have never implemented them in ASP.Net. The phone support for Charts and Gauges was excellent. <br /><br />They broke their own code when upgrading from ver 7 to ver 8. When I pointed them to the exact issue it took over 4 months to get a hotfix. I had already worked around the issue but ...<br /><br />Joe</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Thursday, April 30, 2009</h2>Thanks Joe.&nbsp; hmmm, 4 months is not ideal as a response time!&nbsp; I've used theMindFusion flowcharting controls extensively and when I've pointed out bugs to them they normally have a patch ready in about 2 days!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, May 01, 2009</h2>Heh.. well I just submitted a report for WinForms.  Should be interesting to see how long that takes.  They already got back to me with a workaround... so I don't know if they'll fix it or not :-/</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
