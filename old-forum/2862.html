<P>Have you tried running the projecttracker sample app? Have you confirmed that your web server is set up property (runs aspx/asmx pages)? Have you tried a simple remoting "hello world" scenario to ensure remoting works properly at a basic level? You realize your web server is running .NET 1.1 - is that the version of .NET being used by your app?</P>
<P>This is not an error message I can recall anyone posting about before, which is probably why you aren't getting a lot of response. Have you searched <A href="http://www.searchcsla.com">www.searchcsla.com</A> to see if someone did post about it years ago?</P>
<P>99.9999% of the time, the reason for remoting failures is due to IIS configuration, ASP.NET configuration, project reference, web.config or app.config errors (with config file typos being the biggest issue).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>geordiepaul replied on Tuesday, May 15, 2007</h2><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hi,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I have seen something similar to this. Have to tried deleting everything from your temporary asp.net files folder? I seem to remember that solved it for me. Must admit it wasn't a 1.1 issue so it may not solve your problem.</FONT></P>
