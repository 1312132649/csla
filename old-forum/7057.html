<P>Also, both the <EM>Business Object Types</EM> and <EM>N-Tier Data Access</EM> videos (segments 5 and 6) can now be purchased separately, as each of these segments contains information valuable to any CSLA .NET developer.</P>
<P>Segment 6 details the various options supported by CSLA .NET for data access in n-tier scenarios. Watching this video, you will learn how to put data access code into your business class, or into a separate data access assembly, along with the pros and cons of each technique. You will also learn about the ObjectFactory attribute and base class, that can be used to create pluggable data access layers for an application.</P>
<P>This video is 1 hour and 49 minutes in length, so you can imagine just how much great content exists!</P>
<P>Not only does the video talk about editable objects and child objects and lists, it covers the common parent-child-grandchild scenario.</P>
<P>And it includes data access code using raw ADO.NET (for performance and long-term stability) as well as a complete walkthrough using ADO.NET Entity Framework as a data access layer.</P>
<P>The <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/ct.ashx?id=0830c6ae-6c93-4b42-8979-1e7dc42ab452&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fstore.lhotka.net%2f"><FONT color=#669966>pre-release purchase offer</FONT></A> of <STRONG>$50 off the regular price</STRONG> of $300 is still available. If you buy before June 20, your price is $250 for the entire video series, and you get the first 6 (of 7) video segments, nearly 7 hours of content, immediately!</P>
<P>And again, you can purchase segments 5 and 6 individually if you are not interested in the complete Silverlight video series.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GregDobbs replied on Saturday, June 06, 2009</h2>Hello, Rocky.<br /><br />As usual, you've done an extraordinary job in putting together the Silverlight video series.<br /><br />Do you plan to augment that with any written documentation on the topics covered? I have always found your books to be the fastest and best source of quick go-to information when I need to see how something's implemented in the framework.<br /><br />Thanks for your great work!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, June 06, 2009</h2>I may, though probably not until SL 3.<br /><br />Different people learn different ways. Some learn best through reading,<br />others through listening, others through doing. I'm trying different formats<br />of content, and hopefully will end up with a good mix that makes everyone<br />reasonably happy :)<br /><br />Rocky</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Saturday, June 06, 2009</h2>Awesome, I will purchase this one too.&nbsp; Rocky, if you have it, could you post the list of topics and approx. start times (like the one you did for Segment 5).<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, June 06, 2009</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I&#8217;ll try to do a list of topics when I get a chance. I got
the video up late on Friday right before I left for a camping trip, so I didn&#8217;t

Thanks, Rocky.<br /><br />Here are notes on what I needed to do to get the sample code files to compile and run on my system.<br />1. Use CSLA v3.6.3. My system had 3.6.2, and the method signatures did not match for the adding custom validation using a method in the object. Note it is a relative reference to the CSLA directories, so if the location isn't the same you may need to drop and re-add the references to CSLA.<br />2. Drop and re-add the reference to Systems.Windows.Controls.Data. Not sure why, but that one reference was consistently broken.<br />3. My system has SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition, not SQLExpress. The connection string in Web.config had to be modified. <br />3a. Replace ".\SQLEXPRESS" (the instance name) with "localhost".<br />3b. Replace "|DataDirectory|" with the actual directory path to the DemoDb.mdf file. Using "|DataDirectory|" was giving an error that replacing with the full path resolved.<br />3c. Remove "User Instance=True;". Its not used by SQL Server 2005.<br /><br />Hope that is helpful.<br /><br />mbb</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Tuesday, June 16, 2009</h2>Finally got a moment to watch this video and it is superb.&nbsp; Specific notes:<br><ul><li>Thoroughly recommended to anyone learning the CSLA framework basics and also to anyone who wants to understand how all the different MS data access technologies (Linq to SQL, ADO, EF etc) relate to one another.</li><li>The parent/child/grandchild walkthrough is a great help</li><li>There is almost no Silverlight specific content in this one.</li><li>As before the production and Rocky's presentation are first class.</li><li>This video will save you a *lot* of time if you are just starting out with CSLA.<br></li></ul></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
