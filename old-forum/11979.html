The WCFconfig uses the standard &#39;wsHttpBinding&#39; binding with no compression.</p>
<p>Recently whilst testing a new app I started seeing strange exceptions whenever the remote client attempted to save data to the app server. I traced the issue down to the default 8MB limit that IIS placec on transfers.</p>
<p>The remote client was actually parsing some csv and xml files to create a list of dirty objects, so it was fairly easy to creat a large set of dirty objects. I was able to work around the problem by&nbsp; breaking up the upload into several smaller chunks, I noticed something that has raised my curiosity.</p>
<p>I never saw issues when retreiving data from the app server, even though the retrieved data&nbsp; contained exactly the same objects that weretoo large to save (upload). Using Fidler I saw that the size of the uploaded data (dirty objects) was around 10x the size of the retrieved (downloaded) data (I undid the chunking for the tests).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a reason for this discrepancy in size?</p>
<p>Is there any safe way to reduce the upload size?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
