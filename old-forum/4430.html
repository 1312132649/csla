<P>When I run the ProjectTracker application I see all of these "ASP.NET Development server" icons&nbsp;in my system tray.&nbsp; Why do these appear?&nbsp; And are all of them necessary?&nbsp; I would have expected only one to show up based on the remote host I've chosen to use, in this case WCF.&nbsp; Is there something in the App.config file that I need to comment out?</P>
<P>Thanks in advance for your comments :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, February 28, 2008</h2><P>I think the dev server connects to a random port each time you run the app.</P>
<P>So you can just Exit out of the one in your tray when you are done running the app.</P>
<P>That way they won't "build up".</P>

<P>Well, on to the next issue :)</P>
<P>Thanks again.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
