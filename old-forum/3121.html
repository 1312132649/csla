<P>The issue I'm having is how to specify the subclassed child collection.&nbsp; If I leave it defined in the core or base class, it then references the core library's child collection ( and related child objects ).&nbsp; If I define the collection in the subclassed object it references the correct child collection and related child objects, but I believe that I will then have to move the DataPortal code from the base class to the subclass so that updates are operating on the proper collection.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Ideally, I would like to leave the definition of the child collection in the base class and then override it somehow... Not sure if this is possible... </P>
<P>Anyway, would anyone have an example of how to inherit an editable root &amp; editable child collection?</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>

<P>Create an interface (eg IChild) that contains an IChildUpdate method (and possibly each DP Method)</P>
<P>In your base class:&nbsp; When you define the child collection in the base class, define&nbsp;it&nbsp;as a collection containing&nbsp;IChild elements.&nbsp; In the DataPortal code in the base class call the IChildUpdate method for each child.</P>
<P>The inheriting child class must impliment this IChild interface, and in the IChildUpdate method specify the DataPortal code.</P>
<P>Keep in mind that specifying a child collection in the base class means that you would have to cast the type of the child each time you want to use it.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
