The role of that interface is essentially to define advanced searching and sorting. <br><br>I see in the latest version of Csla 2.0 you implemented a searching and sorting class however you did not implement IDatabindingView. Considering IDatabindingView implements IDatabinding is there a reason why you choose not to implement this interface?<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Rob FireGarden</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, July 16, 2007</h2><P>I think Rocky implemented a useful object but it does have limitations. The biggest one is multi-property sorting.</P>
<P>I just looked at the code for the ObjectListView (in CSLA Contrib) and it does implement the interface you mentioned.</P>
<P>I use it exclusively for filtering and sorting as it can handle multi-property sorting.</P>
