<P>We have a lot of very duplicate seeming methods.&nbsp; For instance getReps.&nbsp; You can get reps by brand, by region, by supplier, all reps and then for each one of them you can do it with user authentication or with a devloper key.&nbsp; So that is 8 different methods basically doing the same thing just with different parameters.</P>
<P>Normally i would just create a getReps method and create an overload method for each one.&nbsp; However, in web services I couldn't do this.&nbsp; I had to create a unique MessageName property for each, which is fine.&nbsp; But then I have to add a line of code saying that my method does NOT conform to any WSI profile for it to work right.</P>
<P>This gives me some pause.&nbsp; Does it not conform to the standard because there is a good reason why I SHOULDN'T be overloading web methods?&nbsp; I'm not sure why it would be a bad idea?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
