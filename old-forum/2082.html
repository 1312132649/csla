Most likely that is your SqlException, which would contain everything there is to know about that exception.</P>
<P>If the error number you are looking for isn't directly in the SqlException object then you might need to catch the exception in your DataPortal_XYZ method and wrap it in a custom exception of your own creation that <EM>does</EM> contain all the information you need. Then throw your custom exception, which would then be available on the client through DataPortalException.BusinessException.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
