<div>Hey
guys i&#39;m facing a problem on my published and uploaded application to
the server. when i try to insert and update it populates the following
error message.
&quot;Object is not valid and can not be saved&quot;
any one can help me?

<p>Csla will throw this exception if you try to call Save on an object that is invalid. </p>
<p>So check the broken rules collection and your rules for possible problems.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

I changed one of the column length of my table from 50 to 100. and updated all my insert and update procedures accordingly. Do u thing i have to change anything from my classes side?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Daniel</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DanielK replied on Sunday, February 13, 2011</h2><p>oh, thanks for the idea i got it. it was in validation section. I will never forget the BrokenRulesCollection any more...loool</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p>

Does your save button have any logic to prevent saving if the object isn&#39;t valid?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
