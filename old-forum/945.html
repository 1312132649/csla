<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>To me these seem like natural candidates to be stored as structures – they’re small, they usually need to be passed together, they aren’t meaningful on their own.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But, if I declare a property on my business object to be a structure, it screws up the way binding works – a grid row only adds one column for the property, and when I drag-and-drop from the Data Sources window to a user control (like we learned in the book :)<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>) it won’t let me drag the structure properties.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>If I try to change the binding on an existing control, it lets me pick the property, but there’s no where to manually add the syntax to specify which structure element I want.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal>Has anyone else run into this type of problem?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>What are people’s thoughts about the trade-offs between designing a business object that binds easily vs. one that’s coherent and easy-to-understand for human consumers?</P>
