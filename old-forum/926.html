<P>I am using it to develop a small app and want to give credit for the framework in an about dialog or on a startup screen.</P>
<P>wondering if Rocky has any graphic he would like to have used for that?</P>
<P>for example my UI is using a library called "Krypton toolkit" and "Krypton Navigator"</P>
<P><A href="http://www.componentfactory.com/">http://www.componentfactory.com/</A></P>
<P>and they have a small graphic I will use to help identify that part.</P>
<P>I'd kinda like to do the same with csla.</P>
<P>any ideas ?</P>
<P>is there a good logo image I can use ?</P>

<P>Hey as a fellow coder, a long time DotNetRocks listener and all I know what kind of work goes into this stuff...</P>
<P>I now have a project in the works where I (if all goes well) will combine CSLA with some UI bits from </P>
<P><A href="http://www.componentfactory.com">www.componentfactory.com</A> to build a custom app for a client.</P>
<P>I am also looking at CodeSmith as a tool in this process....</P>
<P>funny Rocky; I have been going thru your book and it's like DejaVu or somthin'</P>
<P>I started way back with things like dBase III and Clipper and over time I have seen software for business keep playing on the same set of things.... I think we are getting close to a place where a good deal of the "Grunt Work" can be generated for us... which I hope is a good thing.</P>
<P>many times I have had to work to make the things that should be simple work.... and not had time to make the neat stuff work that really makes the app shine!</P>
<P>so yep, I like to "Give Credit Where Credit is Due"&nbsp; :-)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
