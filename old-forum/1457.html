<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I would agree with the arg option and considered it 
for simplicity. My problem with the regex as it currently sits is that it 
appears to be doing two things (breaking pure oop): checking for required and 
checking for syntax. That's why I recommended isolating the regex check for this 
rule and using the required rule separately as necessary. Also, it was just 
easier to do this rather than implementing the a custom RuleArgs class. I'm open 
to either option.</FONT></DIV>
