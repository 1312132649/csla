<p>Is there any reason to consider exluding the OrderLineItemList from the Order object, and instead use a &quot;getter&quot; or UnitOfWork object to retrieve both of them together?&nbsp; I ask because folks in my group are having that discussion.</p>
<p>As best I can tell, if an Order object is always going to consume line items, then a property of type OrderLineItemList should be included in the Order&nbsp;object.&nbsp; I don&#39;t see a reason to create a wrapper (&quot;getter&quot;) object that pulls both when the Order object could have referenced the OrderLineItemList in the first place.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, April 04, 2012</h2><p>My vote is for having orderlineitems as a property of the order object.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way the order object can for calculations like OrderTotal, Discount and also know if any childh as broken rules.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Wednesday, April 04, 2012</h2><p>Good point about the calculations.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t mention that as I was discussing with my team.&nbsp; I don&#39;t see what is gained by separatin them out, but having not used CSLA too&nbsp;long I don&#39;t want to assume that I know 100% the right way to go about it.&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
