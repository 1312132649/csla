Otherwise, if the new CSLA REQUIRES .Net 3.0, call it CSLA 3.0. If the WCF functionality is totally plugable, 2.2 sounds fine (don't give a 2.2 and 3.0 release).</P>

<P>If Microsoft decides in December that .Net 3.0 is not the right fit for their marketing strategy and changes the name again to .Net Framework 2007, then what?</P>
<P>I guess you could also follow the actual version number and start with it; then you would end up with CSLA.NET 2.0.50727.2.1 at this point.&nbsp; Then everyone would know without a doubt that a particular version of CSLA would work with a certain version of the .Net Framework.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Monday, October 16, 2006</h2><P>IMO, it all depends on whether or not the new version of CSLA <STRONG>requires </STRONG>.NET 3.0.&nbsp; If it does, then regardless of how ridiculous it was for Microsoft to mislead us with their naming choice, it would be wise to increment CSLA's major version number as its dependancies have changed.&nbsp; If this is strictly a set of code changes that won't break existing apps, then go for the minor version increment.&nbsp; I think this is consistent with traditional versioning standards.</P>
<P>The fact that CSLA's version and .NET's version coincide should be left as a coincidence.&nbsp; The decision should be based on the impact of the changes, specifically whether it will break existing users' code and whether it will require a different configuration (.NET 3.0) on developer's systems.</P>
<P>Just my 2 cents...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Tuesday, October 17, 2006</h2><P>FWIW, I've just voted for CSLA.NET 3.0.&nbsp; The "intent" being&nbsp;to keep the major version number in sync with the .NET framework major version number.</P>
<P>I think this will probably cause least confusion to new members joining the development community and least confusion for IT infrastructure staff that have to install and support the apps.</P>
<P>It should make it easy to answer the question:&nbsp; "I'm running .NET framework version (1.xx, 2.xx, 3.xx), so which version of the CSLA.NET framework do I need?".</P>
<P>The answer will then (more naturely) be "CSLA.NET 1.xx, CSLA.NET 2.xx or CSLA.NET 3.xx".</P>
