I see the option when I right-click on the "Modules" folder. So I can add a module but not a view. Which are the rules that the Guidance Package verifies for the option to be visible in the contextual menu of the Views folder? I have another CAB project where I cand add views (the option is available) and I don't see the diff√©rence between the 2 projects.</P>
<P>Thank you!</P>
