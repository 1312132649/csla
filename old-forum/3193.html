Rocky, whilst you are there, how about including ObjectAdaptor nullable
property issues which now seems to no longer&nbsp; rate a mention in
the wish list priority.<br>

<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, July 28, 2007</h2><P>ObjectAdapter's nullable issue is #13 on the <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/wishlist.aspx">wish list</A>.</P>
<P>It is important to realize that the order of the items in the list doesn't matter. I do the ones I have time/resources/interest in doing.</P>
<P>In the case of ObjectAdapter, it is one of the oldest pieces of code in the framework, and it is outdated. Some of the techniques I used to build it were ok, but I now know much better techniques (and even use some of them elsewhere in the framework). So OA really needs to be rebuilt, nearly from scratch - which is a fair amount of work obviously, and has slipped lower on the priority list as more technology data bind against objects, thus reducing the need to support DataSet concepts at all.</P>
<P>Honestly, LINQ may well entirely eliminate the need for the DataSet, and thus the OA. Toward that end, in 3.5 I might move OA from CSLA itself into CSLAcontrib, allowing anyone who wants to use it to maintain it.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, July 28, 2007</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>Jimbo:</strong></div><div>I am pleased to read that this issue has been identified as important and is now high on the todo list for csla 3.<BR></div></BLOCKQUOTE></P>
<P>Actually, CSLA3 is out, so the issue should (I think) be resolved. Are you having the issue in CSLA3?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jimbo replied on Monday, July 30, 2007</h2>Rocky,&nbsp; <br>I should have said I was referring to version 2.1.1&nbsp; ( bad omission) .<br>Looking forward to testing with version 3. <br>&nbsp;I notice that the project structure in the download does not use folder names like csla30vb etc.&nbsp; as in the version 2 downloads. Is there a reason for the change ?<br><br>jimbo<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
