<P>The diagrams for project tracker in C# Business Objects 2005 (page 338 for example) show these relationships - does anyone know how these were done??&nbsp; Our best idea at present is to cut and paste the clasimages into Visio and join together there, but this obviously loses the link with our code if we then change the classes.</P>
<P>cheers,<BR>Roger.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, January 27, 2009</h2>That diagram was created by using SnagIt to grab the class bubbles from Visual Studio. These were pasted into PowerPoint, and I drew lines between the classes.<br><br>Either that or I used Visio.<br><br>But either way, I drew the lines by hand. Totally not useful for real work, but very workable for creating a diagram in a book...<br><br>I wish I had a good answer for you, because I want to use it too!!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
