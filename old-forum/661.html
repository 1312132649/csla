<P>thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Tuesday, July 18, 2006</h2><P>Web or Windows?</P>
<P>What are you doing differently from the sample project, ProjectTracker?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>yh_ink replied on Tuesday, July 18, 2006</h2><P>i am not doing anything different.But what i am trying to do is call my class parent class in my webform and&nbsp; through it&nbsp; trying to update the child.</P>
<P>let me explain in detail.</P>
<P>first my webforn calls the parent get method.I have set a property of child in the parent object.Both parent and child here work on two different thing.entirely different.</P>
<P>Assume _parent(parent)&amp;_child (child)</P>
<P>this is the wave i call from the form</P>
<P>//call get&nbsp;&nbsp; _parent.get();</P>
<P>if(_parent._child.login != null)&nbsp; //here it checks for login in the child if exists</P>
<P>_parent._child.login= _parent.login;//gets parent login and sets to child</P>
<P>_parent._child.password = _parent.password //sets password</P>
<P>_Parent.save();//call parent.save </P>
<P>things are set in the parent object as they have to be set</P>
<P>problem here is when i call save it dosent go to the parent class</P>
<P>there r several ways of working with it instead of working with save method...but i got to use it that way</P>
<P>this is not the code but thats flow of it.i am new to it.</P>
<P>thanks</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I am not knowing what to be done exactly how i should call i guess...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 18, 2006</h2><P>Are you using CSLA .NET 1.53 or 2.0.3?</P>
<P>If you are using 2.0, I'd suggest that you use the CslaDataSource control and use data binding rather than manually updating all the controls.</P>
<P>If you are using 1.0, then you kind of do need to update the controls manually.</P>
<P>From your example I assume you are creating some sort of system to record usernames and passwords? Or are you trying to create a custom principal object - which is a whole other thing, and then you are totally on the wrong track with you code.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
