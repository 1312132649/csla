<P><FONT face=Arial>Since Csla 2.0 we were presented to a lot of new members of the Csla Stereotypes family.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>First came DynamicRoot and DynamicRootList (aka ERLB). They arrived on a boat named Csla 2.1</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The next boat - Csla 3.0 - didn't bring in any new members.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Then a big ship arrived - Csla 3.5 and we saw two departures, four arrivals and two renamings.</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Arial>Young DynamicRoot and DynamicRootList were baptized and became Dynamic<STRONG>Editable</STRONG>Root and Dynamic<STRONG>Editable</STRONG>RootList. </FONT>
<LI><FONT face=Arial>Senior citizens ReadOnly and ReadOnlyList crossed the sword bridge. </FONT>
<LI><FONT face=Arial>On the other hand, new born ReadOnlyRoot, ReadOnlyChild, ReadOnlyRootList and ReadOnlyChildList joined us.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Back to the topic, I read a lot of times that a ReadOnlyList (root or child) can contain EditableChild objects.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In August 2007 on <STRONG><FONT color=#000080>I Am Working On My Using CSLA NET 30 Ebook And Wrote Some Content That I Don't Think I'm Going To Use In The Book</FONT></STRONG> </FONT><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/IAmWorkingOnMyUsingCSLANET30EbookAndWroteSomeContentThatIDontThinkImGoingToUseInTheBook.aspx"><FONT face=Arial>http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/IAmWorkingOnMyUsingCSLANET30EbookAndWroteSomeContentThatIDontThinkImGoingToUseInTheBook.aspx</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial>&nbsp;is a very useful example of changing a ReadOnly object by setting <FONT face="Courier New">IsReadOnly</FONT> to false, changing whatever was needed and reseting <FONT face="Courier New">IsReadOnly</FONT> to true.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The point is:<BR>If&nbsp;my ReadOnlyList (root or child) contains an&nbsp;EditableChild, is there a way to save the EditableChild?</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, September 14, 2009</h2><P>There is no way to save a read-only object - that makes no sense as it is read-only.</P>
<P>The example of altering a read-only object or list was to illustrate that it is possible to update cached "read-only" data without reloading the object(s) from the database. </P>
<P>But that's really a narrow scenario where you have cached read-only data that you know is stale, and which you can (at least partially) update for known changes made by an editable object.</P>
<P>Even this is not necessarily all that useful, at least not in a multi-user environment, since the underlying data could have been edited by other users too, and the cache becomes rapidly invalid. But in a single-user environment where the cached list is relatively large, it can be worth the effort of updating the cache without reloading from the database.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Tuesday, September 15, 2009</h2><P><FONT face=Arial><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>There is no way to save a read-only object - that makes no sense as it is read-only.</div></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>I couldn't agree more. I'm rewriting some codegen templates and I think the templates should check that the stereotypes used in a parent/child relationship make sense.</FONT></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
