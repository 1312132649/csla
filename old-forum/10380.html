<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;m using CSLA 4.1.x and can&#39;t seem to find any good sample projects with implementation of all the class stereotypes discussed.&nbsp; No disrespect, but Project Tracker is incomplete, bloated and not an easily identifiable &quot;Real World&quot; example.&nbsp; Any other sample projects out there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 17, 2011</h2><p>No disrespect taken :)&nbsp; I&#39;ve posted numerous times on the forum that ProjectTracker is tied to book projects, not to CSLA release schedules. As such, it is being updated as we speak, and the updates will be in some future CSLA release.</p>
<p>The fastest/best way to get the stereotypes right now is to buy the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;ProductID=22">Using CSLA 4 ebook series</a>, because the code samples for the ebooks include current sample code.</p>
<p>You can also look at the current (work-in-progress) ProjectTracker code in the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Repository.aspx">CSLA .NET svn repository</a>&nbsp;(in Samples\Net\cs\ProjectTracker). The business library is pretty stable at this point, and demonstrates the stereotypes described in the <em>Using CSLA 4: Creating Business Objects</em> ebook (book 2 in the series), as well as one of the data access techniques discussed in the&nbsp;<em>Using CSLA 4: Data Access</em> ebook (book 3 in the series).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hramos360 replied on Tuesday, May 17, 2011</h2><p>Rocky, thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I did purchase the ebook series a few weeks ago.&nbsp; To be clear, are you referring to the written samples in the ebook or actual sample files?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I will get the latest form the svn repository as suggested.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 17, 2011</h2><p>The <em>Creating Business Objects</em> ebook has written samples in the book.</p>
<p>The <em>Data Access</em> ebook has sample files - I think every stereotype is covered in the various data access sample solutions.</p>
<p>I chose to do all the sample work for the <em>Data Access</em> book instead of book 2, because without <em>some</em> data access you can&#39;t really run the code. I think it would have been unsatisfying to have non-working examples for book 2...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
