I have then created a seperate vb.net assembly with a com class in it that I&#39;m using to join my business objects to vb6. So in my old vb6 program I late bind to the com class and I call the methods on that, without direct referencing the proper business objects (none of the com class functions return any custom classes)</p>
<p>Doing this I can successfully get data out of my business objects, but when I try and save them I get a run time error &quot;Unable to find assembly&quot; that looks like it is trying to get my business object component. However the vb6 component does reference the com class that does reference the business object component so I can&#39;t see what is going wrong.</p>
<p>Can anyone shed some light onto why this error occurs? I&#39;m thinking that I don&#39;t know enough about how things work when they get referenced, as I&#39;ve been confused by weird referencing behaviour before (probably only weird due to my lack of knowledge) .</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>dan_morey replied on Wednesday, November 23, 2011</h2><p>I found that if I signed my assemblies and added them to the GAC then this error can be avoided.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the only solution, but it suits me for now.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
