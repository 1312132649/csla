<P>Is there any documentation on using this anywhere?&nbsp; I created a project to build the ObjectListView and added a form to the project.&nbsp; When I try to add the ObjectListView to the form I get the following error:</P>
<P>Failed to create component 'ObjectListView'.&nbsp; </P>
<P>'System.MissingMethodException:&nbsp; Constructor on type 'Csla.ObjectListView' not found.</P>
<P>Any ideas on what I am doing wrong?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Friday, September 22, 2006</h2>It looks like this is my next bug fix.&nbsp; The ObjectListView does not have a default constructor and does not allow you to change the list after it has been created.&nbsp; It looks like I will need to change this.&nbsp; For the time being you will have to just create it in code.&nbsp; I will work on this over the weekend.<br><br>As for documentation, you should be able to use this just like a DataView (or as close as possible) except that this works with IList objects instead of DataTables.&nbsp; So the DataView would be the place to get documentation.&nbsp; If it does not behave similarly to the DataView, I have probably done something wrong.<br><br>The major difference is that the ObjectListView can have a default item.&nbsp; This item is always visible and never sorted (it is always at index 0).&nbsp; You can use it in a manner similar to the following:<br><br>ObjectListView view = new ObjectListView(someIList);<br>view.IncludeDefault = true;<br>view[0]["SomeProperty"] = 10;<br>view[0]["AnotherProperty"] = "A description";<br><br>If you have any other questions, feel free to post them.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mr_lasseter replied on Friday, September 22, 2006</h2><P>I guess I misunderstood what this was.&nbsp; I thought it was a listview control that supported databinding.&nbsp; The name threw me off. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Friday, September 22, 2006</h2>No, it is a view onto a list of objects.&nbsp; I have done a data-bindable ListView in the past, built off of one of Rocky's examples, but unless you need grouping, I would suggest using the new DataGridView control.&nbsp; You can modify its appearance so that it looks and acts almost exactly like a ListView.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
