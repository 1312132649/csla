If you look at chapters 8, 9 or 10 you'll notice that in all cases the application does a logout before anything else happens - effectively making sure that the current principal on the client is an instance of your custom principal object.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>atlanta replied on Monday, February 12, 2007</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Rocky,<br>that worked....I could give anything on both sides as long as it is the same.<br><br>I scanned through my ebook, I don't think this is mentioned. <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Monday, February 12, 2007</h2>Wether or not you want to use security, you need to create a principal (at least a dummy one) and call LogOut() in "Application_AcquireRequestState". Check in the Global.asax file inside the project tracker for an example...<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>atlanta replied on Monday, February 12, 2007</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, will do.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
