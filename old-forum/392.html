You could expose that from your bo if you need to. Again, it's not the same, but it'll get you closer to what you want.<br>It'd be nice if the EditLevel where exposed through the interface.<br><br>It would also be very nice if we had an application level parameter to disable n-level undo or at least a class level attribute to permanently disable undo for a given type.<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 16, 2006</h2>EditLevel is now protected in both BusinessBase and BusinessListBase, so you have access in both cases. If you want to expose it as a public member, or through an interface, you can create your own base class for this purpose, but I think having it as protected is sufficient for the general case.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
