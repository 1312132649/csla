<P>I'm interested what you think about this design. I find it very usefull, but few people argued about it, but I think it is becouse of the problem ORMs have with it and a lack of foreign keys in DB. But using manual SQL in DP_xyz, implementation is very easy. It's about reusable contacts BO, collections and even UI. </P>
<P>I have IContactOwner that has 0..n IContact contacts. Navigation is only from owner to contacts. Then Address, Telephone, ... implement IContact. In any other module, I can implement IContactOwner, for example for Person, Building and so on ... So you can make Contact management control that is fully reusable.</P>
<P>I'm very interested in your oppinions&nbsp;if this reusability is worth of turning off ORM in this situation? Does it break any OOD or OO principle?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
