<p>One of the great things about CSLA, in my opinion, is the ability to write multiple clients across different platforms.</p>
<p>Does anyone have practical experience they could share when making a breaking change in the business assembly while supporting multiple legacy clients (Web, WinForms, WPF and &nbsp;Android to be specific)?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>If you can write a new class and deprecate the old one but leave it intact, that would allow you to update over time.&nbsp; if you cant do that you may have to update all the clients at once.</p>
<p>What is the nature of the change?&nbsp; if you give more specifics on what you&#39;re doing there might be other options too.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
