<P>That is to say, your current code, with minimal changes, should continue to work in 3.6.</P>
<P>Most of the changes in 3.5 were around code reduction and productivity increases for business developers. That's where a lot of the new syntax and data portal features (all of which are optional) come from.</P>
<P>Most of the changes in 3.6 were around adding async behaviors to maintain parity with CSLA .NET for Silverlight. These are optional features.</P>
<P>The thing to keep in mind, is that all the great productivity and code reduction features in 3.5 and higher do require using the new property syntax. You don't have to go there, but most of the value of upgrading comes from going there :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>boo replied on Thursday, June 11, 2009</h2>Thanks Rocky!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>matt tag replied on Thursday, June 11, 2009</h2><font size="1" face="Verdana">what is the best documentation for a CSLA veteran to learn about the new 3.5 property syntax (not just the "how", but the "why").<br><br>I opened ProjectTrackervb this morning and could barely understand the code!<br><br>I'm getting old.&nbsp; Now get off my lawn!<br></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, June 11, 2009</h2>Matt,<br />Try reading this thread:<br />http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/33806.aspx<br /><br />Joe<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>boo replied on Thursday, June 11, 2009</h2>Is there an example of what 'FriendlyName' is used for in the PropertyInfo when using RegisterProperty.<br><br>I thought maybe this is what would show up on a broken rule, but it's apparently not for that.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 11, 2009</h2>

is the best documentation for a CSLA veteran to learn about the new 3.5

I opened ProjectTrackervb this morning and could barely understand the code!<br>
