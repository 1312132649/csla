I want to start using this Framework but I have very little expreience in coding with CSLA. I want to buy a book, but application that I am developing is just 2 page application. So in that case I would not be able to buy that book. If anyone can lead me to sample application/reference materials where I can learn about basics features available in CSLA framework and&nbsp;&nbsp; so that I cam implement my application with n-tired approach.<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br><br>Ocean<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Fabio replied on Wednesday, October 11, 2006</h2>If you had download the FW you have ProjectTracker.<br>ProjectTracker is the example you are looking for...<br>Any way is better that you buy the book not only to understand all concepts... (CSLA need our monetary support too).<br>Bye.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jkellywilkerson replied on Thursday, October 12, 2006</h2><P>I have to agree with Fabio here.&nbsp; If you have the CSLA framework, it comes with the example application that is designed and developed in the book.&nbsp; You should have everything that you need to get started.&nbsp; However, the book is highly recommended.&nbsp; It will teach you the in's and out's of the framework and the example app; it is WELL WORTH the investment.</P>
