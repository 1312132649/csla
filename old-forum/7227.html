<p class=MsoNormal><span>Have you looked at the clientconfig file that&#8217;s in the
CSLA project? I suspect Microsoft changed some WCF config options, and that may
mean you need to update your clientconfig as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am having exactly the same issue.&nbsp; I also have built
CSLA for Silverlight 3&nbsp;using both 3.6.3 and 3.7.0.&nbsp; I was successful
in the 3.6.3 implementation (albeit with an unresolved async issue that I will
post about separately).&nbsp; 3.7.0, however, threw the above mentioned error.&nbsp;
I am using the same ServiceReferences.ClientConfig that worked successfully in
the 3.6.3 implementation.<br>

Removing the "Csla." prefix in my ServiceReferences.ClientConfig endpoint contract on the Silverlight app solved the problem.<br /><br />Strange.<br /><br />Roy</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
