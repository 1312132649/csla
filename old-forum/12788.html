<p>RemotingProxy was removed in 2012 for CSLA 4.5.x release.</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslabugs/edit_bug.aspx?id=1071">http://www.lhotka.net/cslabugs/edit_bug.aspx?id=1071</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>You could probably create a private build/nuget packages of the latest CSLA with the missing RemotingProxy or move onto WCF or the Http proxy.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, October 29, 2014</h2><p>Thanks Johnny for confirming that.&nbsp; I think we just might get the latest code before it was removed and drop it into our assembly.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
