And I could do so but changes to the IsAuthenticated property are not changing the enabled status of the button.<br><br>So I thought it's because Identity inherits from readonlybase and there is no propertychanged event being fired. So I changed Identity to inherit from businessbase instead of readonlybase. Then in b<br>usinessprincipa in login/logout I have it raise the new identities PropertyChanged event. But this doesn't do it either. <br><br>I have tried both update modes for the bindings and bindingsource.resetbindings. No luck. If I rebind the button that does change the value but of course pretty much defeats the purpose behind databinding.<br><br>Anyone have any thoughts?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Dean<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dean replied on Saturday, August 26, 2006</h2>Ok - figured out one way to do this.<br><br>I think the problem with binding directly to the identity is that it is replaced during the login/logout procedures. So the binding is no longer valid.<br><br>Rather than change the businessIdentity to a businessbase obj I have a login class that is business base. This has an IsAuthenticated property so I bind to it. All my login/logout calls go to this class so I can raise a propertyHasChanged("IsAuthenticated") when the principal changes and this object is not replaced during the login/logout operation. This seems to work.<br><br>I have some button panels that give access to my program. This way I can disable/enable them depending on whether a user is logged in or not.<br><br>Dean<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
