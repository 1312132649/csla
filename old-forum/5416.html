For some reason when I bind this to my form, having the child bound to a grid, and when I change a property in the parent it causes the GetIDValue of the child collection info objects to fire. Wouldnt be such a big deal but it puts the grid to the bottom of the list of children. </P>
<P>If I comment out the PropertyHasChanged statement of the parent property this behavior does not occur, but of course this method needs to be fired for BO reasons. Also if I remove the Datasource of the BindingSource of the child bindingsource&nbsp;the GetIDValue methods do not fire. </P>
<P>Could someone please shed some light on what I might be doing here. </P>
<P>Thank You,</P>

<P>This is an area that is <EM>very</EM> tricky, and there've been continual bug fixes around data binding. If you are using a current version there could still be issues (though I hope not), but if you are using anything older then the first thing to do is get current.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
