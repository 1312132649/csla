IE:&nbsp; It is not honored for projects that are part of the solution. <br><br>But - with these limitations - applying EditorBrowsable to Is.. properties in Csla will hide Is... flags from the designers like DataSource Explorer but still allow databinding to be manually configured in Windows Forms.&nbsp; <br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, December 30, 2009</h2><P>I am not sure I like that though either Jonny. The reason being that this would make the properties invisible to a lot of people's intellisense. I can just imagine all the confusion as some people see the properties and other people don't (depending on their VS settings).</P>
<P>This is already an issue with things like the EditLevel property, which is set to either Never or Advanced. That is the correct setting for EditLevel, because it shouldn't normally be used (it is there for diagnostic purposes), but people get confused when they can't see it in intellisense and they assume it isn't actually there at all...</P>
<P>I can live with that for EditLevel, but not for something that should be commonly used like IsDirty.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
