However, some of these properties are used in Use Case 1 and some in Use Case 2. </P>
<P>As I understand from responsibility driven design, I should create two class here, Project1 dealing with Use Case 1 and Project2 dealing with Use Case 2. Use Case 1 is 'Adding a Project' however adding a project does not mean filling all the fields in database. Project1 deals with Use Case 1 so I am thinking that the validations of only those properties that Project1 (Use Case1) use, should go in Project1 and validations of properties that Project2 (Use Case2) use, should go in Project2.</P>
<P>Is that the correct way?</P>

This means that you cannot use the rules that come with CSLA and have to write your <br>own set, even for the simple ones like 'StringRequired' ...depends on how many that will be in your case.<br><br>Another hint:<br><br>If you follow the 'separate objects for separate use cases' route and you need a concurrency mechanism <br>for each use case ('Adding a Project' does not!), then the solution with one timestamp column will not <br>work any more. Maybe inserting a new timestamp column for each use case can be a solution. <br>Again, it depends on how many there will be.<br><br>Stefan<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
