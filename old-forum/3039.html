Type of move I am suggesting is naturally to another company that sees value in .Net<br /> <br />;)<br /> <br />Nermin Dibek<br />Magenic Technologies<br /> <br />Nobody's more serious about Microsoft.<br /><br />________________________________<br /><br />From: omrivm [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net]<br />Sent: Thu 6/14/2007 7:47 AM<br />To: Nermin Dibek<br />Subject: [CSLA .NET] CSLA and Java<br /><br /><br />Hi,<br />I'm using csla.net in my company as our main infrastructure.
