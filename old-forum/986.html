I tired to build a class diagram inside visual studio 2005.&nbsp; (just as the case in page 342 of the book" Expert VB 2005 Business object").&nbsp; in the book, the solid-line represent collaboration between objects and dashed lines seems to represents possible to navigate.&nbsp; However, in VS2005, it represents different things ie. inheritance and association.&nbsp; So, any advice on this issue?<br>2. I don't truely understand the best practice to handle attachments in our cases.&nbsp; Should we stored in DB and act as a property in the business object (the whole attachment)?&nbsp; or should it just a pointer to a file system?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, August 23, 2006</h2>I used the class diagram tool to create the basic class diagrams, which are in the code download and available from <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx</a>.<br><br>However, in the book I merely used a similar notation.

<P>My understanding of the rationale has to do with performance scanning and retrieving records.&nbsp; Like you inferred, the larger the attachment, the larger the record.&nbsp; Obviously this plays a role in the performance you see in your DB when trying to retrieve records.</P>
<P>Also consider that in most cases, especially with web apps, all you need is the reference to the file at first glance anyway.&nbsp; Attachments are typically shown as a link so you don't need the binary&nbsp;column with the rest of the data anyway.</P>
<P>And, in all of our applications (preference), our attachments are defined in a separate table that references the parent (document) because they are optional have a many-to-one relationship with the parent doc.&nbsp; While this does reduce the impact on the parent table, you still have to perform a join to the attachments table to retrieve the list.</P>
<P>Ultimately, much like almost everything else we do, it is up to you.</P>
<P>Hope that helps.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, August 24, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/basicblue/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>SonOfPirate:</strong></div><div>And, in all of our applications (preference), our attachments are

<P>From a development standpoint it also makes life easier to deal with a file system, obviously, because your not contending with streaming content and can allow the OS to handle retrieving the file.&nbsp; Changes to the file system are easily handled by using a config setting to indicate the physical path and only storing relative paths in the database.&nbsp; But you are right about data integrity as someone can obviously remove the file with a reference remaining in the db (my biggest argument with the DBA's!)</P>
<P>Oh, another issue presented by the DBA's was the size and time required to backup the database when 2/3 of its size are blobs that could be stored externally.&nbsp; The contents of the file will most likely change much less frequently than the database contents, so separating them would separate the backup requirements as well.</P>
<P>I know there was more and am sure there are a ton of articles online listing the pro's and con's.&nbsp; Not saying I agree 100%; as I said, I've made arguments for doing so as well.&nbsp; It's just the rule of thumb I've been told.&nbsp; I think the application dictates more than the DBA (at least for me) if we're going to follow the rule of thumb or not.&nbsp; I typically look at the size and quantity of the files and use that as a guideline.&nbsp; If you are dealing with a LOT of files and/or files that have substantial size, then why bog your database down with the task of streaming the file when you can leave it to do its job (managing data) and let the file system manage the files?</P>
<P>Everything in programming is subjective, eh?</P>

You could easily create an mdf for the purpose of holding large blobs of binary data and that way you wouldn't suffer fragmentation or bottlenecks when working with regular data.<br>Of course, DBAs don't want to have to maintain this structure, so the will want you to put the binary information directly into disk. <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /><br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>yipchunyu replied on Monday, August 28, 2006</h2>thx all for your advice.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Monday, August 28, 2006</h2><P>I agree with the general spirit of this thread in that a DB is design to store data and a file system is design to store files.&nbsp; With that said I would definitly store the attachements on the file system.&nbsp; In fact I had that very similar use case a few months ago.&nbsp; I had attachements stored into the database and that did put a pay load on performance and had to revert back to storing the attachements on the file system instead of the DB.&nbsp; Take it from me, store the attachements on the file system.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>yipchunyu replied on Tuesday, August 29, 2006</h2>a related question. <br>In the above case, the attachment(s) is one of the property of the object 'document' (in my design).&nbsp; Must I seperate it as a new classes or use some other way to handle this?
