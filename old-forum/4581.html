truly appreciate your help and feedback. I will give you below a
background about our situation, the results of the research I made, and
then I will mention my requirements.</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">I actually was refered to CSLA.NET from www.asp.net forums, and I need to know if CSLA.NET will be of value to us, with reagards to our requirements.<br></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><font size="2"><u><b>Background:</b></u><br></font></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><font size="2">1.
I work in a company in IT Dept., and we are a team of 3-4 developers,
with different levels of skills in
ASP.NET, and with excellent development skills each in his area of
specialty (Lotus Notes, Java ...etc). We have highly skilled
developers in ASP.NET.
We are using VS2005/SQL Server for the Web Application Development, and
VSS for Source Control, in addition to other tools/platforms.<br><br>2.
The objective of our team is to develop Applications
for the End Users to increase their productivity (Using Web Based
Applications).&nbsp; The back-end systems are in UNIX/Adabas. We are using
CONNX SQL Gateway for Data Access from the Web Apps to Adabas. SAP
Portals will be deployed in a couple of months, and we are
migrating from UNIX/Adabas to SAP in a couple of years.
<br><br>3. The applications we are developing may be targeted for ALL
Staff, or for
certain department/section in the company The total number of the Staff
is 1000 (aprox) and the avareage number of staff in each dept is 30.
<br><br>4. Our 
<span>biggest problem
</span> in developing Good Looking Professional Applications, and we
have not yet upgraded to VS2008, so I guess AJAX for .NET 3.x,
Silverlight and Expression are not an option for the near futures, but
surely, we will have to
upgrade sooner or later, which will take some time because we have to
arrange for training, licensing, budget ...etc.
<br><br>5. The time frame to build the required applications is
usually tight (and always the users want the application to finish
yesterday). The average period to launch an application after
completing a development cycle is 2-3 months. The application goes
under continuous improvements over 6-10 months, and in some cases, it
will span over a couple of years.
<br><br><u>Below is some info I found based on my research, on how to build good looking web applications:</u>
<br><br>1. Using CMS Tools like DotNetNuke from: </font></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/" title="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dotnetnuke.com/</a></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><font size="2">. and.or Umbraco from: 
    
<a href="http://www.umbraco.org/" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://www.umbraco.org/
</a> , </font></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">where such tools are very good in building attractive UI, </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><font size="2">but usually, as per my personal opinion, I do not recommend using such tools for cases like ours, because of the following:</font></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><font size="2">&nbsp; 1.1. They do a lot of things for you that you don't need, which causes BLOATED Output and possible performance issues.
<br>&nbsp; 1,2,&nbsp; They may impose some annoying limitations,&nbsp; which may force
you to perform some unusual tricks to make them happen, if that is
possible in the first place. So the time you saved to build the UI, has
been wasted in finding solutions for tricks.
<br>&nbsp; 1.3. They may require certain configuration which is not available, or will cause unwanted results.
<br>&nbsp; 1.4. They require a special learning curve. Each tool has its own
technique. I prefer to spend my time learning the original APS.NET
infrastructure instead.<br>&nbsp; 1.5. </font>They duplicate the functionality
provided by SAP Portal, and the effort needed to implement and learn how
to use this tool will be wasted.<br>&nbsp; 1.6. </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">For DNN, it generates a Huge number of objects
for SQL Server Database and Web Parts/Files/Folders under IIS, ie, it is
a Bloated Engine: Each time you create a web site for an application, it
will create a large number of objects which you have no control over, and
if you mix different web application in the same web site, it will confusing.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><br><br>---&gt; <b>I am interested in your feedback </b>about such CMS tools please, and how it compares to CSLA.NET ?<br><br>2. There is
also many other ASP.NET Starter Kits. or CSK and and the like, some of which
seems less complex than DNN and umbraco. I need your input on such
tools and how they are different from CSLA.NET.

It is really very useful.<br><br>Following is my initial feedback in general:<br><br>1. I took a closer look at CSLA, and I am really impresed with it. I think it will be very useful. But I need to complement it with a nice GUI Tool or something like that. I do not necessary have to get a complex engine to do the GUI for us (like DNN). For example, if there is a simple template that I can copy and paste or re-use, it will be OK. I want to avoid editing the commands for CSS, Skins and Themes ... I need something ready and easy to apply different templates. Something like CSS Switcher ?<br><br>2. Any feedback on the problems of DNN I mentioned earlier in this thread, and if there is any other alternatives ?<br><br>3. Teleriks looks very cool ... but they are costly ... I am not sure if this idea will be attractive to the management !!!

<P>Great !</P>
<P>I hope that CSLA.NET and WCSF do not overlap, or of they do overlap, it will be minimal. I do not want to confuse the team members about which framework to use for what part ??!!</P>
<P>So, as per my understanding, we will use CSLA.NET for developing the Business Logic and WCSF for the Front End, UI ...etc.&nbsp; Is my understanding correct ?</P>
<P>Tarek.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RikGarner replied on Wednesday, April 02, 2008</h2><P>Yes, that is what I am suggesting. You should make it clear that CSLA should be the basis of your business logic layer and that WCSF should be the framework you use to build your user interface. In practice I think you will find that easier than you might imagine.</P>
<P>It will probably be a good idea to have your business logic (built upon CSLA) in a different project from your UI. This has a couple of advantages;&nbsp;if there was ever a need, you could reuse your business logic dll for a winforms app. Also, you may find some of your team members tend to prefer working on one side or the other or have an aptitude in one area over the other.</P>

<P>I am not sure if I made I was able to explain the problem I am facing corectly!</P>
<P>In the normal situation, the data is supposed to be stored in one Database say only from Adabas. So, the SQL String looks like the following:</P>
<P>"select StaffID, StaffName, StaffAge, Salary&nbsp;from AdabasTable;"<BR>(Note: This is a simplistic example, of course, the actual case is mor complicated).</P>
<P>But the above cannot be done becuase the "Salary" is stored in different Database, in SQL Server, which requires another connection string.</P>
<P>One way to solve this problem, is to define a Linked Server in SQL Server, use OpenQuery() function to open the&nbsp;Adabas Table&nbsp;in SQL Server,&nbsp;and use one SQL String to join the tables between Adabas and SQL Server. But this methods defeets the value of OOP, as you may have already built a class to retrieve the first part, and all what you need to do is to get second part of the data from the other Database. The ideal way is to define another class and re-use the functionality of the first class, but I cannot figure out how to do that exactly.</P>
<P>So, we can simply build a Staff Class as follows:</P>
<P>(Note: The syntax my not be 100% correct, this is just for clarification purposes)</P>
<P>public class clsStaff1<BR>private _StaffID as String<BR>private _StaffName as String<BR>private _StaffAge as Integer<BR>private Salary as double<BR>public propert ReadOnly&nbsp;StaffID() as String<BR>&nbsp; get <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return _StaffID<BR>&nbsp; end get<BR>end property<BR>...bla bla bla ...<BR>... bla bla...<BR>... same for StaffName, StaffAge, and Salaray ... read only is needed...<BR>public shared function getStaffList() as DataTable<BR>&nbsp; con = open connection to Adabas Table<BR>&nbsp; SQLStr = "select StaffID, StaffName, StaffAge from AdabasTable"<BR>&nbsp; Execute the SQL String and return the DataTable using Adaptor for example !<BR>end function<BR>end class</P>
<P>The question is: How to define another class "clsStaff2" the re-uses the first class (inherits) and just add the the "Salary" from SQL Server Table ?</P>
<P>I think one way to do that is to do the Join between the 2 DataTables in the VB Code, is this possible ?</P>
<P>Is this approach practical in the first place ?</P>
