The Map() method maps properties/fields from one object to another - without processing any child or other objects.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vbbeta replied on Tuesday, January 11, 2011</h2><p>Hi i just saw this thread i would like to check if the cska DataMapper is&nbsp; not recursive how is the way to get done the Parent/ Child collection VIA data mapper any help</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, January 11, 2011</h2><p>You just loop through each object in the graph and apply DataMapper to each object individually. Normally this is how you get the data from ASP.NET anyway, so it is a pretty natural process.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vbbeta replied on Wednesday, January 12, 2011</h2><p>Thanks rocky for the reply</p>

<p>i actually at the did that i wrote </p>
<p>For Each row As DataRow in Transaction Table </p>
<p>Dim ItemMapper as New Csla.Data.ObjectAdapter</p>
<p>ItemMapper.Fill(transaction.Item(row(&quot;Id&quot;)).Items</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>GridContro.DataSource= TransactionTable</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p><b>But discovered&nbsp; </b></p>
<p><b>That the GridView is giving me all the items from the derived class EG IsNew, IsFalse . and not just the BusinessObjects</b></p>
<p><b>Any idea how to work around this that it should not get that objects</b></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 12, 2011</h2><p>CSLA uses the Microsoft-defined attribute (Browsable(false)) to indicate which fields should be ignored by data binding. Unfortunately not all Microsoft data binding technologies honor that attribute. If that attribute isn&#39;t honored, you need to tell the datagrid control to stop auto-generating the columns and you need to define the columns yourself. That is typically done by using the column editor available from the Columns property in the control&#39;s properties window.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
