<P>I'm binding an EditableRootList to a ListView and a ContentControl.&nbsp; The ListView shows a list of the items in the collection, and the ContentControl displays the details via a DataTemplate.&nbsp; It works great until I tell the two controls to bind to a SortedBindingList.</P>
<P>When I remove an item from either the SBL or the ERL, the item is removed from the ListView, but the removed item still appears in the ContentControl (detail data ).&nbsp; It looks like all the events for ListChanges are getting raised as expected, so I'm suprised it's not working.</P>
<P>Has anyone already ran into this problem?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JZuerlein replied on Sunday, December 07, 2008</h2><P>It looks like the problem was caused because I was calling Remove(T item) rather then RemoveAt(int index).&nbsp; The Remove(T item) just removes the item from the collection.&nbsp; It doesn't check to see if the list is sorted, or raise the OnListChanged event.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyone know why Remove doesn't have the same behavior as RemoveAt?</P>
