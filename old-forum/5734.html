<P>Obviously, these aren't known at compile time and I'm currently implementing my own infrastructure to support them (and I expose them via ICustomTypeDescriptor, but will be switching over to ITypedList). </P>
<P>If I could just register these with CSLA instead, I could eliminate my own dynamic field tracking mechanism. </P>
<P>I'd think the answer would be, yes this is OK, but just wanted verification that this was considered a legitimate thing to do. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 05, 2008</h2><P>I think you should be able to use the field manager and field registration to simplify the implementation of a dynamically shaped type, yes.</P>
<P>Inside your business class (or base class) you should be able to interact with the field manager to get a list of registered properties, which you could then expose through your interface (ITypedList, etc) in the expected format.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
