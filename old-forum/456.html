<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>hi,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Looking through the templates, I noticed there is 
no implementation for a read only child list. Of course the read only list can 
be modified to be a child list, but just wondering if such an implementation was 
looked over.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The situation is that I have a 
SelectedCategoryInformation object that is created when a user selects a 
category. This object&nbsp; allows for listing of subcategories and of products 
under that category, all of which are read only.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Also, I noticed that, though the read only list 
implementation uses SafeDataReader, ReadOnlyChild uses SqlDataReader, oddly 
enough. Just a couple of observations.</FONT></DIV>

You are correct that a ROLB might be a child - in which case you just need to use the child-style factory and data access approaches shown in other objects in the book.</P>
<P>Regarding the different datareader objects - when writing the book I tried to use a variety of different approaches in different areas. As an author, I was trying to show the various ways to do things. In a real app I alwasy recommend picking a consistent, appropriate, approach and sticking with that.</P>
<P>As a bigger example, I try not to mix Guid and Identity primary keys in my apps - I'll try to pick one approach or the other. Mixing various PK styles is just asking for confusion. But in the book I felt the need to show both, because the implementation is different in each case.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
