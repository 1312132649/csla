I do know that CslaDataSource hasn&#39;t changed in any meaningful way for several years, and I have a Web Forms app running in CSLA 4 - which is the same CslaDataSource as 3.8.</p>
<p>What exactly are you trying to do that triggers this exception?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dec698 replied on Thursday, August 12, 2010</h2><p>Sorry if I wasnt very clear on my post, I&#39;ve read this article&nbsp;<a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/081110-1.aspx">http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/081110-1.aspx</a>&nbsp;on how u could use the queryExtender control to filter data, on that article it says it only works on EntityDataSource or LinqToSql DataSource but still I give it a go and tried to use it using CslaDataSource and then when I hit the page comes that exception.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, August 12, 2010</h2><p>This is not something I&#39;ve researched.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dec698 replied on Thursday, August 12, 2010</h2><p>I do understand, but is this something you think worth adding support to CslaDataSource in the near future?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, August 12, 2010</h2><p>I just glanced at the web page you referenced. This is not something that is supported by CSLA at all - the idea of applying a where clause on the client to what is basically server-side code. CSLA is not an ORM, and there&#39;s no way to do a LINQ query against CSLA objects such that it translates to a SQL query in the database - which is what&#39;s happening with EF and L2S.</p>
<p>In short, this concept doesn&#39;t translate out of the ORM space, and so doesn&#39;t translate into CSLA.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
