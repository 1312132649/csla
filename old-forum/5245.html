<OL>
<LI>Data portal</LI>
<LI>UndoableBase</LI>
<LI>DataMapper</LI></OL>
<P>In 3.5 and higher, the data portal (which is the most critical of the 3) uses dynamic method invocation to avoid reflection. That's thanks in large part to Ricky Supit, a long-time member of the forum, who helped me get that implemented.</P>
<P>The DataMapper is next on my target list - but I haven't had time to work on it yet.</P>
<P>UndoableBase would benefit greatly, but since undo is almost always a pure client-side behavior, wasting some CPU cycles on the client isn't such a big deal.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
