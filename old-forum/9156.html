<p>I&#39;m looking for some direction on how best to mock csla objects, especially between a root and its children.&nbsp; I&#39;m under the impression that to effectively do this kind of testing, one really needs to take advantage of the ObjectFactory way of doing things.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Can someone that&#39;s been through this give some advice on how to proceed?&nbsp; I have an existing Csla project where I&#39;d like to more seperate the unit tests (currently the tests are more like integration tests, because the db is required and a test is really checking a root and it&#39;s children at the same time).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have some generated C# NUnit test templates that were contributed that could be used as a reference. They need some work... but they are a starting point for anyone looking for unit testing. You can download them <a href="http://community.codesmithtools.com/nightly/csla/">here</a>. I&#39;m currently investigating this user <a href="http://code.google.com/p/codesmith/issues/detail?id=426">submitted sample</a> that uses mocking.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
