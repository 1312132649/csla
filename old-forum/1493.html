<P class=MsoNormal>Rather than having this method he could also have implemented an indexer and simply use the “new” keyword so that the compiler wouldn’t complain about hiding inherited members.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Never the less he didn’t, so my question is, anyone knows why did he decide to go that way? Why not an indexer? Is hiding inherited members one of those obscure object oriented nono practice? </P>
