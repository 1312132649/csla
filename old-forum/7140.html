I'm not alone in thinking it is one of the best improvements to the language in recent memory, and I can't imagine coding without it.</P>
<P>In my view, the compiler is finally smart enough to do something this trivial, thereby saving me a lot of typing and effort, and making my code more agile and maintainable.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, June 23, 2009</h2>When I had to translate the C# code to VB I did not have too much trouble with var. In fact many of the technical reviewers suggested using type inference in more places in the VB code - especially when it was crystal clear what the type would be simply by looking at the right hand side of the statement. In a couple of places they thought the type was unclear and the readability of the code could be improved by declaring it fully. But that was a very small subset.<br /><br />Joe</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 23, 2009</h2>I try not to use var/Dim (type inference) when the type is clearly<br />ambiguous:<br /><br />var x = 1;<br /><br />what is that? An int? A double? A long? A short? Who knows...<br /><br />var x = "Hi there";<br /><br />that's very clear - it is a string, and it saved me some typing.<br /><br />var x = new InvoicePoster();<br /><br />I think that is very clear, and in fact brings C# into line with VB in terms<br />of typing less<br /><br />Dim x As New InvoicePoster<br /><br />This syntax has been around for over 10 years, and I think is entirely<br />clear.<br /><br />var x = CustomerEdit.GetCustomer(123);<br /><br />I think that's very clear too, and now it saved me a lot of typing. Is it a<br />CustomerEdit or an ICustomerEdit? I don't know, but honestly I don't care<br />either, and that's why this is (imo) good coding. I could change the factory<br />to switch between those types, and assuming I'm reasonably competent in<br />terms of my OO design, it will not only work fine, but my life was<br />substantially easier by using var.<br /><br />Rocky</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
