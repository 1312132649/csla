It is easier to read.<br /><br />I recently did a lot of work with C# though and I could appreciate its terseness. There were 2-3 things it was easier to express in C#. Automatic properties and multi-line lambdas come to mind.<br /><br />On the flip side VB has XML literals which are amazing. VB already supports dynamic languages. I think they are adding that to C# - I can't wait to hear all the comments from C# devs who think that will be a good thing - after slamming VB for years for having it!!<br /><br />But MS has stated that the 2 languages are going to converge so that each will be able to do what the other can. I think they found this short divergence to be more of a headache and so they plan to get them on the same trajectory.<br /><br />Joe</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Tuesday, March 24, 2009</h2><P>I've written both&nbsp;C++ and VB 6 applications in the past. C# is a fairly natural evolution from C++, but VB.NET is quite a departure from VB 6. I mention the previous languages only in case that might be a bias factor.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I see the difference between them now as being mainly syntactical and a matter of preference. C# seems more explicit to me -- less (if anything) is being done&nbsp;"behind the scenes"&nbsp;--&nbsp;and possibly requires less typing, although Intellisense, etc. are rendering that pretty moot at this point. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SouthSpawn replied on Wednesday, March 25, 2009</h2><DIV>Thanks for the discussion guys, very insightful.</DIV>
