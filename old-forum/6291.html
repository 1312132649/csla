But the fact that the project builds is a major step toward productive work, because finally we're at a point where the compiler can help find issues.<br><br>The team's next step is to get the cslatest project to compile against the VB codebase. While a great many of the tests will surely fail, again it will be a major step to at least be able to build and run the set of unit tests against the codebase.<br><br>Once all that's done, the team should be able to divide the work by functional area and/or unit test groups, and work through the process of making everything actually work. While that is still a lot of work, it will be far easier to do when the first test of any change is whether the Csla and cslatest projects both continue to build.<br><br>It is not entirely clear whether the VB conversion project will be complete before the <i>Expert VB 2008 Business Objects</i> book is done, because the book is going through the various final review stages at this point, and should (hopefully) be available in March. But given all the recent progress on the VB coding project, I think there's a fighting chance that the two efforts will be done at the same time.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>reagan123 replied on Friday, January 30, 2009</h2>Great news!&nbsp; Thanks for the update.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
