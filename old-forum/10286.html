<p>Browsing the <strong>Object </strong>ebook I noticed there is no mention to Editable Switchable.</p>
<p>I guess this stereotype is supported by CSLA.NET 4. Why didn&#39;t you include it?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bniemyjski replied on Wednesday, April 20, 2011</h2><p>Hello,</p>
<p>That is a good question, I also did not see it in the list (I&#39;m using an older version of the objects book). I know it is supported in 4.x, maybe it was forgotten??</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I consider it an advanced scenario that should be generally avoided - I think I&#39;ve been consistent about that for years :)</p>
<p>Rather than put it out there as a first-class stereotype, and therefore make people think they should use it, I chose to leave it out - thus hopefully encouraging more thought around better object designs.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
