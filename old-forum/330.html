<P>I searched the book and the forum, but couldn't find anything.</P>
<P>I added an EditableChildCollection to my EditableRoot. I successfully added EditableChild items to the collection using .AddNew(). Now I need to save these when I save the EditableRoot.</P>
<P>I was hoping this would be done automatically, but I guess that's not the case. What do I need to do? Should it be similar to cloning and saving as discussed on page 491 in the C# book?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
