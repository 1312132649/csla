<p>Before upgrading from 4 to 4.5, exceptions coming back from the data portal would have the message of the original exception such as &quot;Another user has modified the row in Table1, update failed&quot;.&nbsp; Now all that comes back&nbsp;as the message is than an Async Error occurred (the message is blank and the exception is thrown from System.Runtime.CompilerServices.AsyncServices.&lt;ThrowAsync&gt;).&nbsp; There is&nbsp;no detail as to the problem.&nbsp; The Async exception doesn&#39;t contain the original exception:&nbsp; there is no internal exception.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If something happens on the server like it cannot connect to SQL Server or some UNC path doesn&#39;t exist, no message is returned to the UI to indicate the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I would REALLY like an example on how to get the exception back or an explanation of what I may be doing wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
