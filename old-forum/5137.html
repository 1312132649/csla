In the Data Source Configuration Wizard, I chose the Object I want to bind to. Then, before I even press the "Next" button to add the datasource, the wizard just closes and the datasource is not added. <br><br>The weird thing is that I can add some datasources, but not all. And the datasources I can't add, are datasources that I previously has been added, but then they mysteriously dissapeared from the datasources list. <br><br>This makes thigs very hard for me, since I cant add new properties to my forms and reportViewer. Is there anyone who knows what to do to fix this, or a workaround so I at least can get acces to my properties so I can add them to my forms and ReportViewer?<br><br>TremoToT<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, July 23, 2008</h2><P>Not sure if this will help but...</P>

That causes a lot of grief when selecting datasources (and usually kicks you out of the wizard). Maybe the best thing to do is the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Delete all datasources from your project</LI>
<LI>Delete all your project dll files</LI>
<LI>Add a new user control and add a bindingsource</LI>
<LI>1 by 1 add all your previously used datasources</LI></UL>
<P>Hope this helps</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
