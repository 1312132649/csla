<p>I am posting this message on behalf of Rocky and his family.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Rocky went to the ER at Fairview hospital at around 3:00 am on the 24th with chest pains. He was admitted, and examined for possible heart attack. It was discovered that he had a tear aneurysm with dissection in his ascending aeortic arch. Surgery was performed to repair the artery. He is recovering nicely, but it&acute;ll be some time before he can respond to question</i>s.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>st3fanus replied on Friday, July 26, 2013</h2><p>Hi.. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all rooting for you!</p>
<p>I guess we&#39;re all wondering - when Rocky&#39;s released from the hospital, what release number will that be? 5.0, 5.1 ... </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad the docs just called BypassPropertyChecks and got straight on with fixing him. <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>edreyes77 replied on Sunday, July 28, 2013</h2><p>Rocky. &nbsp;Prayers and best wishes are all I can provide in these moments. &nbsp;I hope all outcomes are the best for you and your family. &nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, August 02, 2013</h2><p>Thank you all for you kind (and good humored) thoughts, I appreciate them very much!</p>
<p>I am now at home recovering, and that will probably take 12 weeks. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll feel pretty good earlier than that, and it turns out that using computers isn&#39;t too physically demanding ;). My bigger challenge in the short term are all the meds and the fact that I tire out extremely fast.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sergeyb replied on Friday, August 02, 2013</h2><p>Just take good care of yourself, Rocky. &nbsp;There will be plenty of time for you to work soon enough.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>nhwilly replied on Friday, August 02, 2013</h2><p>At least it&#39;s not in January. :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>nhwilly replied on Friday, August 02, 2013</h2><p>I have always&nbsp;deeply respected Rocky, his work and his incredibly generous contributions to the community.&nbsp; After I read his first book, I put him on a bit of a pedestal.&nbsp; And bought all the other books and videos just to try and absorb some of it.</p>
<p>I once flew to a CSLA training session in Atlanta just so I could meet him.&nbsp; I was not disappointed&nbsp;and I came away knowing that he truly is a giant in the IT world.</p>
<p>I am so sorry to hear that he&#39;s gone through this and so encouraged that he&#39;s recovering.</p>
<p>Best wishes to him and his family.</p>
<p>Get well, Rocky!</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
