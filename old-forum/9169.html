<p>If I am looking at things correctly, it looks like to target silverlight you end up with two business layer assemblies.&nbsp;&nbsp; One with the full blown BO definition, but with the DP_xyz methods instead an if !SILVERLIGHT directive, and another Silverlight class library with the files from the .Net version linked in.</p>
<p>That seems fine.&nbsp; I&#39;m setting up my intermediate BO layer though following this pattern, and my unit test project is currently referencing the full .Net layer.&nbsp; Is there any need to do the same test for the Silverlight side BO, since it&#39;s the same?&nbsp; What if there&#39;s an issue only appearing in SL?</p>
<p>Anyone else come across this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Thru i have a research comming where i&#39;ve to dive into unit testing business objects in both WPF and Silverlight. There is alot to research and i hope u will share some <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink" /></p>
<p>Anyway i think there isn&#39;t any issue testing for Silverlight, you just have to make sure all your factory methods are using the ASync dataportal. Make sure your unit tests are expecting ASync behaviour.</p>
<p>Please take a look at a blog i found about ASync unit testing, seems it is really usefull.<br /><a href="http://blog.cloudsiders.com/2010/03/unit-testing-async-calls-multithreading-and-rewriting-delegates-with-expression-trees/">http://blog.cloudsiders.com/2010/03/unit-testing-async-calls-multithreading-and-rewriting-delegates-with-expression-trees/</a></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
