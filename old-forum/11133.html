The style gets its information from PropertyInfo and uses that information to control the appearance of the TextBox control.</p>
<p>The WpUI project in ProjectTracker uses it as well, because the whole point of creating PropertyInfo was to support Windows Phone. It just happens to be really useful for WPF/SL projects too.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
