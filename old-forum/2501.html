</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Saturday, March 10, 2007</h2>You say "after <b>adding</b> Inherits WinPart"... Did you change the inherits line in the designer's partial class or just added that in the standard class?<br><br>Sounds like the same class has 2 inherits lines in 2 different partial classes.<br>You can also avoid this issues by choosing add -&gt; Component in your project and then choose "inherited user control". That'll show you a list of available user controls to inherit from.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Lazor replied on Monday, March 12, 2007</h2>I recompiled but the problem presists.&nbsp; However I tried adding the component and that worked fine.&nbsp; I'm still puzzled - I just added a user control to the PTWin project, and added the inherits WinPart.&nbsp; However since the adding component worked - I won't lose sleep.&nbsp; Thanks guys for the help.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Monday, March 12, 2007</h2>Ok, I think you missed the partial class thing. Notice how when you open up the code for the usercontrol, you just get the class definition and nothing else? It doesn't even say "Inherits UserControl". That's because there's a second partial class that's hidden by default that contains all the designer generated code and the "inherits" line. You need to toogle "Show all files" on (second button in solution explorer's toolbar) and you'll be able to expand the user control. Open the ".Designer.vb" file and you'll be able to see that....<br><br>I hope that solves your issue!<br><br>Andrés<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
