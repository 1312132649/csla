This container could be a standard BB object with its own rules. Since it contains the ERLB object it could have a rule that runs over the list and checks for uniqueness and prevents saving otherwise. This container is called various things (Unit of Work, Use Case Controller, etc.) It has a single factory method (create or fetch) and it instantiates all contained BOs. Save on the container gets you to the DataPortal where you can then save the contained objects. But if you go this far then why not just have a regular child collection? At least those objects won't try and save themselves as you edit them!<br /><br />Joe<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
