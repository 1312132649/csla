I have a business list that when created has some attributes pulled out of a config file. One of those attributes is a flag indicating that it should be fixed length. So if the attribute specifies 20 for a length, I need to be able to say that the min and max length is 20, so no adding or removing of items. Is this easy to do?? Thanks in advance!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, August 28, 2013</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>The short answer is NO. </p>
<p>I would recommend to create your own base class that derives from ReadOnlyListBase / ReadPnlyBindingListBase and implement the necessary interfaces to be used in the same manner as BusinessListBase. </p>
<p>Basically you need to implement the Csla.Core.ITrackStatus interface and additionally the Child_Update method if you use DataPortal_XYZ for DataAccess. </p>
<p>With a read only list you load the fixed number of items and after this the collection is ReadOnly so no items can be removed or added.</p>
