I'm not sure if there is an equivalent solution for the GridView, but if there is one, it will involve changing some setting of the GridView to force it to post the cell value to the bound object any time the cell value is changed.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
