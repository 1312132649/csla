Trying to learn how CSLA wants you to develop can be difficult and is not something that will just come to you overnight, but over time it will be make more and more sense as you begin to use it.</p>
<p>The training videos that are available make the information much easier to absorb, compared to the book. The books are an excellent resources, but trying to learn the framework just from the books alone can be a frustrating and time consuming process. The sample applications are also a good place to learn some of the quirks of the newer UI&#39;s (silverlight / WPF).</p>
<p>If you can give us some more information about a specific problem you are having, we are happy to point you in the right direction.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, January 18, 2011</h2><p>I would also recommend the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/MainPage.ashx">CSLA FAQ</a> and search the forum for similar discussions before you post.

<p>I realize my cry for help was very vague but I was not sure what else to do. Currently I&#39;m responsible for an application that was written in CSLA 2.0 and I have gone deep into maintainance mode since I&#39;m not brave enough to do any new development.&nbsp; I need a step by step with screen shot tutorial or something easy to follow so that I can gain confindence and develope quality applications using this framework. Do you suggest a step by step approach to this? Thanks in advance.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
