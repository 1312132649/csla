I don&#39;t remember where I have read it. Since then I was using my projects in release config only. </p>
<p>Can anybody if this is correct ? and if yes then what was the reason for this ?</p>
<p>But Now due to some req, i have to change it to Debug configuration while testing.. Once product is ready to publish only then i will change it to Release config.</p>
<p>Can anybody pls cfm if it is ok to test project like this and I won&#39;t be getting any unexpected errors if i switch to Release config.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Turntwo replied on Wednesday, June 22, 2011</h2><p>I switch between Release and Debug all time and haven&#39;t encountered any errors.&nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, June 22, 2011</h2><p>I don&#39;t remember any such requirement.&nbsp; It shouldn&#39;t matter if you use Debug vs Release.</p>
<p>There was an issue some people had on the older code base when they did use release, the application would no longer function.&nbsp; That was due to using CanReadProperty / CanWriteProperty calls which didn&#39;t take a property name, and so used the stack trace to determine this.</p>
<p>However, release mode would do an optimization known as inlining, which basically takes code in your property get or set and embeds it directly into the caller, for performance reasons.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The solution was to stop using those methods and always specify the propery name, or an alternative would be to use an attribute to tell the compiler not to inline.</p>
<p>Newer versions of Csla which use the PropertyInfo should not suffer from these problems.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Thursday, June 23, 2011</h2><p>Thanks for the details.. My projects are all using now the new syntax of propertyinfo, so I think it will not be a problem.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
