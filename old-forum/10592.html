<p>Right now we&#39;re experimenting with relatively low-volume Silverlight &amp; WPF apps for learning, but we&#39;re looking at moving our main order entry application from VB6 to WPF/CSLA 4.1 within the next year, and it is a very high-volume app and performance is critical.</p>

I discuss this in the <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration</em> ebook.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Friday, August 05, 2011</h2><p>In the e-book, you also talk about AppFabric.&nbsp; Does AppFabric use WAS?&nbsp; Would it be recommended to use AppFabric instead of <em>just</em> WAS?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, August 05, 2011</h2><p>Right now I don&#39;t know that AppFabric adds that much (unless you need the specific features it offers). But strategically I suspect it is the best option, because AppFabric is the technology under which Microsoft is slowly providing some parity between Windows Server and Windows Azure.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
