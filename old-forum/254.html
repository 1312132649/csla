<P>After using the reporting Services and finding it quite "quirky" when it came to printing I have been&nbsp;working with it&nbsp;and have found it to be very "friendly" and easy to use.&nbsp; Alot easier then Active Reports was with Net 1.x&nbsp; and without the cost of Active Reports&nbsp;V 2.0</P>
<P>Granted, I haven't done much with fancy reports but have created a number of reports with multiple sub reports and so far so good.</P>
<P>The issue I see is in the startup time of the first report to be run. After that they load quick.&nbsp;Setting the datasource to a collection or object just takes one short line of code.</P>
<P>Creating an Install package, again using VS2005, allows you to package Crystal Runtime as part of the process.&nbsp; After installing once, any updates do not need to include the Crystal Runtime.</P>
<P>I was just wondering what others think</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, June 08, 2006</h2>Has anyone used Crystal with VS2005 and Csla (besidse BillG)?<br><br>I'm going to need to do reporting soon and was exploring this as an option.&nbsp; If anyone has other options I'd be open to hearing them as well.&nbsp; One thought I had would be to embed the browser control and have some 'reporting' objects which can spit out XML and my report can use Xslt to tranform them to Html.<br><br>Reports will not be just standard 'what did we sell this month', but would also include a printable invoice for an order, RMA, etc.<br><br>So, what has everyone done for these kinds of requirements?<br><br>One final requirement for my project; the solution must be deployable via ClickOnce.<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Thursday, June 08, 2006</h2>Andy,<br><br>You know I've been toying with that idea in my mind for months...

<P>As far as the ease</P>
<P>I create the report in the same project a s the business object is, this lets Crystaql see it.<BR>Once I have the basic fields I can move the report files and access them from the Windows or web&nbsp; application.(My apps are all using windows but a new one I am about to start leverages off what I have done and puts it onto the web</P>
<P>Deployment is only an issue on the initial install and you can include the required files in the setup.&nbsp; This is much like the process for Report Viewer.</P>
<P>I am finding Crystal quite good for the reports I need in a number of deployed applications</P>
<P>Business Objects may have heard the .NET and Object Developers and this attempt seems to be headed in the right direction</P>

A report control that's part of .net should be the solution to my problems.

<P>ReportList &amp; ReportInfo - the list would simply recurse a folder to find all RPT files and get some basic information that's displayed on a grid.</P>
<P>Report object - this will load in an RPT file when the report is selected in the grid and provides the parameter collection etc. Then I just display the report in the CrystalReportViewer control.</P>
<P>Job done.</P>

<br>
I have done the report via Xml and Xslt before, although this was in a
web application.&nbsp; I did something similar for a windows application,
but more as a proof of concept than anything else.&nbsp; One problem is that
you don't really have any control over printing;&nbsp; you end up with the
Url at the bottom of the pages, etc.<br>
<br>
I wanted to look into ReportViewer and Crystal because of the added
features, such as Export to Xls and Pdf.. also because we could install
Report Server (Sql Server 2k5) and utilize that as well, which would
make management happy since we're getting more value for the money we
spent on the server.&nbsp; It seems like it'd be pretty easy to move from
client reports to server reports down the road if we wanted.<br>

<P>The problem I have relates to filters.&nbsp; Parameters in reports are painful to me, so I typically do in-memory filters / sorts, or make a DB trip with the appropriate filters.</P>
