<P>The multiview shows the grid with the current child objects and it also shows a view for the insert functionality.&nbsp; If the object is invalid on the insert screen it will still insert it into the collection (but not save it to the database) so that I've an invalid object in the collection.</P>
<P>That means I've the error message (or broken rules) showing up on the grid view screen when I'd rather have it show up on the insert screen <EM>- and prevent the insertion until the object is valid.</EM>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could create the object behind the DataSource.InsertObject event and not add it to the collection if it is invalid, I suppose -&nbsp; I dunno - I'd like to get some input on how others handle the creation of objects on the web and how broken rules are communicated to the end user.</P>
<P>Thoughts?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
