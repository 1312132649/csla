Its quite interesting to see a new framework that makes use of the powerful .net features. I came across the site when i happened to look for my work around for my task.</P>
<P>I am using .NET 2.0, IIS 6.0 running in Windows XP SP2. Is this software versions sufficient to use the CSLA .NET framework? </P>
<P>Also is there any option to use get the evaluation license key so that I can able to work to see whether it meets my requirement?</P>
<P>Could anyone suggest me where to start so that I can able to use the features of CSLA framework? </P>
<P>I have downloaded the document expert-one-on-one-visual-basic-net-business-objects.pdf and reviewing the same.</P>
<P>Best Regards</P>

<P>#1 - You really have to buy the book if you want to understand what CSLA is. Rocky originally wrote CSLA as a sample framework (to sell the book)&nbsp;and it has changed over the years to a fully supported one.</P>
<P>#2 - CSLA is free. No license required.</P>
<P>#3 - Your hardware is fine for CSLA 2.x. Rocky is about to publish CSLA 3.5.</P>
<P>#4 - After reading the CSLA 2005 book you should get the eBook directly from Rocky to see the enhancements made since then. </P>
<P>#5 - Then read this forum to see his latest thinking.</P>
<P>#6 - Rocky provides a sample app named Project Tracker to demo the features of CSLA.</P>
<P>If you are writing a line of business app then, in my opinion,&nbsp;CSLA is probably the best framework to use.</P>

I am trying to follow the stuff in the PDF document its quite informative.</P>
<P>Its mean that without violating the License information it should be used am I right?</P>
