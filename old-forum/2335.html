<P>Well it's about time I put my hand in pocket , so to speak, and paid Andrés (xal) back for CSLA Gen.</P>
<P>If you take your browser to <A href="http://www.cslagenwiki.com">http://www.cslagenwiki.com</A> you should all get a pleasant surprise.</P>
<P>Please have fun and correct any mistakes I may have made.</P>
<P>The only thing I ask is that you keep things neat and tidy and that you don't blow away everything I've written up already ( not that you would... but I'm just saying in case anyone out there likes their delete key too much LOL).</P>
<P>Any problems just let me know as it's the first time i've installed and used MediWiki in anger so it may have some "features" that need ironed out.</P>
<P>Cheers<BR>Chris</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Wednesday, February 14, 2007</h2><P>this site &nbsp;is having very useful stuff about csla gen (and it needed one). Thanks for putting all the effort..</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fretje replied on Wednesday, February 14, 2007</h2><P>How come is this the first thing&nbsp;I hear about this really wonderful tool?</P>
<P>I recently posted a question about code generation in the forum specialized for that kind of stuff (<A HREF="/forums/thread/11416.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/11416.aspx</A>) but it seems like not a lot of people know about this, or maybe there are not a lot people who read the other forums?</P>
<P>Anyway, this is just what I needed, thanks !</P>

<P>The other problem is that non one knew how to drive it as it had no documentation.</P>
<P>Thats where I came in :)</P>
<P>Glad you like it and I am planning on extending/completing section three with examples of how to generate each type of object.&nbsp; If I get time I'm planning a full 'case study' in section four but we'll see how my time goes.</P>
<P>Cheers</P>

<p>Try <a href="http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com/">http://cslagenfork.codeplex.com/</a></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Thursday, February 15, 2007</h2><P>This is some awesome work, Chris.&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I've barely started my new templates for CSLA 2.x in MyGeneration and now I have to think seriously about whether it's really worth my time to build my own.</P>
<P>You've put the CodeSmith templates within my reach with this huge effort of yours.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I was reluctant to use it before because I thought I'd have to write my own templates&nbsp;(because I couldn't figure out how to run the ones that were available for 1.x for each of the BO types).&nbsp; Since I'm a winforms guy, the ASP-like syntax of CodeSmith wasn't nearly as agreeable to me as just writing the templates in MyGeneration using good old VB.NET.</P>
<P>Now I REALLY have a choice.&nbsp; And even if I write templates for MyGeneration later, I can be productive in 2.x in really short order with these (until I finish my own if I ever have a need for them).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thanks to you and, of course, to the guys that built and tweaked those great templates!&nbsp; </P>
