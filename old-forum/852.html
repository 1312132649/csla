<DIV align=left><SPAN class=640001422-09082006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>Especially given that you need to follow the model in the 
book (w/ errata) where you unbind first - to get the bindingsource objects back 
to their original state - and then rebind. On the other hand, you should be able 
to ONLY bind the root object, and the rest should rebind by themselves, so I 
guess in that light it isn't so terribly bad.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
