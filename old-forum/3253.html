I was just wondering if somebody can describe a pattern on doing this.<BR>In my case I have an EditableRoot object (Client) which can be moved from a number of stages (e.g. Stage 1, Stage 2...) and the move is subject to validation and authorization rules and finally creates an audit trail (EditableChildList ClientHistory).<BR>I thought of creating a WorkflowClient (EditableRoot containing a WorkflowClientHistoryList-EditableChildList)&nbsp; and in addition have a ClientWorkflowController that would contain static methods such as: <BR>public static bool CanMove(WorkflowClient client, string fromStage, string toStage)<BR>public static void Move(WorkflowClient client, string toStage)</P>
<P>But I can't help thinking this is sloppy (though its the best I can think right now). If anybody has implemented something similar or can point me somewhere that would be greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>Also, what would be really cool if there are any suggestions on how to minimize the effort if I finally get .Net 3.0 enabled servers and decide to use WF :-)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, July 24, 2007</h2>This <a HREF="/forums/thread/13806.aspx">thread</a> is similar to what you are trying to do, although without WF.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triplea replied on Wednesday, July 25, 2007</h2><P>Thanks for the link ajj3085. So in my case I guess I will have the following objects then:</P>
<UL>
<LI>WorkflowClientEdit (EditableRoot) which will contain the client data at whatever stage it is.</LI>
<LI>ClientWorkflowController (similar to your CO2I object) with an IsMoveableToStage property responsible for moving a WorkflowClientEdit from 1 stage to another, do validation and history tracking. Also it will contain the MoveToStage() method to actually do so.</LI></UL>
<P>And hopefully one day I will be able to replace ClientWorkflowController with a workflow in WF with not too much convertion work... </P>
<P>Hope the new CSLA ebook contains some WF examples/suggestions :-)</P>
