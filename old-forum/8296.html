To be exact, AsyncRuleHandler is is being called as many times as there are ValidationRules.AddRule calls placed AFTER that AsyncRule call in AddBusinessRules override. So, if I put AsyncRuleHandler as last call in AddBusinessRules method, async rule is being called correctly, only once.<br><br>Am I missing something here? <br><br>Thanks<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mesh replied on Thursday, January 07, 2010</h2>I was wrong, in some situations my code was not calling context.Complete().<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
