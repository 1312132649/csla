Use BusinessListBase, which does require you to call Save() on the root object to save all the objects in the collection.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, October 12, 2006</h2>Ahh, sorry.&nbsp; I had assumed you upgraded, but didn't think you would have switched to using that superclass.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kreed replied on Thursday, October 12, 2006</h2>Gotcha.&nbsp; Thanks so much.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
