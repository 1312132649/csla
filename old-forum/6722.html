If&nbsp;I log in as User/user and click on "Add Company" the app will happily take&nbsp;me to the company edit screen. There of course&nbsp;I cannot save since the Save button is disabled. Then if&nbsp;I click Close and again Add Company, I get the authorization message telling me I cannot create a new company - twice.</P>
<P>It appears that AddAuthorizationRules() is called after the initial&nbsp;call to CreateCompany&nbsp;(even after the call to DataPortal_Create) has finished so the first time the authorization check on AllowCreate is missed. This brings back memories of the _dummy field but I am still getting to grips with 3.6.x so not entirely sure...</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
