You can <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=c09023e0-cf98-4979-861f-b917f253c180">download it here</A>.</P>
<P><FONT>When I say preview, I really mean it!!</FONT> This is rough stuff, with few comments and subject to radical change (though I hope not). Read the two change logs to see what's been done to CSLA .NET and what is there (and not there) in CSLA Light.</P>
<P>In short, what we have working is a subset of the data portal (BusinessBase/BusinessListBase/CriteriaBase), object cloning&nbsp;and n-level undo. </P>
<P>Maybe a little data binding, maybe not (it is there, but totally untested).</P>
<P>No validation. No authorization (we need to invent authentication first).</P>
<P>To use CSLA .NET 3.6 you need VS 2008 w/ .NET 3.5 SP1 (at least that's our test environment).</P>
<P>To use CSLA Light you need VS 2008 w/ Silverlight Beta 2 and the VS tools for Silverlight.</P>
<P>cslalighttest includes a custom unit testing engine - see the change log for why - but it is kind of neat.</P>
<P>For "documentation" see my <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CategoryView,category,Silverlight.aspx">blog posts</A> over the past couple months, but don't expect anything beyond my ramblings about design decisions.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
