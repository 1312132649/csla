It is possible
that the child objects will have no records in the database. In this
case I am having trouble binding a member of the child object to a
control. <br>
<br>
In the editable root I get the child like:<br>
<br>
mChild = ChildBO.GetChild(ID, True)<br>
<br>
If there are no corresponding database records I get a child object
with string fields that are Nothing. The problem comes when I try to
bind the fields in the ChildBO to controls. <br>
<br>
Any suggestions on the best way to handle this?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>

It's a must if you're using databinding.<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>gmclean replied on Monday, June 05, 2006</h2>Thanks Andres - It is always simple once someone points out the answer!<br>
