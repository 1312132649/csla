<P>I have an object called Review that represents an employee's annual review. It contains a state machine that decides what actions a user can perform on the object. The decision is based on internal object data, a supervisor hierarchy tree, role information in the identity object, and the history of actions that have been performed on the review.</P>
<P>Creating all the test objects in the scope of a transaction to verify the state machine works correctly is a nightmare. I created an identity "doubler" to ease the burden of creating identity objects for the assorted user personas, but that took a while, and it feels like I'm going to end up writing a lot of code to perform the tests.</P>
<P>I'm curious to find out what other people do to deal with this type of problem. Any suggestions?</P>
