<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Just set my account up and this is gonna be such a fantastic change to what we are used to.&nbsp; I'm glad to see that Rocky has still got a link in place to the old forum so that if it proves too difficult to port the old messages here we can still get at them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Actually with my knowledge of how dodgy data migration can be due to quality of data I think it might be an idea just to leave the old stuff where it is and continue afresh?&nbsp; Just in case the ported messages do not come over in a legible format. After all we do have Terrences search engine for the old site.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>Am I being terribly controvesial here?&nbsp; I don't think so... what do other folks think?</FONT></P>

<P>The only downside to that is that anyone waiting on feedback from a thread wouldn't get it but it would not be hard from them to restart the thread here.</P>

<p>ChrisD</p></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>FWIW: I agree with the idea of locking down the old forum .... certainly aids to clearity when all new posts go in one place. <br><br>I just guess it is slightly early to 'commit' entirely to the new forum already.
