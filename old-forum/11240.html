<p>They return more fields then&nbsp;necessary, even when we are doing explicit selects, and there also seems to be some funkiness with the joins.</p>

<p>Wondering if anyone has been able to implement Simple.Data as the data layer in your CSLA project.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, March 20, 2012</h2><p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>I do not have any experience with Simple.Data but if you get experience then please share it with us and maybe even code on CslaContrib.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Tuesday, March 20, 2012</h2><p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>Simple.Data looks like an interesting technology since it allows easy acces to a lot of database engines with the exact same code. After finishing DAL-DTO, it might be interesting to make CslaGenFork use it for the DAL side.</p>
<p>The only downside is the use of dynamic objects: it does&#39;t make your code run any faster. Then again, maybe it doesn&#39;t slow it that much...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
