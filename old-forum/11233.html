<p>Most interesting videos and forum, waiting to get started pending suggestions from above.</p>
<p>Thanks and best regards,&nbsp; Jack</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, March 16, 2012</h2><p>I also recommend the current v4 series.</p>
<p>The paper books goes more into the inner workings and design of CSLA and the v4 series is focused on how to use CSLA.</p>
<p>And you should also visit the CSLA FAQ. <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/ </a></p>
<p>The 3.8 Videos is mostly applicable and can be nice for a newbie.<br />The rule engine is totally rewritten for 4.x but the other content is still up to &quot;current&quot;.</p>
<p>The Csla 4 MVVM video is nice of you plan on doing WPF or Silverlight applications.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
