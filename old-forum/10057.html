<p>In this scenario, let&#39;s say we have a Customer ER, with an ECC of Addresses. In our use-case we have to have the address collection displayed and edited on the same form as the main customer.</p>
<p>I am using the Telerik MVC controls, and would like to use their grid control for editing the Addresses ECC, which in turn can take a controller / action (either by Ajax or full Server post-back) for each crud operation.</p>
<p>At the moment I can see a couple of ways of doing this but would like to gather thoughts / feedback from anyone who has experience with this particular scenario:</p>
<p>1) Somehow add each entry to the grid client-side and process everything as part of the main form submission (would the model binder know how to handle the grid or would this need to be done manually?)</p>
<p>2) Make the grid call into an action method on the controller either via ajax or post-back for each child that is added / edited / deleted etc, but if this were the case, then I guess I&#39;d have to either keep the whole ER in session or persist it to the db and retrieve it on each request in order to maintain the list of children?</p>
<p>as said, if anyone has any pointers on the best way to handle this scenario in MVC they would be gratefully received.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>The built-in support for collections provided by MVC is (imo) underwhelming. Do third-party controls like the Telerik one provide a better model for dealing with collections?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Friday, February 11, 2011</h2><p><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black;">Using the Telerik MVC 3 grid here with Ajax and I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s edit one row at a time currently - haven&#39;t figured out if its possible yet - certainly no examples around.&nbsp; So we are pretty much doing option 2.&nbsp; I did see a wish list request on the Telerik site asking for multi-row edit and batch submit, so maybe we&#39;ll get it down the road.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>

<p>How did you get a ER to bind Ajax with the Telerik MVC grid.&nbsp; Whenever I try, I get a circular reference error.&nbsp; It works if I change my ER to a ROR.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t have any help for your problem though.&nbsp; Sorry.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
