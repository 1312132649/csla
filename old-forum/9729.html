<p>I&#39;m evaluating Crystal Reports for Visual Studio 2010 and it seems to be necessary that .Net objects have a public constructor. You know that csla business objects don&#39;t have public constructors. How can you tell Crystal Reports that it has to execute MyObjectList.GetList(parm1, parm2) in design time?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Russ replied on Wednesday, November 17, 2010</h2><p>I&#39;m with Jonny on this one.&nbsp; I have used every version of Crystal Reports since version 1.0.&nbsp;I am now in the process of recreating hundreds of reports using the Microsoft Report Viewer in VS2010.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Phlar replied on Thursday, November 25, 2010</h2><p>Sorry for the late reply OscarLauroba,</p>
<p>We are on a tight deadline and couldn&#39;t respond earlier.&nbsp; Most of our reports are against the database, however the new ones we&#39;re creating (that reference our Business Objects) actually reference a wrapper class since our BO are in a number of distinct projects.&nbsp; I have read that this is required (I believe on SAP&#39;s web site/forum) when your objects are not within the same project.</p>
<p>When I was a Java programmer we utilized another reporting tool (sorry, I don&#39;t recall the name at the present moment) that did not have this limitation but&nbsp;I found Crystal Reports to be a better tool overall.</p>
<p>Hope that helps/answers your question.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Handler replied on Thursday, January 06, 2011</h2><p>I am also curious as to which reporting tool would work best with CSLA Business Objects (BO). Crystal Reports are the current solution, but I am looking for a new solution. Please advise to the most appropriate reporting tool for CSLA BOs.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
