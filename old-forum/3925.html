The only way it will work is by changing authentication to windows but even then when doing a fetch I fail. The only part that works is the initial login fetch from AD.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>checlark replied on Monday, November 26, 2007</h2><P>I am pretty sure I am not the only person who needs to use the wcf portal in Csla. As popular as this framework is I know someone has needed this to work. I am building an entire base framework from which our next product will be built. Any help would be appreciated, my hair is wearing thin.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
