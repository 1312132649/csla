<P>I never used business objects until two weeks before I bought the book.&nbsp; I am currently developing the SQL2005 database, Stored Procedures and Business objects.&nbsp; I even plan&nbsp;adding functionality like IsActive to my&nbsp;objects so I can retire them without deleting them from the database.&nbsp; The book is VERY good and well explained.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Either way, I wish you well.</P>

People are sometimes stuck in their ways, and an official training program can create new excitement<br>
<br>
I do plan to contact Magenic as well.<br>

<P>He was right to some extent in that the repetition is a direct result of CSLA in the first place - you keep coding what's important, like your properties, your validation rules, etc... and not the framwork itself, Rocky did that for all of us.&nbsp; How can coding what is important, and only what is important seems repetitive?&nbsp; The obvious answer is probably that that developer wanted to do what he wanted and not necessarily what his boss wanted him to do :)</P>
<P>Now, I'm a huge fan of CSLA and I will defend it for as long as I can.&nbsp; BUT, make sure your developers DO believe in it - if not, then at the very least beg them to read the book (the cheaper option here) and then, only then, should they be allowed to make a sound evaluation of if CSLA is repetitive or not.</P>
<P>I do&nbsp;believe...&nbsp; do you?&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DesNolan replied on Monday, September 11, 2006</h2>Don't know company, but thought I'd mention, Rocky works for Magenic,
who also offer to assist people with CSLA. I believe a number of
employees there have contributed and used CSLA over the years.<br>
<br>
I wish I'd help myself with the CSLA n-level undo where there's
parent-child-granchildren relationships, that's my big struggle to
overcome at the moment.<br>
<br>
Good luck with your learning, and glad to see there 's multiple sources for that out there.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

Some do need the outside assistance a training program can provide.&nbsp; I know&nbsp;a number of people who work with Dunn Training and all are top notch.</P>
<P>If you are in the Atlanta area, it's too bad you missed out on the series's that the <A href="http://www.avbsg.net">Atlanta VB Study Group </A>have done in the past on CSLA (VB 6 and again in .Net 1.x) I've been doing CSLA in the Atlanta area for 6+ years now, so I might be able to help out if you need.</P>
