I would suggest starting there, and then going through the ProjectTracker sample app in the Samples download (this is the app discussed in the book too).</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Haidarh replied on Sunday, March 22, 2009</h2>Hi Rocky,<br /><br />Thanks for your suggestion. I have seen lots of threads regarding the csla topic. All are not for my level as I am beginner to use this architecture. <br /><br />But as per your suggestion I am going to follow the Expert C# 2008 Business Objects book.<br /><br />Thanks Rocky<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Haidar</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>James Thomas replied on Sunday, March 22, 2009</h2>I'm still making my way up the learning curve, but am on a major application now and am confident it will be reliable and well designed thanks to the discipline of the CSLA framework. I think the best place to start is Rocky's book (the first and last few chapters) to get an overview of the architecture of the framework. I'd then take one of the example applications - the one that's closest in structure to your own scenario - and use that as a template to create your first application. You can copy and paste code to create your own objects and work through it to figure out how it all fits together.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, March 22, 2009</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I&#8217;ll also be releasing a set of videos in the next few weeks,
focused primarily on CSLA .NET for Silverlight, but also largely useful for
Windows work too (since the business object implementation is nearly the same,
and if you are doing WPF, the XAML isn&#8217;t that different either).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If those videos sell reasonably well I will almost certainly do
other videos focused on other topics, such as WPF, ASP.NET, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
