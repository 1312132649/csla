<P>Thanks and thanks for the replies on other posts of mine - I'm trying to port everything i have over to newer versions so i have many 'earmarked' things i want to pursue when I can focus.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, February 04, 2008</h2>What events do you need to unhook?&nbsp; I would think you wouldn't want to unhook a root object listening to its children.&nbsp; Are you talking about other objects listening to the events of a Csla object?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 04, 2008</h2><P>Microsoft defined four attributes you can place on methods to indicate they should be called by the formatter. The OnDeserialized() method is the only one CSLA actually implements, because CSLA needs to react to deserialization. But you can define your own methods (the other three) with appropriate attributes and get notified of all the formatter's activity.</P>
<P>Look in BusinessBase to see how OnDeserialized() is invoked and you'll find the attribute&nbsp;and method signature. Then a little googling should get you the other three attributes and away you go.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jh72i replied on Tuesday, February 05, 2008</h2><P>Thanks for those replies folks.&nbsp; Rocky, as an interim solution I did copy your OnDeserialize... pattern for serialization.&nbsp; That gives me backward compatibility.</P>
<P>ajj3085, mostly I just want to strip down any local connectivity when I send and object(as a data wrapper really) out onto the network.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I do think, once I'm up an running again, that I'll have to rethink this in terms of the serializable/nonserializable event handlers might be doing what i need already.</P>
<P>Thanks again for the input.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
