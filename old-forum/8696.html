<p>At the moment our system can read one object at a time by using the Get method. But this only brings back one object.We want to populate a grid.</p>
<p>What I would like to know, is there a class where you can directly call a method to retrieve all the objects, instead of just one? If not, do you have examples of other possible ways to get this done? Can the fetch be modified to not accept parameters? This way bringing back multiple objects/results.</p>
<p>Thank you</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, March 19, 2010</h2><p>You should read at least Chapters 1-5 of the <i>Expert 2008 Business Objects</i> book, so you get a good overview of all the primary base classes offered by the framework. You want either BusinessListBase or EditableRootListBase, depending on exactly what behavior you want.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>strangerd replied on Saturday, March 20, 2010</h2><p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you. The grid allows for batch updates, so I will be using the business list base. </p>
