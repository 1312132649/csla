<P>As the form is in Insert mode then by design it assumes that binding isn't necessary.&nbsp; Consider it from a different viewpoint -&nbsp;if you have an object&nbsp;that you have set&nbsp;defaults on&nbsp;then technically you have already created it and are now in the process of <EM>editing</EM> it.&nbsp; So with that in mind then I guess you want your form view to be in Edit mode <img src="/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue [:P]" /></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
