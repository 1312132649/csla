I have a collection as a data source to a .NET binding source.<br>The item objects in the collection have some smart date properties and some int, string properties.<br>The problem for me occurs when I am positioned in a cell bound to a smart date and then move from it to a cell that is bound to a string property, at this point StringToDate method on the SmartDate class is executing and throwing an exception if the string value is lets say "H" on that cell. I have noticed that the value that is being sent to the StringToDate for conversion is the value of the string property in my case the value of the cell I am moving at from the smart date cell. This does not happen if I am moving from a smart date cell to a integer cell or moving from a string cell to another string cell.<br>Also this does not happen with .NET grid view.<br><br>Anyone any idea?<br><br>Thanks a lot,<br>Burim Ratkoceri<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
