My site (lhotka.net) isn't set up for granular authorization, so this would require enhancements to the software there. The wiki (<A href="http://www.lhotka.net/wiki">www.lhotka.net/wiki</A>) is a fine place, though that FlexWiki software turned out to be harder to work with and manage than I'd hoped. Still, the wiki is there, and you can certainly set up such a page on the wiki.</P>
<P>At some point I'd like to swap out FlexWiki for some simpler wiki software like screwturn wiki. Not as powerful, but <EM>much</EM> easier to admin and work with. That'll happen sometime after I upgrade the forum software to a newer version of Community Server. The problem, of course, is that none of these things are fun, and so they fall to the bottom of the priority stack since the current stuff works adequately, if not spectacularly.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
