<P>Are there any examples of uses of authorization rules section to meet the needs of SOX compliance?</P>

Usually someone would have a checklist they went through making sure our systems met their standards. But most of it did not really make sense...</P>
<P>So maybe they are confusing you in this case. They should not audit CSLA or its authorization rules. They are a mechanism not an implementation (you could probably word this better)&nbsp;so really you should be providing extracts from your code such as what happens in your objects CanAdd(), CanDelete(), CanWriteProperty() etc...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>d3thm0nk3y replied on Friday, June 26, 2009</h2><P>Thanks for the info. I did some checking and I am not sure how serious to take some of these things. I am a bit confused on it. Silly government. But they are going through our source code. Asking questions.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, June 29, 2009</h2>Well without knowing what the SOX rules are, its hard to suggest anything.  Do you have some examples?  Like you need to audit?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
