The 'data-centric' class then exposes</FONT></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;<FONT size=3>"any retrieved data in a way that the business object can pull the data into itself, so it can load its private variables with the values." </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><FONT size=3>Is there any code floating</FONT> &nbsp;<FONT size=3>around out there that experiments with this implementation of CSLA .NET? If so, I'd be interested to have a look at it. </FONT></SPAN></P>

I believe this is discussed in detail in the book.</P>

Downloaded SubSonic and pre-ordered the book. It looks like the current e-book&nbsp;pre-order from Apress gets you the currently available first 21 chapters. Then the complete e-book is sent when it becomes available. I think the hard-copy is a seperate pre-order issue.</P>
