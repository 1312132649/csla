You should be able to use the existing remoting or web service proxy as a base for doing so, and CSLA is designed to allow you to plug in your own channel proxy on the client - see Chapter 4 for details.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Rayk replied on Monday, August 21, 2006</h2>Okay, I can definitely see how to use the Web Service proxy as a base.&nbsp; Seems like the GetPortal() method will just add the 2 lines I need to set up the proxy server info:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wsvc.Proxy = WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wsvc.Proxy.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultNetworkCredentials;<br>&nbsp;<br><br>I can't figure out where to put the remoting info, but I'm not sure I need to figure it out if the web service method works.&nbsp; Seems like the HttpChannel iDictionary has a spot for Credentials, but I'm not sure how to get the ICredentials interface in there, let alone created and set to the default values.&nbsp; <br><br>I'll test the web service methods first.<br><br>Thanks, <br>-RayK<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
