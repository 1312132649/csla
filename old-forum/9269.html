<p>I cannot seem to find a normal property snippet where get/set are public (e.g. Name property in Project in the PTracker sample). Am I missing something? Closes I could find was the &quot;Define a readonly Csla property&quot; snippet and then manually deleting the private keyword in the setter. </p>
<p>Also, the &quot;Insert Data Access region&quot; snippet does not appear to be adding a DataPortal.Create method. Was that intentional?</p>
<p>I know I can modify the snippets but would have thought these should already be there :-)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 26, 2010</h2><p>The &quot;cslaprop&quot; snippet is a standard read-write property - I use it all the time. I&#39;m not sure what it is called in terms of a file name - but the keyboard shortcut is &quot;cslaprop&quot;.</p>
<p>The DataPortal_Create() method is intentionally not in the data access snippet, because it is now rare to override/overload that method. The base class includes a standard implementation that works for most common scenarios.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Killian35 replied on Monday, July 26, 2010</h2><p>The problem with the C# clsaprop snippet is that it is declared as &quot;vb&quot; instead of &nbsp;&quot;CSharp&quot; and also has the VB comments. So VS isn&#39;t including that cslaprop snippet.</p>

<p>In fact, I think that snuck in there very late - so if you go back to RC0 or Beta 3 you should get the right version. I was updating the VB snippets late in the process, and must have somehow hit ctl-S when I shouldn&#39;t have...</p>
<p>I&#39;ll add this to the bug list to get fixed in 4.0.1.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
