<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with the display format of the smartdate within a devexpress grid.</p>
<p>Please look at the attachedment, and within the archive there is a screendump folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you will not is I have a normal datatable with a normal datetime column. &nbsp;it display the date correctly within the grid. &nbsp;when you click within the date column it still keeps the correct date format of dd/mm/yyyy (that is my regional settings)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another datatable with a smart date column (instead of datetime) &nbsp;and what you will note is when the data is displayed in the grid, it displayed correctly as dd/mm/yyyy. &nbsp;but when you click within the date column it swap the dd and mm around and then try to do a parse of that date. &nbsp;if the day &gt; 12 then it becomes the month and it cannot parse that date and it will clear the active editors text. &nbsp;if the day is &lt;= 12 it will swap the dd and mm around in the active editors text.</p>
<p>Now this behaviour does not happen with normal datetime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I&#39;am not 100% sure where the problem is, but i tend to think it is within the smartdate class..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>If you are exposing a SmartDate directly as the property type, then what are you hoping to gain that you don&#39;t get from DateTime itself?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
