This means I update ProjectTracker when I write the books, and that happens after the framework is stable.</p>
<p>In other words, ProjectTracker is usually not a great sample for CSLA until after the book comes out.</p>
<p>I am currently working on the book, and so ProjectTracker is not stable or finished, and won&#39;t be for several weeks.</p>
<p>I am also considering creating a different sample, and dropping ProjectTracker entirely. I don&#39;t know if I will do that for sure, but I must confess that after a decade of ProjectTracker I find it quite boring :)</p>
<p>There are several other sample applications that demonstrate WPF. Perhaps the best is the SimpleNTier sample in Samples\Net\cs</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sorrapob replied on Tuesday, October 19, 2010</h2><p>Hi Rocky,</p>
