The same can be achieved using composition (although this is merely a structural pattern than a behavioral one, however you could 'compose' behaviors) or using commands where you put every bit of logic that you would like to reuse in a separate command that can be used by any object interested (resembles strategy pattern, only reuse is the driving force instead of variation).<br><br>Bayu<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>PStanev replied on Tuesday, March 20, 2007</h2>Using interfaces is taking more code to achive inheritance.

Objects in need of the behavior you factored out this way can plug-in whatever they need following composition, strategy or command handler patterns<br><br>Bayu<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Tuesday, March 20, 2007</h2><P>The better way, and my suggestion, is to use collaboration to achieve the code reuse you are after.&nbsp; For instance, and as shown in Rocky's implementation, when designing a class that implements ICloneable, instead of rewriting the same block of code, delegate to another class for the work (ObjectCloner).&nbsp; This can be done in many cases to give you the benefits of code reuse but, alas, not all.&nbsp; In these cases there are many other suggested approaches, as outlined in the other posts, that may help you achieve your goal.&nbsp; You will find that no one pattern fits across all cases, it is finding the right mix that will get you the farthest.</P>
