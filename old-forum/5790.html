<P>I have set up a many-to-many database relationship that needs to be edited a DataGridView in the User interface.&nbsp; The table has two columns: ID1 and ID2, where both are foreign keys, and together they form the primary key for the table.&nbsp; The CSLA linking seems to work for Insert.&nbsp; So, my save button will succeed in calling CSLADataSource_InsertObject.&nbsp; However, if I update a row, and hit save, the update method never gets called.&nbsp; This works for my other forms.&nbsp; </P>
<P>My guess is that it related to the DataKey for the grid, but I am unaware of how to fix the problem.&nbsp; We are actually using an Infragistics grid, but we've also tried this with Microsoft's DataGridView.&nbsp; For Infragistics, I tried setting the DataKeyField as follows:</P>
<P>.DataKeyField = "ID1, ID2";&nbsp;</P>
<P>with no success.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Any help is appreciated,</P>
