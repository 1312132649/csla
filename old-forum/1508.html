You can register to a channel without actually registering to an object, and thus listen to events from objects that you don't know exist.<br>All events and registrations are buffered if you use remoting, and refired when the object returns from the dataportal.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, October 17, 2006</h2>Ok, so it just makes things nicer using the observer pattern.&nbsp; Sounds cool.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
