What I currently want to happen is the user clicks a find button, a new tab is created, and a find screen appears inside it. Using the find screen the user can select clients and these then open in their own new tabs allowing the user to edit them. So if the user went in and selected three clients, the screen would have four tabs, one for the find screen and three client tabs.</p>
<p>My problem is that I&#39;m not sure how to set this up in my program. I&#39;ve created a TabControl and bound the ItemsSource to a collection of viewmodels (that I can add to whenever a user adds a new screen). I can use a DataTemplateSelector to select the DataTemplate that contains the right view, but I don&#39;t know how to set the resource of the view to my viewmodel.</p>
<p>I&#39;m doing this in WPF and I&#39;m using Bxf to do this, and this normally works &nbsp;but I&#39;m unsure how it fits in with the TabControl.</p>
<p>Has anyone done something similar to this before (preferably using Bxf)?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
