Since i showed the&nbsp;Silverlight &amp; Moonlight power to&nbsp;my 'superiors' we turned that way, i learned alot about silverlight in the past days and i'm all positive.</P>
<P>Even in windows i like the ASync thinking so much better for the user experience, no hanging screens etc. But people see a risk in that, that it might be unsafe and Sync calls are just easier. Also easier debugging, i didn't see enough reasons to even bother convincing people. Now Silverlight "demands" it i already love Silverlight ;)</P>

For example, if I have a name value list that fetches and the result comes back after my datacontext has been set, it doesn't reflect my selection for the bound property. (There are workarounds &amp; such).<br /><br />Overall it's a model I've gotten more comfortable with too - code cleanliness and readability can be kept up IMO by handling asynch in manners like this: <br /><br />IndividualLookup.Exists(15, delegate (object sender, DataPortalResult e) { -- handle result here -- });<br /><br />And it's easy to actually nest this sort of behavior too when needed. <br /><br />I think given the choice between WPF and Silverlight, the tooling maturity makes it a legitimate debate to me depending on the application, but between ASP.Net and Silverlight when it's not "customer-customer" facing it's hard for me to see a case where I'd want to use ASP.Net in the scenarios I run across. I feel so incredibly more productive w/ Silverlight.<br /><br />So sad, my JavaScript skills are wasting away :)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
