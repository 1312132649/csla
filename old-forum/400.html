to be on the form for some quirky databinding scenarios.&nbsp; I have done
this, and I have set the ReadValuesOnChange even to true in teh binding
sources.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
However....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this still doesn't work with the datetime picker -&nbsp; The
date loads up ok, but the datetimepicker control, when I select a new
date, won't update the datasource.<br>
<br>
I've tried to find out what my problem is using the book but I still
can't find it.. Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>brettswift replied on Monday, June 19, 2006</h2>Anyone? <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JWoods replied on Monday, June 19, 2006</h2><P>I also tried BindingSourceRefresh on a form with a datagridview where the last row that I updated was not being refreshed.&nbsp; This did not solve the problem&nbsp; The problem was solved by a call to BindingSource.ResetBindings(false).</P>

<P>Perhaps I misunderstood your problem, which is the opposite, where you are changing the data through the control but your datasource is not updated.</P>

I resorted to using the ValueChanged datetimepicker event to update my object manually.<br><br>Dean.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
