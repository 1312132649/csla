<p>Says ModelClientValidationRule is defined in two assemblies.</p>
<p>Found fix via http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7510484/modelclientvalidationrule-conflict</p>
<p>Essentially right mouse click the project, select &quot;Add Deployable Dependencies&quot; and pick MVC.&nbsp; It adds a _bin_deployableAssemblies folder to the project with the required dll&#39;s and then compiles ok.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="comment-copy">Update: though now I see that the project loads the home page but none of the links that load business objects work so perhaps this was not the solution or it&#39;s just not compatible with vs2012 and mvc4.<br /></span></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
