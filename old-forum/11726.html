<p>Is there a compatible version and I&#39;m just doing something wrong or is that yet to come?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, November 27, 2012</h2><p>Andy had posted a question about Monodroid/touch earlier and I&#39;m interested to hear the response not just with your question but his as well.</p>
<p>I saw Rocky spoke in MN a few months back and my impression was that he wasn&#39;t particularly invested in Monodroid/touch mostly in terms of certain things not quite working well in relation to CSLA.&nbsp; (for some reason static members come to mind).</p>
<p>We&#39;re reaching a more mature state with our SL app and have a good customer base and clearly one of the things that starts cropping up is iPAD (by far more than Android which is really a non-issue for our LOB app).</p>
<p>I am probably more apt to mess around with WinRT prototyping than MonoTouch but it&#39;s always been on my list of things to investigate.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the aspect I worry most with MonoDroid/MonoTouch is not so much CSLA&#39;s/Rocky&#39;s commitment to keeping compatibility but rather Xamarin&#39;s long term prospects.&nbsp; I am totally uneducated on how well MonoDroid/MonoTouch is doing, but instinctively it doesn&#39;t seem like it would have a lot of adoption.</p>
<p>I&#39;m actually curious if anyone is actively doing commercial apps with CSLA &amp; MonoTouch together (or MonoDroid).&nbsp; I don&#39;t see a whole lot of board traffic around the subject so I&#39;m guessing there aren&#39;t-many-if-any.</p>
<p>Sorry for the slight thread-jack, I just thought I&#39;d mention Andy&#39;s earlier post regarding MonoTouch/MonoDroid and lump it into this one.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 27, 2012</h2><p>I do think we&#39;ll now be able to create a monodroid version of 4.5, because mono now does support async/await. They didn&#39;t until recently, so my roadmap didn&#39;t include supporting Android with 4.5.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have a timetable for Android support. The upcoming release is focused on fixing some bugs and supporting WP8.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Sunday, December 02, 2012</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>RockfordLhotka<br></b>

<p>So Monotouch is still an unknown, or should both mono/touch/droid be similar work (as its getting Mono and Csla to work together)?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, December 02, 2012</h2><p>Sadly MonoTouch is a known quantity. There are limitations on MonoTouch due to Apple&#39;s legal requirements for code running on iOS. Those limitations block certain features of C# that are used by CSLA.</p>
<p>Perhaps the mono team will figure out an alternative way to implement those features that don&#39;t violate Apple&#39;s legal requirements.</p>
<p>Or perhaps Apple will back off on their legal limitations (ha!).</p>
<p>Either way, until that is resolved, we can&#39;t port a compatible version of CSLA to iOS.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Saturday, December 08, 2012</h2><p>That&#39;s unfortunate.&nbsp; Is Monotouch still suitable for building apps on ios though?&nbsp; I could still develop my application, and if / when csla can be ported I could move to that.&nbsp;&nbsp; If possible I&#39;d like to build my Mono* apps, and then later when Csla is available on one or both I could do some modification to utilize it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#39;d really like to build apps for Android and iOS as easily as I&#39;d be able to build RT apps, and that means .Net&nbsp;/ C# :-)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, February 08, 2013</h2><p>Sorry to ressurrect a dead thread but ... in regards to <strong>MonoTouch:</strong></p>
<p>One thing that wasn&#39;t clear to me was if CSLA 4.3 worked and it was just CSLA 4.5 that didn&#39;t work.&nbsp; My guess is that neither really work, but that&#39;s the first question.</p>
<p>The second question is - what are the &quot;certain features of C# that are used by CSLA&quot; in regards to the limitations (I remember you saying it revolves around JITing)?&nbsp; I&#39;m just curious how extensive the problem is.&nbsp; It <em>sounds like</em> they&#39;re pervasive to where CSLA is just not really ever going to work with MonoTouch, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a fair statement or an unfair statement.</p>
<p>It definitely sounds like only a few people have tried and ran into the issues, so I imagine there isn&#39;t enough demand to really make it a priority, but it&#39;s not entirely clear where things do sit - as the CSLA page talks about MonoTouch / MonoDroid support and it sounds like MonoTouch is a &quot;no&quot; and MonoDroid is a &quot;if you use 4.3 or earlier&quot;.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you speak in Vegas.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, February 08, 2013</h2><p>I expect to resume support for Android, but that&#39;ll have to wait until Kevin (or someone) has time to do the work/testing necessary.</p>
<p>The monotouch issue has to do with interfaces that return generic types. It has been a while and I don&#39;t remember the gory details, but basically those types aren&#39;t known at compile time, and rely on the JIT compiler to resolve the type at runtime. Because Apple has a legal prohibition against JIT and any dynamic behavior at runtime this is blocked.</p>
<p>The first place you encounter it is with RegisterProperty, because it is interface-based and returns a generic type. I&#39;m sure there are other places too, but that was the first hit :)</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
