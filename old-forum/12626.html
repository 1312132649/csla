<p>That depends quite a bit on which version of CSLA you are using and how the app i configured (like using GZIP or other compression utilities to compress the packages or https encrypted communication). </p>
<p>In general terms a CSLA powered Silverlight client will use XML (generated by a CSLA implemented serializer)&nbsp; to communicate with the server. And yes - they ae not that easily readable for &quot;human eyes&quot;.</p>
<p>So the standard fiddler debugging proxy should be able to catch the xml in clear text. And no - there is no CSLA specific fiddler inspector available - nor should there be any need for this. </p>
<p>You can use any Decompiler (like ILSpy, dotPeek, JustDecompile - all available for free) to inspect the actual source code for both SL and .NET code in C#.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jamessneg replied on Tuesday, May 13, 2014</h2><p>Hi Jonny,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;The app uses CLSA&nbsp;<span>4.5.500.0 and it does to appear to be using some sort of compression(this is what I need to find out but don&#39;t know where to look). &nbsp;I should have clarified in my original post that, yes, I can see the XML of the Soap request in Fiddler, but I need to deserialize the contents of the base64 encoded data in those XML fields(e.g. the ObjectData field). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am currently going down the track of decompiling the SL code as I do have access to that (as you mentioned). &nbsp;However, I don&#39;t have access to the server-side .NET code as this is a black-box test. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My end goal is to be able to manually tamper with requests so I can test how the server responds to unexpected input values, hence why I&#39;m hoping to be able to write a Fiddler inspector.</span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jamessneg replied on Tuesday, May 13, 2014</h2><p>Thought I&#39;d post <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/12335/56778.aspx">this link</a> as well for reference as he had the same question as well. &nbsp;I&#39;ll investigate his replies more tomorrow.</p>
