<P>I tried to set up a new common rule where the &lt;T&gt; had to be a SmartDate.</P>
<P>The compiler refused.&nbsp; Basically, it wouldn't take a struct.&nbsp; It suggested an Interface.</P>
<P>But, the methods that I wanted were either the constructors or the static parse routines, neither of which are allowed in Interfaces.&nbsp; :(</P>
<P>Any clues?</P>

<P>I've greatly simplified my example just to find a way past the compiler rules...</P>
<P>The actual rule we are coding is a common rule to handle Min-Max situations, such as StartDate must not be after EndDate.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The public properties that have values will be strings, but the corresponding&nbsp;private variables will be SmartDates, SmartInt16s, SmartFloats, Int32, Decimal, DateTime, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; That means the input property values must be converted to the appropriate data type.&nbsp; I was trying to write several different, relatively simple versions of the MinMax rule, each one keyed to a specific datatype, hoping that the compiler would be able to figure out which one to call.</P>
<P>I think I'll just have to add a parameter to the rule, which willl be called&nbsp;ComparisonDatatype, and write the appropriate if statements. :(</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>William replied on Tuesday, May 01, 2007</h2>The "where" clause implements to constraint "is a" relationship (i.e. inheritance).
