Perhaps all you want is the listening bs to refresh all data, but not necesarily re-run all your validation methods because that could be expensive in some scenarios. If that is what you need, why not a combo of ValidationRules.CheckRules() &amp; PropertyHasChanged("")? (I know I'm stating the obvious).<br><br>Andrés<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, December 11, 2006</h2>There's a method in BusinessBase you should call to indicate that an unknown property (or all properties) has changed. I don't have time to look up that method name right now, but that method does raise PropertyChanged with no property name specified, causing the property data binding behavior. It <EM>does not</EM> interact with the validation rules subsystem at all - so you'd also need to call ValidationRules.CheckRules() to take care of that.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Monday, December 11, 2006</h2>Isn't it OnUnknownPropertyChanged?<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, December 11, 2006</h2>Fair enough.&nbsp; It just seemed to me that PropertyHasChanged( "" ) would do the same thing and also run the rules.&nbsp; But if PropertyHasChanged shouldn't be called with "" or null, maybe it should raise an exception if it gets one of those as parameter values?<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
