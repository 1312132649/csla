<P>It would be impossible to make every body agrees on one naming convention so I suggest to leave as it is and let user&nbsp;change their personal copy when they don't like the naming convention.</P>
<P>However, customizing the template should be easy as every thing that can be customized are in the Constant Region of TemplateBase.cs</P>

I actually have started on a storeprocedure.cst file that uses templetebase.vb. When I complete it I will also add it to the templetebase.cs as well if you would like. I was going to do the formatting in the const section as well se that people can add there own comment blocks, etc...<br><br>JT<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
