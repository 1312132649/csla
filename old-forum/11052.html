I am curious if other people have sought to bind to these in order to add functionality to Windows Forms for instance if the object goes from IsNew = true to false then enable other parts of the form which allow child features...</p>
<p>Also there are no specific events raised for these properties. I think it would be useful to add events specific to these properties and also pass the old and new value if it is not simply a boolean, rather say an enum...</p>

<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, January 13, 2012</h2><p>Hi, </p>
<p>We plan to add events to these properties for CSLA 4.5 (and at the same time terminate support for Windows Forms).</p>
<p>Windows DataBinding is not suitable for having events on the &quot;status&quot; properties due to how OnPropertyChanged is handled in the UI (ie: all properties but the one that has changed is reread per OnPropertyChanged). Imagine the impact with 5-6 status properties and reread of all properties (including child properties with nested BindingSources) x times per time a &lt;bo&gt; property has changed.</p>
<p>We rather recommend to use ReadWriteAuthorization or create your own components or implement this in BindingSource.CurrentItemChanged for Windows Forms development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Xaml (WPF/SL) we recommend to use the Csla.Xaml.ViewModel as baseclass for viewmodels that exposes status properties with events for databinding.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, January 13, 2012</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>JonnyBee<br></b>

<p>&quot;Terminate&quot; is such a strong word :)</p>
<p>I think what will happen is that we&#39;ll still support WinForms, but it might be less optimal for data binding, because we&#39;ll be raising property changed events as necessary for WPF/WinRT.</p>
<p>So WinForms will still work, but forms with hundreds of data bound controls may perform less well.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Des Nolan replied on Sunday, January 15, 2012</h2><p>Dear JonnyBee,</p>
<p>I understand you desire to support newer UIs, and I&#39;m see Rocky clarified your comment, as his positions as I understand it, is currently that while no enhancements will be forthcoming for WinForms, backwards compatibility will be maintained for the time being (or while such is possible). </p>
<p>So, I encourage you think a little more about your position and see if there isn&#39;t a creative way to not impacting perfomance for WinForm which, I believe a lot of Line of Business Developers (LOBDs) out there are still actively using, and will probably keep doing so until Windows 9, when it is obvious what Microsoft&#39;s best position is for a future UI. I accept WPF and Silverlight have wonderful new &#39;pretty&#39; features (haven&#39;t looked at WinRT) and may make WinForms look dated, but they really don&#39;t offer anything that&#39;s a real need for LOBD&#39;s who operate to tight schedules, which typically doesn&#39;t permit learning a new more difficult to use UI just to make things pretty.</p>
<p>Maybe you could add a switch that allows those extra events to be turned off for the rest of us still working with WinForms. </p>
<p>I won&#39;t be moving my 500+ WinForms CSLA application to another UI until its obvious which Microsoft one is going to be the lead candidate for the next few years. I didn&#39;t jump to WPF and Silverlight partially because of their learning curve and lack of compelling must have features, but more because I did not see Microsoft adopt those UIs for their mainstream applications. I&#39;m now waiting to see when they are willing to start adopting one of their own new UIs for their business applications going forward. That&#39;s when I feel I will need to make the move to a new UI.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, and let me conclude by saying I love CSLA.</p>

Time will tell - we&#39;re not yet actively working on 4.5, so it is premature to say what will happen exactly.</p>
<p>I fully appreciate that people will continue to run WinForms apps on Windows 8, and maybe even Windows 9. Fortunately Microsoft isn&#39;t doing much (if anything) to WinForms beyond keeping it running. I&#39;m already pretty confident that CSLA 4.3 will work on Win8 on the Desktop side - where WinForms lives.</p>
<p>Whether we can continue to support increasingly disparate platforms (WinForms vs WinRT/Metro) in a single code base is debatable. Eventually we&#39;ll hit a show stopping issue. The collection differences between WinForms and WPF are a near-show stopper, and the solution isn&#39;t ideal. I&#39;m sure that sort of thing will only get worse - and at some point I&#39;ll decide it is too painful to make sense to support both.</p>
<p>At that point, WinForms will be pinned to some version of CSLA, and subsequent versions won&#39;t support WinForms.</p>
<p>It is hard to see an alternative, when WinForms is unchanging and the rest of the dev platform is evolving. Frankly I&#39;m a little surprised that we&#39;ve been able to accomodate the delta as well as we have given 6+ years of this platform deviation.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
