<P>Does anyone know how to order the fields in the DetailsView at runtime?&nbsp; I looked at the rows collection and it doesn't have any method like Move().&nbsp; I am autogenerating the rows at runtime and I need a way to order the fields.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the CslaDatasource orders the fields on the BusinessBase object.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

It uses reflection to scan your busness object type and find all its properties. It does no specific ordering of those properties - the order is really set by the .NET runtime and how reflection returns them. You can never count on any data source to provide proper ordering of columns/fields - it is the job of the UI to control presentation.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pvanroos replied on Wednesday, August 23, 2006</h2><P>Hi Rocky,</P>
