<P>When I drag it onto a winform, it creates a datagrid, but even though I have enabled Adding, Editing, and Deleting. </P>
<P>I then go to my DataBindingSource and turn on AllowNew, which shows the new row.</P>
<P>But when I try to add a new row in runtime, it complains that there is no constructor for my class, b/c it uses&nbsp;a factory.</P>
<P>How can I get this to work?</P>
<P>I am up against a deadline here.&nbsp; Please help!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
