<p>I am using the MVVM design pattern in Silverlight. I got a datagrid that display Users with one column displaying roles as a combobox. The user of the application can link a Role to a User by selecting a role from the combobox inside the datagrid.</p>
<p>The datagrid is basically bound to the ViewModel, but my combobox is bound to a CslaDataProvider. The add new and Save works as expected but the cancel is not working to expectation. For instance when I edit an existing user and select a different role and then click the cancel button the cancel doesn&#39;t happen.</p>
<p>Is this beacause of the CslaProvider or is the cancel function not working correctly with datagrids in Silverlight?</p>
<p>Has anyone else had problems with cancel using Datagrids in Silverlight using MVVM?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, November 11, 2010</h2><p>The data provider model isn&#39;t a particularly great tool for implementing MVVM. In fact, since Microsoft has pretty much stopped focusing on the data provider concept, I view it as a legacy technology and only left it in CSLA 4 for backward compatibility.</p>
<p>I suggest using the ViewModelBase or ViewModel classes. They are designed to support MVVM as discussed in the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/">CSLA 4 MVVM video series</a>, and are generally easier and more powerful than the data provider model.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
