<P>When I go to the code portion of the page I can use [csladatasourcename].SelectObject without getting any errors so obviously the csladatasource element is being recognized in the code behind page.</P>
<P>It's bizzare because if I click on the datasource control in the designer the property window has the properties available for it: TypeAssemblyName and TypeName.&nbsp; I can build the solution and view it in the ASP web server environment with no errors.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Monday, August 21, 2006</h2><P>Now I'm wondering if it is because I'm running in the ASP virtual web server instead of IIS.&nbsp; I've no use for the CSLA security objects so I thought I'd be okay in the virtual environment.&nbsp; Does that sound plausible?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 21, 2006</h2>That shouldn't matter - you should be able to run in either environment.<br><br>However, the intellisense in the html/xml editors of VS drive off a set of schema files. My guess is that any custom controls would have this issue, because obviously those tags don't exist in the schema files and so wouldn't be recognized as "valid" elements.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Monday, August 21, 2006</h2><P>The CSLA datasource shows up in the tool box - when I drag and drop it onto my form the CSLA.dll is added to the web sites bin directory.&nbsp; The error message says the following: </P>
