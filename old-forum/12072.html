<p>&nbsp; We set up a website using different servers for application server and web server. If we want to transfer file from app server to web server, how will CSLA.NET BLL/DAL&#39;s implementation be? Is there any example?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Monday, July 15, 2013</h2><p>What do you mean by transfer a file? We have a couple of places where our business objects (commands usually, but we also have read-only lists of &quot;image infos&quot; which contain image files essentially) - and we just use a byte[] managed property.&nbsp; Is that what you&#39;re referring to?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>fredg replied on Tuesday, July 16, 2013</h2><p>Thanks. How and where should we increase the size limitation of the file stream if its a large file?</p>

<p>If it is an image, there is a mechanism to get a &quot;clipping&quot; sort of image of a particular dimension on the server side thus effectively getting a pretty small byte stream for an image (we need a smaller version of an image for a &quot;preview&quot; in the lower right of our edit forms and only get the full image when we need it.</p>
<p>You can obviously benefit from using compression here - either via the wcf portal if you&#39;re using that or just hitting the byte[] with compression/decompression.</p>
<p>Generally though if you&#39;re getting a file you&#39;re getting a file and I don&#39;t really think a big byte[] as a managed property is going to be that fundamentally different than getting the big file in some other sort of manner (except with certain CSLA&nbsp;configurations you&#39;ll just get compression automatically applied to it).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
