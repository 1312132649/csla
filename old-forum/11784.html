<p>Thanks for your answer. </p>
<p>Yes, I already know how to create an attribute that inherit from ValidationAttribute and is recognized by CSLA. </p>
<p>My question is about how to make that attribute in a way that is recognized by MVC to generate the HTML needed for the unobtrusive validation to work, without having to reference System.Web.MVC in my class library.</p>
<p>If I follow the tutorial I would have to implement IClientValidatable and then if I try to apply my attribute to a property, I will need to reference System.Web.MVC in my class library. At least that is what I understood.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 14, 2013</h2>This sounds like a question you might need to ask in an ASP.NET forum on MSDN or something.

I&#39;ve never explored this part of the DataAnnotations infrastructure.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
