<p>I am sorry for any inconvenience. I did respond to your email about 12 hours ago, hopefully that resolved your issue.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, June 15, 2013</h2><p>I just looked at the email log. It appears that your .com address isn&#39;t valid - gmail bounces all emails to that address instantly saying that the server doesn&#39;t exist.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
