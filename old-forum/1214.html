Hi Andy,<br>
I was wondering how far did you come with your "UI view route"?<br>As for myself, I've used another approach with child objects having Selected property, but I see the point in Rocky's "avoid the UI artifact" suggestion.<br><br>Miroslav</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, September 20, 2006</h2>I haven't gotten to work on this&nbsp; yet; got sidetracked into other featuers.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
