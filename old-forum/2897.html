User can change only 1 property or all 50 of them at once.<br>So, what would be a&nbsp; performance result if instead of creating stored procedure that include all 50 columns to update(in this case only 1 column was actually changed), I would generate on-fly SQL query that could contains only 1 column to update.<br><br>2. I can create a few tables : EmployeeInfo, EmployeeAddress,EmployeePayHistory and so on (instead of one big table) then based on what property was changed I would run a stored procedure related to that property. I don't know yet how difficult it would be to define procedure based on Property name changed .<br><br>Thanks,<br><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Thursday, May 17, 2007</h2><P>The performance gains would be so minimal compared to all the work of building and maintaining such a structure, I doubt it would be worth it.&nbsp; Perhaps in cases where you have a number of huge text/Varchar(Max) columns that you are updating it might be warranted, but even then, I am doubtful.&nbsp; Using dynamic sql would also negate(or make worse)&nbsp;any performance gains.</P>
