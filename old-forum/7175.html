Anyway it isn't open source it seems? Maybe the source can be bought.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 26, 2009</h2><P>The trick with the ribbon is that Microsoft owns some patents or other IP around it. So anyone creating a ribbon-like control must pay a royalty to Microsoft. If an open source project did this, I'd assume the authors of the software would have to pay those royalties out of their own pockets or something.</P>
<P>In short, if you get a ribbon control for free, you are probably in danger of being sued.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Friday, June 26, 2009</h2>http://msdn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/office/aa973809(en-us).aspx<br /><br /><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>Microsoft:</strong></div><div>4.

I could potentially see that as an issue with some OSS developers.  Sure, the license is free, but I always thought part of MS's reason for doing this was to get a feel for how widely the Ribbon metaphor was being used.  Being tracked by "The Man" wouldn't necessarily sit well with some folks... :-)<br /><br />- Scott</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, June 29, 2009</h2>Well, the odd thing is that I bought a ribbon control from Infragistics, and <b>I</b> needed to agree to the license as well.  So I don't know if it's the ribbon developers that need worry or ribbon USERS (i.e., developers putting ribbons in their app) that need to worry.<br /><br />As typical from MS, their licensing is exteremly confusing.  </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Monday, June 29, 2009</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>That's what I'm talking about.&nbsp; We have the Infragistics controls here at work, and the whole "Ribbon UI License" is why their install has a separate step regarding those controls.&nbsp; If you read through the text, it&nbsp;does say&nbsp;that you'll have to visit Microsoft's site if you want to use them.</FONT></P>

<P>It worked.</P>
<P>I was looking for the compatibilty button to click near the address bar and it was not appearing for the forum. (It is there for&nbsp;many other websites.) So I used Tools, Compatibilty View Settings and added lhotka.net and now it is OK.</P>
