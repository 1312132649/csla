<P>Be aware however, that switchable objects nearly always indicate a flawed object model. A model that is data-centric instead of responsibility-driven. </P>
<P>So while CSLA supports the concept, I do so grudgingly and because quite a few people use CSLA to create data-centric objects and I want to make them happy. But if you do good behavioral design you probably won't ever create a switchable object.</P>
<P>One bit of good news for people who do build switchable objects, is that the child data portal concept added in version 3.5 really simplifies the creation of switchable objects.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
