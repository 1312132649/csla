Check the web UI chapter (10?).</P>
<P>It was created <EM>specifically</EM> to support the two-way data binding in Web Forms, though it is also useful when creating XML services.</P>
<P>If you look at PTWeb, you'll see that the CslaDataSource raises events for insert and update. These are triggered when the user clicks the inert/update links in a DetailsView or similar control.</P>
<P>In that case, Web Forms data binding takes the values from the UI control and puts them into a Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; and you get the dictionary. You must then copy the values from the dictionary into your object's properties. You can do that by hand - one line of code per property, or you can use DataMapper. Either way works.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
