Our latest project was based on 2.11. The 2.11 program will log users in and we can get the roles by using my.user.isinrole("blah blah") just like we did in the 1.53 days. In 2.11 the current principal will be a csla style principal at this point. If we then reference a form from the older 1.53 program and do a showdialog, all is fine until we close that form. Then the current principal is not csla based, it has changed to the normal windows/kerberos one. So obviously all our roles are now gone. Is there any way to intermingle the two versions of csla? Any help would be appreciate. Thanks.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
