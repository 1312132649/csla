I'm wondering if you plan to add it later and make the deletion process similar to the previous frameworks. <br><br>Also how does the deletion of an object works in this new Framework?<br><br>Thanks in advance<br>Steven Walker<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lawrencek replied on Tuesday, February 19, 2008</h2><P>This may be an oversight on my part.&nbsp; I'll have look into that.<BR>&nbsp; <BR>I guess some history would help explain this, and I need to start building up some documentation. <BR>This version came about mainly because I had a data logging project in an industrial environment and the computer running the machine was running windows CE 5.0.&nbsp; I had been using CSLA for other business apps and I prefer it to datasets or something really boring like DTO's.&nbsp; So I set out find out if CSLA could be modified to run on CE.&nbsp; After looking at some other threads in this forum I decided to have a go at it.&nbsp; The result is a version really stripped down to just what I needed (which unfortunately did not include delete) for that project.&nbsp; I then realized afterwards that it would be good to try and add back as much as possible.&nbsp; This is the version that has been put up on the site and I am currently working on.<BR><BR>What's missing today?<BR>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; N-Level undo.<BR>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remote Data Portal.<BR><BR>What is different?<BR>1.&nbsp; CE does not have a Windows Principal so the only option is to roll your own.<BR>2.&nbsp; CE cannot create an instance of an object with private constructor so you must make it public if you want to use the DataPortal.xxx methods.<BR><BR>This not necessarily a complete list, it is an off the top of my head list.<BR>Keith<BR></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
