<P>This would allow derived classes to have a managed property and have a little more control over whether undo is supported for the property. </P>
<P>I could see a similar need for serializability also.</P>
<P>Basically, I'm looking for the equivalent of [NotUndoable] (and [Nonserialized]) for managed fields. </P>
<P>My apologies if I overlooked the&nbsp;ability to do this. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
