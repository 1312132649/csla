<P>Yes.</P>
<P>Local is faster.</P>
<P>Remote is more secure but slower. For example you could have a web server in the DMZ which is open to the Internet. It should be forbidden to access a database on the inside of the Corporate firewall. So it will use the remote dataportal to talk to another web server inside the firewall and that web server will contact the database. This way if the web server in the DMZ is hacked they can't get to the database.</P>
