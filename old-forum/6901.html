I believe I have the right CSLA references as the project builds. I keep getting invalid user. I am using Admin/admin. My trace file can be found here: http://www.spilmansoftware.com/traces.zip .<br /><br />I have not worked with Silverlight or much of WCF so I am not sure how to debug this project. <br /><br />I am running Windows 7 so I don't know if I am shooting myself in the foot because of the OS. Anyone else get Rolodex to run on Windows 7?<br /><br />I appreciate the help and direction.<br />Stan<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
