<p>I&#39;m trying to implement client side validation in an MVC application and I was wondering if there is an easy way to do that? I saw a lot of forum posts about this topic, but they were all old so I decided to post a new one to see the latest news <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>
<p>Have a great day!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, February 23, 2012</h2><p>You still must base your rules on the </p>
<p>&lt;bo&gt;.BusinessRules.GetRulesDescriptions </p>
<p>and transform these descriptions into client side rules.</p>

<p>Data annotations are honored by (executed by) CSLA, so they run on the server, in Windows Forms, WPF - every platform, even Android.</p>
<p>Data annotations are also honored by MVC 3 and MVC 4. The built-in ones from Microsoft automatically cause javascript to be generated and sent to the browser to run the rules on the client. It is my understanding (though I&#39;ve never done this) that you can write javascript for your custom attributes too, and that javascript will be sent to the browser automatically.</p>
<p>This does require that you write the rule twice - once in .NET and once in javascript - but at least you have a framework for the rules.</p>
<p>If you go down this road, I would very much like to hear your experiences - especially in terms of any complexity (or ease) in creating the javascript rule implementations within the context required by data annotations and MVC.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jpmir replied on Tuesday, November 27, 2012</h2><p>FYI</p>
