<p>I may also have a situation coming up in which I need to pick between two different remote servers, that is, the same service but running on different machines.&nbsp; My brief look at the CSLA code suggests that there is a single WCF URL value for the application.&nbsp; That, iin turns, suggests that there is no way to use two different versions of the WcfProxy.</p>
<p>Is this correct?&nbsp; Any suggestions about how to have the application talk to more than one remote server?</p>
