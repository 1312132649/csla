<P>Also,&nbsp; I would like to use the SplitBase option in the templates so I my generated code is in a base class that gets inherited by a main object.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow me to put custom code in the main object and not worry about the custom code being overwritten if I make a change to the table and re-generate the base.</P>
<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</P>
