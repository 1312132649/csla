<P>private static bool StartDateGTEndDate&lt;T&gt;(T target, Csla.Validation.RuleArgs e) where T: Project</P>
<P>if this is an object specific rule, wouldn't it work just as well to write:</P>
<P>private static bool StartDateGTEndDate&lt;Project&gt;(Project target, Csla.Validation.RuleArgs e)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Otherwise stated, is there any advantage to his syntax if you know that type of object you are dealing with is a Project?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, February 05, 2009</h2><P>I don't know - does that actually compile and run?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, February 05, 2009</h2><P>The signature will compile but the target value will be useless in the method body.</P>
<P>When done the right way you can use target. and get intellisense to list the fields and properties for you.</P>
<P>With this "new" syntax the list does not appear and you lose all the benefits of doing it the right way - you no longer have access to the fields and properties of the target.</P>

<P>PS - I have this comment in my code:</P><FONT size=2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Run, no.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well, actually what it is doing is taking &lt;WhateverTextIPutInHere&gt; and treating it as &lt;T&gt;...so the previous comment is correct.&nbsp; You lose all intellisense and specific object typing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sorry for the stupid question.&nbsp; Should have investigated it further before posting.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
