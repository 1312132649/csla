The authourization logic seems quite granular and tedious (having to specify read,write, and execute specifically for groups).  Does anyone have any examples of doing this dynamically?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Wednesday, August 05, 2009</h2><P>It's only complex if you have complex requirements.&nbsp; If you have simple requirements, it's a snap.</P>

<P>Most properties of most apps are unrestricted - at least for read - and so require no code.</P>
<P>If you really do have super-granular authz requirements from your business users, then it is true that it can get complex - but that's true of any authz implementation with complex business requirements.</P>
<P>Can you clarify a bit as to why you expect this to become complex for you?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
