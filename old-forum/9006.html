<p>Originally I was using a BLB, which was just one of&nbsp;the million or so (forgive the exageration) other children of the great grand daddy root object.&nbsp; Things were working great. </p>
<p>But then I thought that is a lot of child objects the FieldManager is cycling through at Save time (I have more than one autocomplete list and no one knows how big each will ultimately get).&nbsp; Hence the bright idea - make each list an ERLB, and thus the problem - each items is added to the list allright but no Save to DB.</p>
<p>Going through this topic in the forum, I have already learnt one thing - I can&#39;t make these lists the children of the root object - they must stand on the own.&nbsp; So now the question - sorry for the long sob story.</p>
<p>Am I barking up the wrong list type here - would I be able to make an ERLB work with autocompletebox with a save only when user clicks Add; or is there some magic in the datagrid databinding that triggers the Save?&nbsp; Would I be better off going back to the BLB?</p>
