<P>1) I'm wondering if people use the Editable Root List class with Undo or in an application with other business objects that have Undo?<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>2) And can anyone confirm if this class has no real use in Web forms?<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I've some guys offshore doing a large application for me, which was originally started in CSLA 1.0 by me, and at that time all the business classes had a manual save\undo set of actions. By the time CSLA 2.x came out I was largely removed from the coding end of things, and only had time to skim over the documentation, and I made what&nbsp;appears to be a bad call. I recommended the developers use&nbsp;Editable Root List classes for simple lookup list tables, as they seemed to offer a major code reduction using&nbsp;a single class, and being editable via a data grid. But when they delivered those working classes, I was like why isn't the Undo button working. Boy did I feel foolish when they told me there was no Undo capability for those classes. So now I have an application where nearly all the business classes have Undo, and a dozen or more do not. <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Can I blame R for my stupidity...surely the addition of an undoable business class should have had a warning in six inch red letters...or am I still being stupid and these classes are capable of easily supporting Undo, how do people use these classes? <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>If anyone has both WinForms and WebForms going against the same application, do they avoid the use of such classes, so there classes can be used in both environments?<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Any answers, greatly appreciated!<o:p></o:p></P>

<P>P.S. Before anyone gets on my case for the R remark, we all know who really is responsible...and I'm busy now, re-reading all the documentation to avoid future stupid mistakes.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, April 13, 2008</h2><P>It is hard to see where ERLB would make sense in the web - though perhaps people have found it useful there?</P>
<P>It is <EM>designed</EM> to support in-place editing in a Windows Forms grid in such a way that when the user moves off a row the changes to that row are immediately committed. Or if the user deletes a row, it is immediately deleted, etc.</P>
<P>I created it in response to numerous requests for this sort of behavior some years ago, but it is most certainly targeted at a very specific scenario and using it outside that scenario isn't supported (by me anyway).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DesNolan replied on Sunday, April 13, 2008</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>Thanks for replying, I take your point about it been created for a special case\need!</P>
<P>Other than that little snafu, we've been doing create things with your framework and really love it. </P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
