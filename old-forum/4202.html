<P><FONT face=Arial>I need to export some data from the local database to the remote by way&nbsp;of&nbsp;using the Business&nbsp;Objects&nbsp;&nbsp;(from the local to the remote Dataportal).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Has anyone come across a similar requirement? I'd like any thoughts on this...</FONT></P>

<P>If you plan to Insert it to a different database you have to set IsNew=True.</P>
<P>If you can't set it directly, you can create a new kind of BO which reads the values from the original BO. When it is created, IsNew=True and then you fill in the values from the other BO.</P>
<P>You also need to add connection string information explicitly to the Fetch and Insert methds as you do not want to rely on some automatic mechanism which may point you to the wrong database.</P>
