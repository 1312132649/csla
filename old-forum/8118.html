Each appointment has 2 people involved, who both need the general person details as name, address, city, state, zip, phone, fax, email etc. It's usually not repeatable, so I really don't need the people in a separate table to reuse in another appointment. However, my question is, for normalizing the database, I can create a people table, and the main appointment table would have 2 FK id fields linking to the people table, and it's always going to be a 1 to 1, since I will never reuse the same person. By doing it this way, I have normalized the database, since I did not repeat general fields, however, the CSLA object to handle it, I have 2 ways<br><br>1)&nbsp; To have 1 class 'Appointment' and I will repeat all fields twice for each person, and pass in all fields to a stored procedure which will save the data into the correct tables and return the new PK id's for each table/record.<br><br>2) Have a class for person and include it twice into the appointment class as a single child class, once for each person, and then call it's own save before saving the appointment. The problem is that I would need a reference in the main table to all fields in the children person tables in order to do form binding ???<br><br>Another approach to the whole idea is to include all fields into the appointment table and repeat the fields again for each person needed (we may need a third one too). The database would not be normalized, however, the CSLA class would be like any regular class since it only deals with one table.<br><br><b>Think it over, and let me hear your suggestions. You may have a different and better approach. I may not be clear with my question, so please ask me.<br><br>Thanks</b><br></font></font></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
