But when an item within the list goes from clean to dirty there isn't an OnChildChanged event.<br /><br />I noticed that the IsDirty property is asking the FieldManager for his state.<br /><br />Am i overlooking an event like OnDirtyChanged, or could this be a wish on the csla issue list?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Monday, November 02, 2009</h2><P>bump</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, November 02, 2009</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>rfcdejong:</strong></div><div>[...]having a list as child in the business object it only does a childchange when the list self changed.

<P>That should not be true. If a child in the list changes that should cause a ChildChanged event to flow up through the object graph. I'm pretty sure this works correctly, as I have apps that rely on this behavior.</P>
<P>I do know there were a couple bugs around the ChildChanged event several versions back, but if you are running 3.7.x it should be working correctly.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Monday, November 02, 2009</h2>Strange, i'll dig into this since it has been a couple of weeks ago we had issues with it. Often people at my company tent to find workarounds instead of solving it correctly or on a more generic way.<br /><br />I'll let u know and if i find some time i create a test program.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
