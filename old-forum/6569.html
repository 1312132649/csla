<P>I have a form where I edit to different root objects. I would very much like to bind the&nbsp;action buttons to both providers.</P>
<P>Is this possible?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, March 06, 2009</h2><P>So the Save button saves both objects?</P>
<P>You'll need to have an intermediate control in your XAML that can be called by InvokeMethod, and that intermediate control will need to invoke the two data provider controls.</P>
<P>This intermediate control doesn't exist - you'll need to create it - but that's not terribly hard. My experience with both WPF and SL is that you need to create many little UI helper controls like this, so it isn't an uncommon thing, and is something worth learning to do.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
