A user only would only have rights to create details for section 1 and not section 2, and a section 2 user may not be able to edit info in section 1. <br /><br />Looking forward to others suggestions.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>whelzer replied on Thursday, March 19, 2009</h2>I've had a similar issue, we merely used a single object as thats what it is for us (eg an Option Trade).<br><br>Front office users enter the Trade,&nbsp; Back Office enrich it.&nbsp; <br><br>We override CanWriteProperty and have code (albeit fairly complex stuff) which determines whether individual properties can be written&nbsp; to.&nbsp; The UI stuff is taken of via ReadWriteAuthorisation control.<br><br>This works very well for us seeing as there are huge numbers of properties involved, including&nbsp; lots of validation.<br><br>Can provide more detail if required.<br><br>Paul <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
