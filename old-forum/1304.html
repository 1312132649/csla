The only real solution is what I do in BindableBase. Plus you also need to mark the NonSerializable delegate field with NotUndoable.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vbdotnetguy replied on Friday, September 22, 2006</h2>Thank you sooooooooo much...

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=926473920-22092006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>Now that I think about it further, you should probably mark 
_both_ delegate fields as NotUndoable. Neither one should be affected by n-level 
undo. I need to make this same change to the new Saved event in version 2.1 as 
well.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
