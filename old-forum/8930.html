<p>I downloaded the 3.8.3 version of CSLA.NET for Silverlight Framework and Tests.&nbsp; I unzipped them into a \CSLA383 directory.&nbsp; I double-clicked on the Unit Test solution and it started the conversion wizard.&nbsp; I told it to leave the .NET version at 3.5.&nbsp; After the conversion finished I tried doing a &quot;ReBuild&quot; but that failed ... there were something like 1000 errors.</p>
<p>Help!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>artsd replied on Thursday, May 13, 2010</h2><p>I just started learning CSLA too. Is there any reason you didn&#39;t go with v4 beta 1?</p>
<p>Regardless, the first thing I would check is the References folder of each project in the solution. Make sure there are none flagged with errors. If tere are problems with Csla references, be careful when re-adding to pick the Silverlight flavor for Silverlight projects and the .NET flavor for all other project types (I suppose you will get an error anyway if you pick an incompatible version).</p>
<p>After that, start with error #1. You are probably just suffering from a domino effect of errors so you really don&#39;t have 1000 problems to fix :-).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pintoj replied on Friday, May 14, 2010</h2><p>Since I&#39;m trying to work my way through Rocky&#39;s 2008 book which is based on the 3.6 version I didn&#39;t want to get confused by anything that might be different in version 4.&nbsp; I figured 3.8.3 is probably close enough to 3.6 that I wouldn&#39;t get too confused.&nbsp; I do eventually plan on moving to version 4 once I become familiar with 3.6/3.8.&nbsp; It obviously would have been easier if the version 4 update to the book was available but I&#39;m trying to do the best I can with what is in print.</p>
<p>I think the problem I am having has to do w/ the UnitTestFramework.&nbsp; I see that my VS2010 Ultimate has UnitTestFramework but it is for .NET 4.&nbsp; My guess is that I have to somehow get the version of it for .NET 3.5 loaded into my PC.&nbsp; Since I am a newbie with all of this (.NET and VS) this should be &quot;fun&quot;. :-)</p>
<p>The other option (which maybe someone can tell me if it works) is to start over w/ 3.8.3 and when it converts the solution file for the tests to let it update it to use .NET 4.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It would be nice if there was a &quot;quick start&quot; guide to getting all this up and running today that is pretty close to what is in the 2008 book.&nbsp; I know this is only&nbsp; temporary but I can&#39;t wait until everything (book and software) is &quot;in sync&quot;.</p>

And CSLA 3.8 uses nunit 2.4, not the Microsoft test framework. So make sure you are using the right tools or you&#39;ll never get the tests to work.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pintoj replied on Friday, May 14, 2010</h2><p>After I load nunit 2.4, are there configuration settings that have to be tweaked to get nunit working with CSLA?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, May 14, 2010</h2><p>If you put the CSLA code and samples in the correct relative paths (as described in the instruction PDF at the bottom of the download page at <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx</a>), then the unit tests should just work. If you use a different path you might need to update the database paths in the config file for the tests.</p>
<p>Of course you need to make sure nunit is set to test your version of .NET - but I think they default to 3.5 now which would be right.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
