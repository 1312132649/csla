<P>I have a Order object which has the option to be Active or Inactive. There are 2 ways how I would change the status of the order. 1) I would open the order and change it status to Active/Inactive. I can also change anything else and call the save function, which will call the update SP. 2) I would select an order in a list and click on change status, allowing to change it and save. Do I need to load the full Order object or can I create a new Object ChangeOrderStatus which will have a SP to change the status only or now it's not normalized because we have 2 places where we can change the order status.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>

<P>Its up to you if you want both objects to have the "responsibility" to change the status of a given order.&nbsp; I would tend to think that the "Change Status" responsibility be its own object like your second example.&nbsp; For this you can create your&nbsp;ChangeOrderStatus (inherits from CommandBase)&nbsp;&nbsp;that sets the status accordingly.&nbsp; Your CommandBase object will need the order pk value as a&nbsp;criteria.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>white911 replied on Monday, October 30, 2006</h2><P>I am working with VB.Net 2003 and CSLA 1.53 which does not have yet the command object.</P>
<P>However if I create a seperate class which handles updating the status, do I also include it in the main Order Object when we update a full order to use the new class to update the status?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Monday, October 30, 2006</h2>Um, take another look at 1.53.&nbsp; It does have CommandBase.&nbsp; Admittedly, I am looking at C#, but I cannot see Rocky not including it in the VB.NET version as well.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
