<p class="MsoNormal">I would also like to see “sticky” threads.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most other forums that I have visited have “sticky”
threads that always remain on top.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
thread topics include “FAQ” and “For Beginners” etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>These threads would remain closed.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Sticky” threads make it easier for users to
get answers to common questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>This
would be a huge benefit to this forum.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since
you answer many of the most common questions on your <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Articles">www.lhotka.net/Articles</a> <span>&nbsp;</span>site, you could provide links to those pages
in the FAQ sticky. <o:p></o:p></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
