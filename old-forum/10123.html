<p>The only real difference I know of is that my Oracle driver is x64 on the server and x32 on my box.&nbsp; However most of the DataPortal calls are working until a certain part of the application.</p>
<p>The error I am getting is a nullReferenceException at line 142 of </p>
<p>CSLA.Server.ChildDataPortal.Fetch(Type objectType, params object[] parameters)</p>
<p>The particular piece of logic has been in production for over a year.&nbsp; It is a large fetch of data in an ObjectFactory.&nbsp; The procedure returns several cursors and loops through each and creates all the child objects.&nbsp; There are a few empty cursors with no results of which this is one of however there were 3 prior empty ones before this line was processed.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty baffled.&nbsp; My application is built against .net 4, my Oracle client is .net4 and my IIS application pool is set to not allow 32bit applications.</p>
<p>My CSLA dll is dated 15-Dec-2009 and shows as version 3.8.2.&nbsp; I believe I built it from the source code via VS2008 and I&#39;m not in VS2010.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated...&nbsp; I&#39;m totally baffled.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
