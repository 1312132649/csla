Using the standard BusinessListBase and BusinessBase combinations. They&#39;re represented on a WinForms form via two DevEx grids in a standard master/child relationship.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of attempting to support multi-select. In other words, if you select 2 Users, the Roles list shows the Roles shared by the 2 users. If you add or delete a role, it gets added or deleted to all selected users.</p>
<p>Anyone have ane ideas on how to go about implementing something like this? I&#39;ve thought about trying to use subclassing (or whatever we call it in C# &lt;grin&gt;), but I&#39;m not sure I know how to implement that with the Generics that CSLA uses. I&#39;ve also thought about trying to do it via interfaces, which seems the more likely way.</p>
<p>To make matters more complicated, I also have a data-bound combo-box that shows the currently-selected user&#39;s &quot;Scheme&quot;. I&#39;d love to be able to multi-select users, and change all their schemes at once using the combo-box. But this sounds even harder than the master/child issue, because of possible Begin/End Edit timings.</p>
<p>Has anyone tried something like this? Using CSLA? Anyone got any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>If you have something like the Infragistics grid, it does the sorting for you, even without SortedBindingList, and it supports multiple column sorting.&nbsp; So if your grid can do it, I&#39;d read up on that.</p>
<p>For your &quot;update selected rows&quot; issue, I&#39;d skirt the databinding issues by asking the cell to change its value directly.&nbsp; Programmatically do what the user would.&nbsp; The grid should act the same as if the user changed the values, and everything should just work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>That&#39;s how I&#39;d approach things, at least.</p>
