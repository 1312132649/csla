I have been using it for several months as it is using a web site as a client.</P>
<P>However, now I want to upgrade the website and use CSLA authentication to control access to my objects. When I change the "Authentication" configuration setting from "Windows" to "CSLA", it makes my business objects authenticate to the correct users and groups, but now I can't communicate with the BatchQueue. When I send a request to the BatchQueue from my website, the Windows Service stops running (probably crashing).</P>
<P>I tried changing the authentication of my BatchQueue server to "CSLA" but there was no change in the result. Is there a way to configure the BatchQueue so it will accept requests from a client configured with CSLA authentication?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
