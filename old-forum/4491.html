In other words, I want to be able to create custom lists of CourseInfo objects that I can add and remove items from.&nbsp; However, the actual courseinfo object should not be editable.&nbsp; </P>
<P>My problem is that when I try to create the list with an EditableRootCollection or an EditableRootList it wants the base object of the list (CourseInfo) to&nbsp;be editable.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I inherit from the ReadOnlyCollection or the ReadOnlyRootList, I cannot modify the contents of the list.&nbsp;I understand that each of objects are supposed to be in charge of saving themselves when you update a list.&nbsp; I'm new at trying to implement this framework and I was just wondering what kind of object I should use.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mtagliaf replied on Wednesday, March 12, 2008</h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">You need a new CourseInfo object that's read/write (BusinessBase).&nbsp; The properties on it can all be readonly, except for maybe the integer Position within the list.<br><br>When you go to save this object to the DB, you're not actually saving any data to the CourseInfo table, you're saving to the "which courses belong to which lists" tables.&nbsp; <br><br>Since this is a new behavior, you need a new class.<br><br><br></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>madonato replied on Wednesday, March 12, 2008</h2>That makes sense.
