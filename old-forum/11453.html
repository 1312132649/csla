<p>I have two projects, one for the .NET side, the other for the WinRT side...similar to what I&#39;ve done many times for SL projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my WinRT project, I&#39;ve defined a region that is encapsulated with <em>#if WINRT.</em> However, the code inside this block becomes greyed out, even though it is on the WinRT side.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Wednesday, July 04, 2012</h2><p>I think I posted too quickly.&nbsp; It looks like under the build tab, I see a conditional compilation symbol for NETFX_CORE.&nbsp; (I never realized until now that <em>that</em> is where the SILVERLIGHT symbol was also defined.)&nbsp; So I think I&#39;m good at this point, unless someone else tells me I still need to do something different.<span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small;"></span></span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 05, 2012</h2><p>In the consumer preview Microsoft didn&#39;t define a symbol, so I made one called WINRT.</p>
<p>In the release preview Microsoft defined NETFX_CORE, and I&#39;m switching to that.</p>
<p>I recommend using NETFX_CORE, because that is now the official symbol.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
