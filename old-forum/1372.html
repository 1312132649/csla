It just occurred to me that it could have something to do with the way the object was serialized to session state. I use an out-of-process stateserver to store session state. If I change this to be InProc everything works fine and dictionaries are deserialized correctly. But then of course InProc session state isn't serialized/deserialized.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
