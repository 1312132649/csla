<P>So here are my questions:</P>
<P>If I do paging in the SelectObject event, do I need to implement the IReportTotalCount interface in my List object?</P>
<P>Since I do filtering and sorting in the SelectObject event, am I forced to do paging there as well instead of doing it in DP_Fetch?</P>
<P>I mean if I have 20 contact records that are populated each time I fill my List (ReadonlyListbase), and 5 of them have last names that start with 'A', but they are not in order in the table, I would want to filter them first before paging.&nbsp; Because paging would pull the first 10 records thus excluding some of the contact records that have lastnames that begin with 'A'.&nbsp; Is this correct?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, January 29, 2008</h2>Yes, if you are going to filter/sort in the UI, then you must page in the UI as well. The three concepts are linked to each other. Well, more precisely, paging is dependent on any filter/sort, so the filter/sort must occur first (at or lower in the stack).</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dantruj replied on Tuesday, January 29, 2008</h2>Cool, thank you</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dantruj replied on Tuesday, January 29, 2008</h2><P>If filtering and sorting has to be done first before paging, then if I decide to use a stored procedure to page (only pull needed rows) then do I also have to do sorting and filtering in the stored procedure first?&nbsp; If that is true, then that defeats the purpose of FilteredBindingList and SortedBindingList while paging.</P>
<P>If I truly want to use the UI to do filtering and sorting, then I am forced to pull All records from the database first, which is a waste, unless I do some sort of cache at the UI.&nbsp; But this defeats the purpose of just pulling the rows you need.</P>
<P>Please explain how I can filter/sort and page in the SelectObject event while only pulling the records I need from the database (not pulling all records and just returning 10 from the BO)? or is this even possible?</P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The concept of paging is dependent on any filter/sort you apply.
So you must filter/sort before you can page the resulting data. It is a logical
progression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So yes, you must do the filter/sort before you apply any paging.
If you do the paging in the database, then you must do the filter/sort there
first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>If filtering and sorting has to be done first before paging, then if I
decide to use a stored procedure to page (only pull needed rows) then do I also
have to do sorting and filtering in the stored procedure first?&nbsp; If that
is true, then that defeats the purpose of FilteredBindingList and
SortedBindingList while paging.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>If I truly want to use the UI to do filtering and sorting, then I am forced
to pull All records from the database first, which is a waste, unless I do some
sort of cache at the UI.&nbsp; But this defeats the purpose of just pulling the
rows you need.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Please explain how I can filter/sort and page in the SelectObject event
while only pulling the records I need from the database (not pulling all
records and just returning 10 from the BO)? or is this even possible?<o:p></o:p></p>
