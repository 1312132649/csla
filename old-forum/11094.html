<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you plan to write an ebook about <span id="dnn_ctr4344_ProductPage_grdProducts_ctl05_lblDescription"> ASP.NET web applications, i purchase the ebook and the videos series about csla 3,8,2. and I would like to&nbsp; upgrade to CSLA 4 but i saw in your Ebook Series 4 you don&acute;t have a chapter for </span><span id="dnn_ctr4344_ProductPage_grdProducts_ctl05_lblDescription"> ASP.NET web applications, only for </span><span id="dnn_ctr4344_ProductPage_grdProducts_ctl05_lblDescription"> ASP.NET MVC.</span></p>
<p>Continue with your great work, I love CSLA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is mostly because there&#39;ve been few meaningful changes to Web Forms since 2005, and no changes to how CSLA supports Web Forms for many years. It was 2009 when I split the assemblies apart, but even that didn&#39;t change the functionality at all. I think the last time the Csla.Web functionality changed was in 2006...</p>
<p>What this means is that the chapter in the <em>Expert 2008 Business Objects</em> book on Web Forms development is still 100% relevant.</p>
<p>But there <em>are</em> a bunch of changes coming in .NET 4.5, and I suspect CSLA 4 version 4.5 will require some new features to support the new Web Forms capabiltiies that are coming. From what I&#39;ve seen, these new Web Forms features should be pretty cool, and that&#39;ll almost certainl require new book or video content to document how to use them with CSLA 4 version 4.5.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
