I'm working with NHibernate 2 years ago and I need to add CSLA (N Undo, databinding, ...) features into my projects.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question is how or what's the best design in order to integrate NHibernate and CSLA.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; In MVC (Model-View-Controller) I would design "clear" classes into Model (Model contains NHibernate declarations...). So I would declare bussines objects in View (Model hasn't to know what's CSLA, I think) inheriting from Model classes (entities). For example:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public class EntityBO : Model.Entity { ...<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in EntityBO, I would implement bussiness methods, ... In order to save or update these BOs I would implement a DAO pattern for each Model Entity class. For example, is I have a Project entity, I would implement a ProjectDAO with Save(Entity), Update(Entity), Delete(...), ... methods. When the user click on "Save" button I would perform --&gt; ProjectDAO.Save(new EntityBO(....)).<br><br>What about this approach?<br><br>Thanks in advanced.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, September 28, 2007</h2>I think NHibernate is typically used only in the DataPortal_XYZ methods.&nbsp; You wouldn't expose any NHibernate to the UI, because you'd be letting your data schema into that layer, which is one of the things you're trying to avoid.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Dawn replied on Saturday, September 29, 2007</h2>This has been discussed serval times, just search NHibernate in the forum.<br><br>And
