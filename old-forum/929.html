<P>Where is a good place to securely store a connection string?</P>
<P>Is the web.config file secure enough?</P>

<P>I'm able to distribute the application to the server in a pre-compiled form - obviously binary files are more secure than plain text files.&nbsp; Are the binary files in an ASP.NET pre-compiled solution obfuscated?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, August 17, 2006</h2>The web.config is just an xml file, so anyone that gains access to read that file will be able to see the u/p.&nbsp; If you're using .Net 2.0 though, there is support for encrypting connection strings.&nbsp; You should be able to find information on this via google.<br><br>.Net code by default is not obfuscated in anyway, asp.net or not.&nbsp; There are third party tools which do this, however its not totally secure (of course nothing is).&nbsp; Some of the better ones are able to encrypt strings stored within the binaries.<br><br>The MOST secure place to store the connection string would be an application server and setup the webserver to use remoting for running code in the DataPortal.&nbsp; With this method, you can do all of the above, but in addition, the server actually running your data access code is behind a firewall and internal to your company.&nbsp; If your web server is in a typical DMZ, the attacker would now have to break through two firewalls to get to the server which has the connection string.&nbsp;&nbsp; This comes at the expense of peformance though.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
