<p>I have bought the Expert Business objects and have read up to chapter 13 now. I really love the CSLA.NET framework (I&#39;ve built some test applications with it). With that said I&#39;m a very conservative programmer, I need others input.</p>
<p>I am&nbsp;building&nbsp;a robust forum, bing, e-commerce store into one and have been trying to learn the CSLA framework as much as possible the last two weeks to make a final decision. There are business rules that require high degree of performance.</p>
<p>I will be using Razor, ASP.NET MVC3, and EF (but all stored procedures).</p>
<p>If I could have anyones opinion on how my adventure will go beforehand using this framework it would be awesome. I understand there are areas I don&#39;t have to use CSLA, but with my limited knowledge of the framework I would love to get someone&#39;s opinion.</p>
<p>I need it to be highly scalable and&nbsp;unprecedented&nbsp;speed, as my user base is through the roof.</p>
<p>(it&#39;s difficult to give an opinion, but even if someone was like Yes, you won&#39;t run into any gladiator battles between MVC3 and CSLA would be great!)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Saturday, April 30, 2011</h2><p>Yes, MVC is one of the supported UIs you can use with Csla.&nbsp; One of the goals of the framework is to allow you to build scalable applications, which Csla enables by use of the dataportal.&nbsp; I doubt you&#39;d have any major issues building your business objects against Csla.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Paul Czywczynski replied on Saturday, April 30, 2011</h2><p>Is there a reason you want to use EF if you&#39;re going to use stored procedures? Seems to me you&#39;re adding another layer you don&#39;t need. EF uses ADO.NET behind the scene so why don&#39;t you cut out EF and just use ADO.NET. Then you don&#39;t have another layer of complexity to deal with. &nbsp;-Paul</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sky replied on Saturday, April 30, 2011</h2><p>I am most familiar with ADO.NET. So I think I may take your suggestion.</p>
<p>Just that when MS goes a certain direction I&#39;ve usually followed. But I&#39;ve read more over the last few days and agree. I should use ADO.NET</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, April 30, 2011</h2><p>That&#39;s probably a good choice. EF just doesn&#39;t work very well with stored procedures. At least not unless you&#39;ve specifically designed the stored procedures for use with EF. And if you have to go through that work, I&#39;m not sure I see the point...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
