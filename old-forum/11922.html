My credit card was debited the same day, and now, one week later, I have still not received the download link to obtain the eBook series.</p>
<p>Additionally, all three email messages I have sent regarding this situation to <a href="mailto:&#39;cslastore@lhotka.net&#39;">&#39;cslastore@lhotka.net&#39;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;have been ignored.</p>
<p>Is this a pervasive problem with the store? At this point I&#39;m going to dispute the charge on my credit card as I&#39;ve received nothing for my $79.00.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, April 06, 2013</h2><p>I am sorry you had a poor experience with the store.</p>
<p>To my knowledge the store has now responded to resolve your issue. If you didn&#39;t receive the email(s) from the store then that indicates an issue with email delivery and we may need to work through the issue here via the forum.</p>
<p>(there are rare cases where people simply can&#39;t receive our emails - I don&#39;t know why, given that we use gmail, but it does happen)</p>
<p>If you do want to dispute the charges I understand and of course we&#39;ll refund your money.</p>

<p>You may want to research why the order initially fell through the cracks as there were no emails in my SPAM folder - want to avoid the same inconvenience for others.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
