It is in the bug list to be fixed.</P>
<P>However, its priority dropped in 3.6 because PropertyStatus does a <EM>much</EM> better job of dealing with authorization, and I'm seriously considering dropping Authorizer at some point. Even if this bug were fixed, it is (comparatively) very inefficient.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, October 22, 2008</h2>Ahh.. didn't know it was a known issue.&nbsp; <br><br>Is there any good documentation on using PropertyStatus?&nbsp; It looks like it appeared in 3.6.&nbsp; Is it meant to replace ObjectStatus and Authorizer?<br><br>Thanks<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, October 22, 2008</h2>






 





<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>PropertyStatus is meant to replace Authorizer, and to handle
validation rules (all three severities), and to handle async busy notification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>It does not replace ObjectStatus. In Silverlight
CslaDataProvider actually replaces ObjectStatus. In WPF I still use
ObjectStatus, though as a resource, not a container. That&#8217;s a simpler
model.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
