<P>The only catch you may encounter, is that I don't think the Transactional attribute will work, because I don't think CE works with either EnterpriseServices or TransactionScope transactions.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>NetStream replied on Wednesday, March 18, 2009</h2>Thanks Rocky.&nbsp; I was thinking along the same lines with the exception of&nbsp;transaction attributes.&nbsp; The forum has info on SQL CE with the compact framework and the limitations of them.&nbsp; But, I could not find any information about whether CSLA.Net could be used with&nbsp;SQL CE and with the framework 3.5.&nbsp; I appreciate all the time and hard work you have invested in the framework ever since your very first book.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
