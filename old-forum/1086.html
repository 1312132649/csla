<P>I have previously tried to 'hookup' child objects to the event handler by attaching them in a custom addChild method in the parent list. However I found this technique worked great for manually added child objects, but I was clueless on how to add the handler if the object and children were loaded from a database during a fetch call.</P>
<P>Question is, what is the best way to add an event handle to a child object??</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
