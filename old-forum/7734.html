<P>I suggest that your BO contains a method named LoadData (or something like that)&nbsp;which accepts the XML document as an argument. Then you parse out each value and load it into each BO property (not field) so that your rules for each property get run.</P>

<P>XmlSerializer and DCS require the target object to have a public default constructor, and to have only public read/write properties. Most business objects don't meet those criteria, so you can't just deserialize into most business objects directly.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
