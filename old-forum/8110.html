<P>I've been trying for three weeks now, and I guess it's time to seek advice.&nbsp; Got the C#2008 book and bought CSLA30cs.pdf.</P>
<P>I cannot figure out how to properly design my business objects and bind them to my Windows Forms controls.</P>
<P>Before I go into a long and detailed explanation of my current design and the problem I'm having, perhaps it's better to ask what business objects you would suggest for the following case:</P>
<P>I have a list of products with a product code and a description.&nbsp; Each product <FONT size=2>comes a number of varieties with different colors and prices. I have a database with Products and Varieties tables.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I want a WinForms UI with a main ListView for the product codes.&nbsp; Next to it two TextBoxes to be able to edit the product code and the description of the selected product.&nbsp; Then a secondary ListView containing variety color codes.&nbsp; And finally two TextBoxes to edit the color code and price of the selected product variety.&nbsp; Plus two sets of Add and Delete buttons to add and delete both products and product varieties.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The changes in the TextBoxes should be reflected in the ListViews.&nbsp; So, if a product code is changed, so should the corresponding entry in the main ListView.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>What business objects do you suggest I use for the list of products?&nbsp; I'm currently using a combination of a Read-Only Root Collection with Read-Only Root objects for the main list.&nbsp; Which is probably why I can't insert new products into the list?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Thanks,&nbsp; Joris.</FONT><FONT size=2></P></FONT></FONT></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, December 09, 2009</h2>If you want to be able to edit the values you need to use BusinessListBase and BusinessBase.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
