<P>That was on a Virtual PC where everything it does is usually excruciatingly slow.</P>
<P>If it takes too long to render all those properties on a page, I don't think the Csla code will have anything to do with it.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Rayk replied on Friday, August 18, 2006</h2>Thanks once again for all the support.&nbsp; My first post on this forum, and I got the confirmations I needed to go forward within an hour, and more confirmations by the next morning.&nbsp; Just the kind of community support that makes me think using CSLA will be a good decision.&nbsp; <br><br>- RayK<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Rayk replied on Friday, August 18, 2006</h2>Thanks to your help, I got this to work.&nbsp; <br><br>Just for info, using the CodeSmith templates to generate the ReadOnlyBase object and ReadOnlyList object doesn't seem to work.&nbsp; It only gets you part of the way there.&nbsp; The problem seems to be two things:<br><br>The ReadOnlyList object trys to pass the entire SafeDataReader object to the ReadOnlyBase object, which the ReadOnlyBase object doesn't have a method for.&nbsp; <br><br>The second problem is that the ReadOnlyBase object created with CodeSmith templates is primarily for fetching a single ReadOnlyBase object.&nbsp; It is not designed to be created within the ReadOnlyList.&nbsp; <br><br>So, the procedure I used was:<br>1.&nbsp; Modify the ReadOnlyBase object to accept all 20 fields as parameters, just like the ProjectInfo object from the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;  (And created the INTERNAL method for creation).<br>2.&nbsp; Modify the ReadOnlyList object to pass in all the fields required by the ReadOnlyBase object, just like the ProjectList object from the book.&nbsp; <br><br>Seems to load 500+ rows without any detectable speed delay.&nbsp; <br><br>-RayK<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ChristianPena replied on Friday, August 18, 2006</h2>I noticed the same issue with the templates.

<P>RayK,</P>
<P>I don't have any problem generating this type of combo using CodeSmith.&nbsp; I thinkg you may choose the wrong template here.</P>
<P>What templates do you use to generate these objects.</P>

<P>The original VB templates were a good starting point but I am not sure they were ever 100% finished.</P>
<P>I believe Ricky has been updating the C# templates all along and I assume they are in good shape.</P>
<P>Check out <A href="http://www.onelittlevictory.com/">http://www.onelittlevictory.com/</A>&nbsp; for good samples of each CSLA type and how it should "normally" be structured. Use this to update your templates as needed.</P>

<P>To concure with JoOfMetL, you'll need to use ReadOnlyRootList &amp; ReadOnlyChild template.&nbsp; ReadOnlyRoot template is to be used when you need to&nbsp;retrieve a single object. </P>
<P>There is no document that explain the purpose of each template, however&nbsp;by completing&nbsp;chapter 7 and 8 from the book, these template should be pretty easy to use.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Joe, welcome back, long time no post ;)</P>
<P>C# templates for Csla 2.0 are a complete rewrite to handle&nbsp;many kinds&nbsp;of data source.&nbsp; Imo, they are much better and more stable than the 1.x version.&nbsp; Allan Nielsen has converted these templates to vb version.&nbsp; If you haven't already try it, please check them out at <A href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=CSLAcontrib">CslaContrib</A>.</P>
<P>Ricky</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, August 22, 2006</h2><P>Ricky,</P>
<P>Thanks for the info.</P>
<P>Allan has done some excellent work converting the C# templates to VB.</P>
<P>When I build my 2.0 templates I plan to review the output from Allan's VB templates and modify mine to include things I may have overlooked. </P>
<P>Thanks again&nbsp;for pointing this out.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
