<p class=MsoNormal>I've read Expert C# 2008 Business Objects - good read! - and
am now trying to learn by doing. I've taken the Rolodex example for Silverlight
and am modifying code here and there to see how it works.<br>
<br>
I've added some tables of my own to the database and some objects to accompany
them to the BusinessClasses in Rolodex.Business.Server. BUT they don't seem to
have 'joined' the project / solution properly (e.g. they don't appear in the
list of shortcuts in the Rolodex.Business.Client project) and don't have
debugging information created for them. What am I missing out?<br>
<br>
When I try to use them, my code fails in CslaDataProvider.cs in Refresh() as
this line doesn't manage to return a type:<br>
<br>
Type objectType = Type.GetType(_objectType);<br>
<br>
I don't think I can be far off getting this right, though am far enough away at
the moment to be stuck! Thanks for any help, James.<br>

That's got me to the next stage...<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>James Thomas replied on Tuesday, January 13, 2009</h2>Ok... the next stage. I can create my objects and have them read data from my database - I have a working application.<br><br>One thing that's making development really difficult is that I can't debug the server objects. I can step through the silverlight code - the visual and the business objects running on the client - but I just get 'The breakpoint will not currently be hit' for the server code. I'm sure there's an easy solution.
