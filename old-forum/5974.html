My issue is PropertyHasChanged is forcing the user to press Tab twice to exit a textbox control when a change is made. I read in another post that a Null Exception caused by ValidationRules was the cause. I have commented out my validation rules, but that didn't help.</P>
<P><STRONG>However, if&nbsp;I replace PropertyHasChanged with Me.IsDirty, then a single Tab works. </STRONG>This is not feasible, as I do need to CheckRules method called by PropertyHasChanged.</P>
<P>I am using CSLA Runtime Version v2.0.50727 (version 2.1.4.0) on .Net 2.0 framework.</P>
<P>Hoping someone can help me out on this.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

That is compatible with .NET 2.0, and includes a lot of bug fixes around data binding. This issue sounds vaguely familiar, and I suspect it was addressed in 3.0.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
