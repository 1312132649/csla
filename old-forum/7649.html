Is this correct and will this be added (along with some other related properties)  to CSLA in future releases?  Actually, my only need right now though is to set the client endpoint address programatically if that's possible. I appreciate any suggestions.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 17, 2009</h2>The .NET WcfProxy class is designed so you can subclass it and easily control nearly all aspects of how the server URL and/or actual WCF proxy is created.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
