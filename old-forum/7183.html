<P>It is all about trade-offs between performance and security, scalability, maintainability, etc.</P>
<P>The more reuse you have, the more coupling you have. At some point (very rapidly) the cost of coupling outweighs the benefit of reuse and you lose.</P>
<P>The more security you have, the more overhead and complexity you have. At some point (very rapidly) the cost of security becomes quite high - and may or may not be worth it, depending on your actual threat analysis.</P>
<P>The more abstractions you employ (for things like data access), the lower your performance, and often the higher your complexity. It seems counter-intuitive that abstraction would increase complexity, but look at dependency injection and inversion of control and the complexity they cause - all because of increased abstraction...</P>
<P>In Chapter 18 I discuss a wide range of options for implementing data access in CSLA .NET. I discuss many of&nbsp;the same options, and provide code samples, in the <A href="http://store.lhotka.net">N-Tier Data Access video</A>.</P>
<P>CSLA .NET allows you to use the highly efficient, but not overly abstract, raw ADO.NET technology. You can use it directly in your objects (simplest), or in a separate DAL using the System.Data interfaces (more complex, but better layering).</P>
<P>Everything other than raw ADO.NET will cost you in performance, because everything else (LINQ to SQL, EF, TableAdapter/DataTable, NHibernate, LLBLgen, etc) is an abstraction layer on top of raw ADO.NET. So by definition they will all cost you performance - but people use them in the hopes that they provide more productivity and thus are worth it.</P>
<P>And they probably <EM>are worth it</EM>. Hardware is much cheaper than development/maintenance costs. If you save just a few hours of development time, you can buy another server. A bigger server.</P>
<P>What I'm suggesting, is that architecture is about making hard choices - and they are not all technical. They are overall business choices. A good software architect will do cost/benefit analysis that includes development, maintanence, hardware, infrastructure, testing, usability and other factors relevant to the project.</P>
<P>Sure, using EF is slower than raw ADO.NET. But if I can spend $10k to buy a bigger server (to offset the lost performance) and the productivity offered by EF saves me $20k in software development costs, this seems like a win. </P>
<P>Whether EF actually saves you that much time, I'm not sure - that's something you need to decide. Using code-gen tools, raw ADO.NET is terribly productive...</P>
<P>Personally I default to use raw ADO.NET, because I really don't find it to be that hard to use, and it provides the best performance. But if my business requirements include database independance (SQL/Oracle for example) then I'd give serious consideration to using some higher level of abstraction (because I don't want to deal with the mismatches in terms of data type conversions, database exception types, etc).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Programmer1987 replied on Monday, June 29, 2009</h2>شكرا جزيلاً <br><br>thanks alot Mr.Lhotka , I read your reply carefully .<br>your reply is as a new starting point to study more in Software architecture and know how to think about <br>trade offs between performance and security, scalability, maintainability, etc [as you said&nbsp; :) ]<br><br>so I think when I used linq to sql in The Data_Portal and moved the Linq.Employee Object to <br>Lib.Emplyee Object , I think this is not so bad way as I thought before .<br>Yes It need more time but my program is multilayered .<br><br>thanks<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
