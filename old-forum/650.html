<P>If you click on the links within an item it opens the browser window inside the application.&nbsp; Or you can open to a new browser window if required.</P>

<P>I saw your recommendation about Sharp Reader and gave it a try and have been <STRONG><EM>very</EM></STRONG> happy with it, as you might expect.<img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></P>
<P>But for some reason it hasn't "seen" a single posting here since 9/15.&nbsp; Are you experiencing this too?</P>
<P>I thought maybe a forum change in the RSS url may have caused it, but it still appears to be identical to the one I'm using.</P>
<P>FYI, I have the forum properties set to keep messages for a <STRONG>year</STRONG>, unlimited max items, and refresh every hour.</P>
<P>Thanks for the original tip and anything you can offer about this issue.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Thursday, September 28, 2006</h2><P>Now that you've mentioned it, I've checked and I agree with your comments.&nbsp; I don't think it's a problem with SharpReader as other blogs/feeds that I am subscribed to&nbsp;are receiving recent updates in SharpReader.</P>
<P>So that would point to a possible problem on the server, although looking at the RSS URL it does seem to be okay.</P>
<P>So can anyone else using a different RSS reader either confirm/deny if their reader is correctly seeing recent posts?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 28, 2006</h2>I just checked, and RSS Bandit is (for me) retrieving current posts.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ScepticalSwede replied on Friday, September 29, 2006</h2><P>ve noticed as of late similiar problem with SharpReader. I only get new postings from this group every 2 or 3 days or so. I don't have this problem with any other RSS-feed and SharpReader</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
