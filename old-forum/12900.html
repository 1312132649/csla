But don&#39;t want to set the bar too high.<br /><br />Opened the Csla.winrt solution. Created a new project of type &quot;Empty Class Library (C#/XAML for HTML5) named Csla.CSHTML5. Changed the namespace to &quot;Csla&quot; Added conditional symbol SILVERLIGHT. Copied all the files and linked files from Csla.Silverlight project by editing the Csla.CSHTML5.csproj in a text editor.<br /><br />Ended up with errors as expected. A lot of them them ambiguous reference between &#39;System.NonSerializedAttribute&#39; and &#39;Csla.Serialization.NonSerializedAttribute&#39; and between &#39;System.SerializableAttribute&#39; and &#39;Csla.Serialization.SerializableAttribute&#39;. That I don&#39;t know how to get rid of.<br /><br />Browsing the project looking at the using statements I can see that these are missing:<br />using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;<br />using System.Net.Http;<br />using System.Text.RegularExpressions;<br />using System.Xml.Linq;<br /><br />Also I noticed that IEditableObject, INotifyDataErrorInfo, INotifyPropertyChanging, System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker, DoWorkEventHandler, RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler, ProgressChangedEventHandler, System.ComponentModel.AsyncCompletedEventArgs, XmlDictionaryReader, DataContractSerializer, LinkedList<br />&nbsp;was missing.</p>

<p>DataAnnotations don&#39;t exist on all platforms (Xamarin for example) so CSLA actually includes its own implementation for those platforms. If these guys don&#39;t have it that shouldn&#39;t be an issue, as we can pull in our existing implementation.</p>
<p>The other missing stuff looks like something that could be overcome either by having them implement the components, or by having CSLA implement them for this platform.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>wilfreds replied on Thursday, June 11, 2015</h2><p>Thanks. Removing NonSerializedAttribute.cs and SerializationAttribute.cs, and adding the DataAnnotations folder helped a lot. If I close all files and do a rebuild it will tell me that I have 55 errors.<br /><br />Regular expressions is also next on the list that they plan to implement.<br /><br />Wilfred</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 11, 2015</h2><p>I believe regex is used in just one rule in Csla.Rules, so you could eliminate that with a compiler directive.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
