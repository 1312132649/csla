I'm hoping to pass the form a BO and have generic save btn that calls bo.save.</P>
<P>I can't figure out how to declare a public variable I can place any&nbsp;Businessbase of T in.&nbsp; I was able to use core.businessbase, but it doesn't expose save.&nbsp; I also tried to cast my object to businessbase with no success</P>
<P>I'm new to vb just moved from delphi so I maybe missing something obvious.</P>
<P>I searched the forum and found some discussion of this, but the solutions seemed overly complicated.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>I'm still passing it as csla.core.businessbase and casting as Isaveable when I need to save.&nbsp; This gives me access to some of the other businessbase functionalty.</P>
