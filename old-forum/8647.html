<p>We have Maximum Length validation rules for some properties in our business object. However what we would like to do ideally, is bind MaxLength on a textbox to this validation rule to stop invalid lengths being entered in the first place. Has anyone else tired this?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

You can get a list (string[] array) of rule:// URI items that describe all the rules attached to all properties for the object.</p>
<p>You can then use the RuleDescriptor type to parse the rule:// URI values into parts, including things like the property name, rule name and rule arguments.</p>
<p>That should make it relatively easy to find the StringMaxLength rule items and get the max length value for each.</p>
<p>Once you have that information, you then need to design an API to expose the information to the UI in a way that your UI can consume the information.</p>
<p>If you are in SL or WPF you could possibly subclass PropertyStatus and just add a MaxLength property, then bind the TextBox control&#39;s length property to PropertyStatus.</p>
<p>If you are in another UI technology you&#39;ll need a slightly different approach, but the concept would be similar.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>maridob replied on Tuesday, June 07, 2011</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>
