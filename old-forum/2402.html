That might provide more clear separation for calling your different sprocs - though I could see how both DP_F methods might just set up the SqlCommand object and then call a private helper to do the actual work, because I bet (other than the sproc setup) it is the same in both cases.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonWright replied on Sunday, February 25, 2007</h2>Thanks for the reply Rocky, I went with the simple if/else for the moment but if things get more complex along the way I'll have a look at&nbsp; extending CriteriaBase.<br><br>Jon<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
