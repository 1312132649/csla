Skipping through some of the post here, I see that the CSLA 3.5 uses LINQ and I think the WCF libraries.</P>
<P>As we all know, the .Net 3.0/3.5 introduced a lot of new technologies, but what I would like to know is what specific features of these technologies are used in the new CSLA 3.5 and to what extent must someone be aware of them in order to understand the inner workings of the new CSLA 3.5.</P>
<P>If people wanting to use the CSLA 3.5 need to be proficient in all these new .Net 3.0/3.5 technologies to work conformable with the CSLA 3.5 its going to be a pretty daunting task…….. <BR></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>triplea replied on Wednesday, April 09, 2008</h2><P>LINQ and WCF are entirely optional. As far as LINQ is concerned you have the LINQ to SQL part which can be replaced with any data access technology you prefer (raw ADO etc etc). Also a LINQ to CSLA part has been implemented but I did not yet have a chance to check it out. Its usage is optional though and not essential.</P>
<P>I am a newbie in .Net 3.5 but did not find it daunting at all to use CSLA 3.5. As a matter of fact I was waiting for a release (well at least a beta) before I started playing with .Net 3.5. When .Net 2.0 was released, I got hooked on it when CSLA 2.0 was released. It helped me grasp concepts such as generics a lot better than most articles and examples out there. So I think it most definately is worth giving it a go!</P>
<P>In any case most of the .Net 3/3.5 options are still optional. Good to know since you will be able to judge better what options suit you but still not 100% necessary. </P>
<P>Hope you give CSLA 3.5 a go!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, April 12, 2008</h2><P><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/MyPhilosophyOnUsingNewTechnologies.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/MyPhilosophyOnUsingNewTechnologies.aspx</A></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
