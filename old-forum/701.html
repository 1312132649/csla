<P>The template EditableRootList makes reference to <EM>item.DeleteSelf().</EM></P>
<P>The template EditableRoot has no such method in it.&nbsp; That's a bummer, to say the least.&nbsp; It does have a <EM>DataPortal_DeleteSelf()</EM> routine which obviously is intended to serve a similar purpose.&nbsp; </P>
<P>However, it makes me a bit concerned to have another class call a Data Access Layer (DAL) method in my business object.</P>
<P>So, should the EditableRootList template have called <EM>DataPortal_DeleteSelf()</EM> instead, or should the EditableRoot template have included a <EM>DeleteSelf()</EM> method that just calls the DAL method, or am I missing something?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 21, 2006</h2>The reason for this is that EditableRootList must contain <EM>child</EM> objects.

<P>Um...&nbsp; That confusalates me to no end!<BR>(Confusalate is a highly technical term in my part of the world.)</P>
<P>I just assumed that Editable<STRONG>Child</STRONG>List contained <STRONG>child</STRONG> objects and Editable<STRONG>Root</STRONG>List contained <STRONG>root</STRONG>/parent objects.</P>
<P>So, if Editable<STRONG>Root</STRONG>List contains <STRONG>child</STRONG> objects, what does Editable<STRONG>Child</STRONG>List contain?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 21, 2006</h2><P>Child objects <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /></P>
<P>I think I was pretty clear in chapters 6 and 7 (and I think chapter 2) that you can only have one root object, and everything else must be a child. A root object forms the top of a conceptual "transaction" in memory, and a root has a <EM>containment</EM> relationship with all the other objects in the graph.</P>
<P>You can have a root object, or a root collection, but only one per object graph.</P>
<P>Then you can have as many child objects as you choose - some of which might be <EM>parent</EM> objects that have their own children. But if that parent object isn't the root object, then it is also a child.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Monday, July 24, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>

<P>You'll have to admit that your book - well written as it is! - is a lot to bite off and chew.&nbsp; I'll look thru those chapters again.&nbsp; It won't be the first time, either!</P>
<P>What I understood you to just say is the only time I would use an editable root template is if I was never going to put it into a csla collection class?&nbsp; That would make that template pretty rare to use?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>david.wendelken replied on Monday, July 24, 2006</h2><P>And that's why "switchable" objects are useful?&nbsp; Because they could be a root when you need one, or a child when you need one?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 24, 2006</h2>

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=247005914-24072006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>However, the use of switchable objects almost always means 
your object model is flawed. Yes, there are a few cases where switchable objects 
really can make sense, but 9 times out of 10 they are a symptom of data-centric 
object design.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<P>What I'm more interested in, is why the SwitchableObject template doesn't have a DeleteSelf()...but that's in another thread.&nbsp; ;-)</P>

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=606105614-24072006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>What is far less common is an editable root collection. It 
is very rare (outside admin screens) to need to directly get an editable 
collection. Where I mostly use this template is when creating admin screens 
(look at the Admin\Roles class in ProjectTracker), because then the user really 
does need to interact with a collection as the top-level 
construct.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
