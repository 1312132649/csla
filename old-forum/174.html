<P>But with a web site project the controls like CslaDataSource aren't there.&nbsp; What's weird is that it actually shows up in the toolbox for a windows form project, but I've got nothing for the web project.</P>
<P>Is there something wrong here I can fix?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brent replied on Tuesday, May 23, 2006</h2><P>After you have referenced Csla in your web project, right click your toolbox and select "Choose items."&nbsp; Try sorting the list by name and you should see the Csla specefic toolbox items.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Tuesday, May 23, 2006</h2><P>I know about doing that.</P>
<P>With VS2005 I've never had to do that with Windows Forms projects.&nbsp; All the CSLA controls just show up in the toolbox without me doing anything special to add them.</P>
<P>Is it supposed to work that way with web projects as well?&nbsp; I did check the Choose Items list and actually the CslaDataSource is checked.&nbsp; Maybe just something weird going on with my machine.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h2><P>Ok, this is weird.&nbsp; I have a big giant solution a la ProjectTracker where I have CSLA, my business object library, a WinForms solution and a Web solution all in one.</P>
<P>In the WinForms&nbsp;project everything works as normal.</P>
<P>When I look at the properties/references of the web site project I have only the business library listed.&nbsp; If I remove that then the CSLA libraries show up in the list.&nbsp; If I add the business library project back in the CSLA stuff disappears.&nbsp; If I try to manually add CSLA at that point it tells me a reference to CSLA already exists.&nbsp; I'm presuming it is tracking through the business library and not re-listing projects referenced indirectly through it.</P>
<P>The problem is that the CSLA controls only show up in the toolbox when they are visible in the references list.</P>
<P>Has anybody else dealt with this or is nobody doing any ASP.NET with CSLA?&nbsp; Or is there just something hosed with my Visual Studio?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h2>I eventually got this to work normal through some combination of removing and adding references and using the Choose Items on the toolbox.&nbsp; Couldn't repeat if my life depended on it, but at least I'm productive again.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skaue replied on Monday, October 08, 2007</h2>I don't know if this might spare your life, but this is how I did it.<br><br>I opened my solution (Web Application Project) that already references CSLA and had a working aspx with a CSLAdatasource control. (I don't know if all this is required for it to work).<br><br>I rightclick toolbox under General and clicked Choose items...<br>In the first tab I pressed Browse and pointed to the csla.dll in my "Solution Items"-folder (custom self-made folder).<br>When the dll has been loaded there will be several new items in the "items-list" and I just checked all of them and pressed OK.<br><br>Done!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rexhxiao replied on Monday, October 08, 2007</h2><DIV id=result_box>Support is not the only web project? <BR>You try to open a web project .<BR><BR>In my case ,It only appeared in web project .<BR>The other four components appeared in the win project.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skaue replied on Tuesday, October 09, 2007</h2>What components are we talking about here? The one I've seen so far is the CSLADataSource. What other four are there?<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
