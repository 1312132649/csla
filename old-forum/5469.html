So I'm looking for a mechanism with wich I can notify the 'other' applications of any changes so they can update their 'view'.</P>
<P>In the past I've seen som discussion her about how one could accomplish this, but I couldn't find it here and it was years ago and things have changed since then. so that solution might even be outdated.</P>
<P>maybe someone can help me out or point me in the right direction.</P>
<P>thanks,<BR>Jurjen.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, September 25, 2008</h2><P>As I recall Petar (Kozul ?) had something called ActiveObjects which could be bolted on to the CSLA framework. I have not heard much about it since CSLA 1.x days. But I thought many people were using it back then. Even if you don't use it "as is", I think some people claimed it helped them implement the Observer pattern for their own frameworks.</P>

<P>Thanks for your response, but I am using ActiveObjects and it can't&nbsp;used for communicating with the same (ot other) apps on other pc's in the network. It's designed for use within the application to notify the parent object of changes in child-objects...</P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>I converted it to C# on VS2005 (Framework 2.0) put a lot of work on testing (unpluging cables, etc). There was some obscure framework lock bug. But now it works.</FONT></P>

<P>Though I haven't implemented it yet, I have found an alternative to this using WCF in a book written by Juval Lowy, 'Programming WCF Services'. The code is part of a framework wich comes with the book (including the source-code). Look for the 'Publish-Subscribe' Service.</P>
<P>I got the example to work just fine in no time at all and will be implementing this in my WinApp in the coming weeks.</P>
<P>Hope this helps.<BR><BR>Regards,<BR>Jurjen.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cash_pat replied on Monday, November 24, 2008</h2>Sorry, VS2005 version of MSDN</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Sunday, January 18, 2009</h2><P>The URI is</P>

<P>According to the EULA I can't distribute the original file. I have a derivative in C# that improves on the lock area (this is a well known .NET Framework shortcoming) using <FONT face="Courier New">TimedLock</FONT> instead of <FONT face="Courier New">Lock</FONT></P>

If you are lucky it might do a lot of the work for you since it can replicate changes to data between multiple nodes...<br><br>It's worth to have a lock at e.g. <a href="http://www.sharedcache.com/cms/shared_cache_topology.aspx#dis">http://www.sharedcache.com/cms/shared_cache_topology.aspx#dis<br></a><br>Hope this helps,<br>Patrick<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
