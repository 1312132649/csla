They are virtual machines, and the backup scheme takes them offline,<br />copies the vhd's and puts them back online.<br /><br />Rocky<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: Vinodonly [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Wednesday, September 09, 2009 7:06 AM<br />To: rocky@lhotka.net<br />Subject: Re: [CSLA .NET] www.lhotka.net down?<br /><br />I have also reported this before that is happenning regularly spcially<br />between 9:30 to 11:00 AM (GMT +2:00)<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, September 09, 2009</h2>I think you mean GMT -6, not +6 :-)<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, September 09, 2009</h2>Hmm, we'll I'm GMT -4, so it should be up for me, since EDT isn't that much off from CDT.  I know Rocky backs up his server when its night for the USA, but my problem was during daytime hours in the USA, which is why I thought it odd.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
