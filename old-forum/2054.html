<P>I probably spend 2-3 hours every week dealing with the stupid VS 205 forms designer error where it says it can't find some Type when I try to load the form or user control up in the designer.&nbsp; Everything is all perfectly fine, it's just the designer still (even after SP1) has some bug about the way it loads stuff into memory that gets its panties in a bunch every once in a while.&nbsp; The old exit VS, restart VS, compile project, cross fingers, say 3 hail marys, try loading form again.... dance is getting old.</P>
<P>I've probably griped about this before, but I'd like to get a feel for how common this is.&nbsp; Are you guys sailing along crash free or is everyone just putting up with this nonsense?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Sunday, December 31, 2006</h2>Putting up with this nonsense here...<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Sunday, December 31, 2006</h2>I experience this every so often as well.&nbsp; On the other hand, since moving to CSLA last year, I have found the number of times that it happens has gone significantly down as the forms are much simpler.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cds replied on Sunday, December 31, 2006</h2><P>I have experienced this periodically too... usually when I can least afford the time to deal with it!&nbsp;Grrr&nbsp;<img src="/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry [:@]" /></P>
<P>I usually find that rebuilding my solution fixes the problem, though not always. It is a pain in the neck... I hope MS is doing something about it!</P>
