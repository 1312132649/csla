I am looking for a&nbsp;control that will take a business object and&nbsp;dynamically display and bind the properties and collections of the business object. A generic&nbsp;control like this could be used to perform basic prototyping of the business object.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Paul Czywczynski replied on Saturday, October 11, 2008</h2>I can't think of anything off the top of my head that will automatically create a form based on an object. I am sure there is an obscure niche of tools out there somewhere. Something on the WPF side that might help you, XAML Power Toys.<br><br><a href="http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/xaml-power-toys/">http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/xaml-power-toys/</a><br><br>I couple features of interest:<br><ul><li>Create Business Form For Class - quickly create a form complete
with bindings that are easily associated with properties on the source
class
</li><li>Create Business Form - quickly create a form complete with bindings if desired&nbsp;

The applications follow very closely the pattern in the PTracker application. It requires a database. Samples applications generated from the Northwind and PTracker databases are available at <A href="http://www.eurowisesoft.com">www.eurowisesoft.com</A>.</P>
