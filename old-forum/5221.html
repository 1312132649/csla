<P>This sample goes very well with Linq to Sql approach. However; my quesiton is,&nbsp;do I use the same approach to start my new project with Linq to Entity? I haven't gone deep into it, but I feel like there&nbsp;will be&nbsp;some overlaps between the Enitity Framework and CSLA. </P>
<P>Any comments?!</P>
<P>By the way, Why&nbsp;does the&nbsp;"Index of Code generation" page miss out the&nbsp;CSLA Factory in its list? This one kicks butts!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, August 10, 2008</h2><P>I do need to add CSLA Factory to the list (I thought I had actually - maybe I didn't click save or something).</P>
<P>For EF version 1 it will be used in much the same way as LINQ to SQL. EF version 1 has a lot of limitations and though it does better mapping than L2S it has pretty much the same n-tier story (which isn't compelling).</P>
<P>Hopefully future versions of EF will offer some more powerful capabilities, and I'm enhancing the data portal in CSLA 3.6 in anticipation of that possibility.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mcsean replied on Sunday, August 10, 2008</h2><P>Thanks Rocky! I will be waiting for the 3.6 release.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I agree with you that at this point may be it is a better idea to stay with L2S. EF is tricky when it comes to working with CSLA in terms of architecture. On the&nbsp;second through, EF &amp; CSLA approach result in a&nbsp;clearer&nbsp;separation&nbsp;of ORM and business logic&nbsp;layer - a perfect&nbsp;match.&nbsp;Hope we don't have to wait for long.</P>
