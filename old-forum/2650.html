<br>
I had the joy of presenting at the Microsoft Code Camp 7 in Waltham (suburb
of Boston), MA this last weekend. A lecture on "Building Scalable
Enterprise Systems In C#\.NET Using A Framework. And was surprised at
how many attending the lecture had already either heard Rocky speak, or
read his book, or were in the process of reading his book, or trying
out the CSLA framework. For awhile, I thought I had nothing new to offer the
group, but there were patient and humoured me none-the-less. On a more
serious note, I actually think a number of people were trying to get a
guage of how practical the CSLA framework really was for actual
enterprise systems. I hope, I was able to pursuade some to at least
stay the course, until they had given it at least a good test run. <br>
<br>
As in my other presentation on enterprise development where I used CSLA
as part of the example, I gave away a few of Rocky's books, encouraged people to
come to this forum, talked about how Ricky Supit's CSLA CodeSmith
templates helped me write my demo application. This time around, I
showed those templates in action, which really caught peoples
attention. Thanks Ricky. AND AS ALWAYS, a very big thank you to Rocky,
for providing such an interesting tool that I can demo as part of the solution ot building enterprise systems. I love using it.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Des Nolan<br>
