<p>first of all:</p>
<p>I&#39;m testing CSLA.NET to evaluate whether this could get our standard way to implement business objects. I already read most of the book &quot;Expert C# 2008 Business Objects&quot;, but unfortunately there&#39;s not much information about the DynamicBindingListBase class.</p>
<p>I implemented the stereotypes as descripted in the book or the current &quot;Templates&quot; (DynamicRootBindingList and DynamicRoot), but it doesn&#39;t work as expected.</p>
<p>As far as I understood the main purpose of the&nbsp;DynamicBindingListBase is to use it with DataGrid binding to automatically trigger&nbsp;persistence&nbsp;after each single item was edited instead of&nbsp;waiting&nbsp;on a manual &quot;Save&quot; call.</p>
<p>The problem is that this doesn&#39;t happen in my case. Actually I would have thought that the DynamicBindingListBase should trigger save which actually should result in calls to DataPortal_Insert/Update/Delete as soon as the user moves to the next row or &quot;commits&quot; it changes.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

I made a mistake concerning the parameters of the DataPortal_Update/Insert/Delete methods. I changed the base class from&nbsp;<span>BusinessBindingListBase to DynamicBindingListBase, but then forgot to remove the parameters from the DataPortal_XYZ functions.</span></p>
<p>Sorry... If you like to, you can remove this thread.</p>
