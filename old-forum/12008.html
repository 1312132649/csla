<ul>
<li>Is <b>EF Code First </b>going to cover your needs (primarily classes with direct mapping to tables)? </li>
<li>or can you live with many<b> Data Transformations </b>(somewhat similar to business objects)?</li>
<li>is DataAnnotation rules sufficient for your application?</li>
<li>do you need Authorization rules? </li>
<li>Is EF available for all your platforms (Win8/WinPhone/Silverlight/...)?</li>
</ul>
<p>And probably more questions that should be answered. </p>
<p>I regard EF as primarily a data access technology and the come and go quite often from Microsoft. </p>
<p>So for my preference - I like the CSLA coding style, business objects and rule engine and the fact that my code can run on number of platforms with a minimum of change.</p>
<p>EF and corresponding tooling in Visual Studio is very nice in a Web application and if you only need the DataAnnotation rules (or add custom code these in the Postback).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Monday, June 10, 2013</h2><p>It seems like EF is a big piece of infrastructure to learn, understand and maintain just to use as a back end for CSLA.&nbsp; Seems like there is a lot of duplicate work.&nbsp; It seems like you would either just use EF or use CSLA with a regular ado.net backend.&nbsp; Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Jon</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, June 10, 2013</h2><p>I often use EF to create my DAL behind CSLA objects. I use model first, because I am using EF to make it easier to create the DAL and I don&#39;t really want or need specialized entity types. The reason for using EF like this is that it is often simpler than hand-crafting raw ADO.NET code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are good and hand crafting that code, or are using automation (like codesmith) to create the ADO.NET DAL code, then I wouldn&#39;t necessarily use EF.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
