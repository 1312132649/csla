<P>Building the project and including a reference to the CSLA .dlls is no problem; however, I want to include those compiled .dlls in my project in such a way that they are saved to SourceSafe.&nbsp; Typically, I just drop copies of them into my bin folder, include them in the project, establish references to them and move on.</P>
<P>I'm wondering if that is the correct way to do it though.</P>
<P>Is there a more "correct" way to include these CSLA dlls as a part of my project?</P>
<P>The goals here are:</P>
<P>1: I don't want a full copy of the CSLA framework included in my project as a part of the solution.&nbsp; I only need the compiled DLLS.</P>
<P>2: For the sake of disaster recovery it is important that a user be able to install a copy of VS2005 and open the project from SourceSafe and immediately be able to be up and running.&nbsp; I don't want them to worry about having a folder stashed somewhere, or something in the GAC, or any of that nonsense.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So, if you include the compiled DLLS in your project where should they be?&nbsp; How should they be handled?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DancesWithBamboo replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2>Each of my projects has a "Reference" folder where I put all of my third-party components.&nbsp; Then it is checked into TFS with the rest of the code.&nbsp; So I think we use the same technique.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Fintanv replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2><P>I follow the practice of having a \lib sub-directory as part of the directory structure of my solution.&nbsp; In this sub-dir I have other directories that hold specific dlls such as the MS Ent Lib, the Infragistics controls, Nunit, Nant, Typemock, Csla, etc.&nbsp; All of these get incorporated into the svn repository so that my solution has all of the dependencies used to build it.&nbsp; This is of use when two years down the road you need to make a change to the application, and dont have to try to figure out where to get the old versions of the dlls.&nbsp; Since I work on validated systems these is not a minor issue.&nbsp; </P>
<P>When I make a reference to these dlls I do so to the lib path version.&nbsp; It is my understanding that if you have copies of the dll's in the GAC, then these are used first even if you reference the dll in a different location.&nbsp; This is only a problem if the dlls have the same assembly version, but different file versions, as then you are building your solution with the wrong dll.</P>
<P>Some may balk at the thought of storing all these extra bits in the repository, but experience has shown me that the pros outweigh the cons.&nbsp; Svn also does binary diffs so changes to the dlls are not painful in terms of wasteful space.&nbsp; I do not think vss does binary diffs (not sure of this though),&nbsp;so am not sure of the ramifications in your particular case.</P>
<P>Hope this helps,</P>

<P>I like the idea of a distinct folder.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jeff replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2>Definitely exclude bin/obj folders from source control. Here's what I do for each "application":<br><br>trunk - solution file goes here<br>trunk/build - build scripts. Also I point all my projects to a bin directory here instead of their own.<br>trunk/lib - 3rd party components to be distributed with the app (csla, ui libraries, etc)<br>trunk/src - contains a folder per .net project<br>trunk/tools - 3rd party components not distributed (mbunit, mocking stuff, etc.)<br><br>"trunk" would just be your project root. I'm following subversion recommended trunk/tags/branches folders to work on multiple versions of the same source.<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
