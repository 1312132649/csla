<P>Child : BusinessBase&lt;Child&gt;<BR>{ }<BR>Parent : BusinessBase&lt;Parent&gt;<BR>{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child _child;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Child<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ get return _child; }<BR>}</P>
<P>I'm assuming this is the standard move here. The problem that I'm having is that when I bind to a control like so</P>
<P>bindingSourceParent.DataSource = myParent;<BR>bindingSourceChild.DataSource = myParent.Child;</P>
<P>and then make a modification to the child (which in turn invalidates the child) when I show the broken rules for the parent, the child items are not included. Since IsValid has been overriden to check (_child.IsValid &amp;&amp; base.IsValid) do I need do something special to get all the broken rules of the children into the parent's collection?</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR>JB</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 30, 2006</h2><P>You are correct that the information doesn't flow up automatically.</P>
<P>Since the broken rules list is maintained on a per-property basis, how would you expect the broken rules to appear in the parent - collapsed so they all appear to belong to the Child property?</P>
<P>Given a more complex object graph, would you expect grandchild and great-grandchild entries to also be listed as part of the Child property (because the root object has no property for the grandchildren, etc)?</P>
<P>None of this would work with IDataErrorInfo - other than perhaps the Error property from that interface could list all the broken rules for all the objects in the graph. That could be highly misleading in a grid however, as the tooltip would list errors that couldn't be fixed by changing values in the visible cells. It seems to me that the user experience in such a scenario would be very odd.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
