<P><SPAN>Allan Nielsen and Dave Ricker has translated to VB and they are available for download at <A href="http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/cslavbtemplate">http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/cslavbtemplate</A></SPAN> </P>
<P>Kudos to both of you for both of you considering the number of codes (about 2000 lines) and templates need to be translated.</P>
<P>I do hope to benefit from this, as I would be receiving feedbacks from both VB and C# users.&nbsp; Specifically I would like to hear your feedbacks on the split class implementation.&nbsp; Since generics and partial class is fairly new to me, I would like to hear from anybody that has use&nbsp;this in real application if the implementation really work.</P>
