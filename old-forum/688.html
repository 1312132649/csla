<P>Storing in UT/GMT/Zulu time (or whatever it's called now) is the obvious solution.&nbsp; What isn't so obvious is how/where to do the conversion, since I want the users to see the time represented in their respective time zones.</P>
<P>My first thought is to decode the value to the local time zone during the fetch, and to reconvert it to Zulu during any inserts/updates.&nbsp; This seems to be the simplest solution with the least code impact.&nbsp; Just seems a tad inappropriate having the object handle what's basically a UI issue, though.</P>
<P>Have any of you had to deal with this, and if so, what was your approach?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RRorije replied on Friday, July 21, 2006</h2>I see your point&nbsp; and I have not dealt with it, but IMHO this is not a UI issue. It sounds to me the same as creating a property on a businessobject that combines first name and lastname to fullname. Which in my opinion should also reside on the businessobject.<br><br>I think you just have to add a readonly property to the businessobject that represents local time, based on the DateCreated/ LastModified. This can be done during Fetch, or just when adressing the property.<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 21, 2006</h2><P>It seems to me that Brad Abrams (a key guy on the .NET Framework team) blogged about this sort of thing a year or two ago. I don't have time to google it for you - but he (or someone on his team) did write a really nice article about formatting datetime values for time zones.</P>
<P>And as I recall, not all the answers were pretty... <img src="/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad [:(]" /></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
