I am generating the objects with CSLAGen and selecting the EnterpriseServices TransactionType. This adds a Transactional attribute to the dataportal methods. My question is why are the two saves not working as a transactions.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, April 17, 2009</h2>It sounds like you're trying to save two root objects.  By definition, they always complete within their own transaction.  You'll need to create a third BO, possibly a CommandBase subclass, which will have the attribute and call Save on each BO in its DataPortal_Execute method.  Search around on the forum, this has come up before.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, April 17, 2009</h2><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/SaveMultipleRootObjects.ashx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/SaveMultipleRootObjects.ashx</A></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
