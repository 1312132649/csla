<p>On my Windows 7 machine in the Development Web&nbsp;server, everything has been working fine.&nbsp; I used the same technique to install the dll on Windows Server 2008 Server (Install the dll, register it by running c:\Windows\SYSWOW64\regsvr32.exe).&nbsp; But on the server&nbsp;I keep getting the same dreaded error:</p>
<p>error: 80040154 Class not registered (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG))</p>
<p>My machine and Server have comparable OS.&nbsp; The difference is that locally I am using the Development Web, and it is IIS 7 on the server. Could it be that the IIS configuration has something to do with the error. When I try to read my 800 page IIS 7 book, my eyes glaze over.&nbsp; Seeing that so many smart people frequent this site, I though I&#39;ll post this question here.</p>
