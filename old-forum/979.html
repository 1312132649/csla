I'm not sure the problem is in AO (in fact I'm pretty sure it's not), because of a simple fact: It doesn't throw an exception, or fail or anything.<br><br>Here's the steps to reproduce:<br><br><ul><li>Set up an ActiveReadOnlyList (it doesn't need to load anything from the db, you can create dummy objects child objects).</li><li>Load it with remoting, and make sure that Notify("IsDirty", True) is called. You can either do this by hand or by not setting RaiseListChangedEvents to false when loading the list.</li><li>Wait for the object to return.</li><li>Ignore the previous step, it never happens.</li></ul>It's strange because I see that the objects are being serialized, so the list is loaded, I even see that it gets to return the object, but it never actually get's back to the client, and no, it doesn't throw an exception.<br><br>The worst part of all this story is that that line of code (notify...) doesn't actually do anything, because at that point no object is registered to the list.<br><br>I'm wondering if this could be one of those edge cases where you need to specify an attribute somewhere, like when someone found the inlining problem in PropertyHasChanged...<br><br>Seriously, this is the biggest wtf i've found so far in .net.<br><br>Andrés<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>eslater replied on Friday, May 02, 2008</h2>xal,<br><br>I am running into this issue now and am wondering if you solved the problem.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be great.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Elliot<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Saturday, May 03, 2008</h2>Hi Elliot,<br>Yes, I did fix this and a few other perf issues (this changes things dramatically performace wise, but the code you write would be the same). It's been about two years since I heard anything from Petar. I don't know what happened. I hope he's ok.<br>Anyway, I published the latest AO (meaning, Petar's + a few changes I made) in CslaGenerator's forum, under the files section. You can get the binaries or the source here:<br>http://groups.google.com/group/CslaGenerator/files<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>eslater replied on Monday, May 05, 2008</h2>xal,<br><br>Thanks for the link but when I attempt to use CSLA 3.5 I get 35 errors in the project.&nbsp; Is there something I am doing wrong or does it run against CSLA 2.x only?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Elliot<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>eslater replied on Monday, May 05, 2008</h2>Cancel that last msg.&nbsp; I hadnt changed the target framework.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
