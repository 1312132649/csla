<P>This completes the core video series. As we move into 2010 I plan to produce separate UI-specific videos covering WPF, ASP.NET MVC, etc, so watch for those.</P>
<P>If you haven't purchased the CSLA .NET Core 3.8 video series, there are only two days left of the special pre-release pricing. And only two days left for the holiday discount on the CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series.</P>
<P>So if you want to save 15 to 33% off regular pricing, <A href="http://store.lhotka.net">buy the video series before the end of 2009!</A></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MadGerbil replied on Wednesday, December 30, 2009</h2>I bought the videos.<br /><br />My only comment thus far is that you have a suprisingly low voice.  I thought developers were supposed to have a very high, squeaky voices.<br /><br />You're like the James Earl Jones of .NET.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
