<P>I imagine in a real app you'd prompt the user for their username/password and use the Csla.Security.MembershipIdentity to authenticate those values.</P>
<P>The code you are looking at is slightly more complex than it needs to be. You can actually create instances of MembershipIdentity directly if you don't need to customize the identity. I think I created a more basic demo in the CslaNet\cs folder, because I do cover this in the 2008 book.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
