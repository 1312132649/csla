As in newing up your object:<br /><br />Dim x = New MyMustInherit?<br /><br />If that's the case... that's expected.  You've created an abstract class, meaning it's now concidered only a partial implementation.  A subclass must be created instead (which doesn't have the MustInherit).  The factory method works by having something Newing the concrete class, but ONLY returning the abstract refernce... so you never know exactly which concerte type you'll get.  <br /><br />Does that help at all?</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
