In the mean time we need to ship our C# BO's exposed as a COM interface. If worst comes to worst I'll expose a COM visible interface and box/unbox my BO's properties/methods.</P>
<P>I don't want to use say a BuisnessListBase&lt;BuinesBase&gt; as a SafeArray[] on the COM client.</P>
<P>Has anyone used CSLA .NET with a COM client?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, December 17, 2007</h2><P>Personally what I try to do in these cases is to create a separate assembly that sits between the COM client and your real objects.</P>
<P>Client -&gt; COM assembly -&gt; business library</P>
<P>This helps avoid contaminating your real .NET business library with COM goo.</P>
<P>However, it does mean writing an assembly that has a lot of COM goo, and which acts as an intermediary between COM clients and your .NET objects - and that can take some effort.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
