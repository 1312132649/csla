While I realize that many online reviewers represent a more extreme view, I find that all the negative reviews surrounding the Kindle give me pause.&nbsp; Basically, they make it sound like if I have a problem with my Kindle, Amazon will do everything possible, short of stapling a note to my forehead, to say that the damage was my fault and thus not covered under warranty.&nbsp; I have even read a post where Amazon tried to blame the damage on the customer for a Kindle that *arrived from UPS broken*.<br /><br />2. The Kindle&#39;s reliance on Amazon&#39;s proprietary format is limiting.&nbsp; However, while the Nook supports more formats, I&#39;m not the type of person that likes to search high and low across multiple sites to find the book(s) I want.&nbsp; And there&#39;s no disupting that Amazon&#39;s installed book base is much higher than the Nook&#39;s.&nbsp; Plus, Amazon has developed reader applications for almost any device you might ever want to read Amazon e-books on (even an iPad!)<br /><br />3. This part is a little confusing, but at one point I read that a Kindle is something like an iPod/iTunes - if you get a new version, previously-downloaded books will not work with the new Kindle.&nbsp; Later information seems to refute that.&nbsp; There was also some question about recovering deleted books, but again, later information seems to show that works just fine.<br /><br />4. The Kindle has a couple usability issues with the keyboard on the larger version.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;d even get the larger version, and I&#39;m not expecting to write sonnets or anything on this.&nbsp; But it seems to be a real pain for many users.&nbsp; The Nook apparently does not suffer from such issues.<br /><br />5. I have heard decidedly mixed reviews of Kindle&#39;s PDF performance and usability, while the Nook seems to do quite well.&nbsp; Since Rocky has hung up his pen and paper for the world of e-content surrounding CSLA, this is a concern.&nbsp; (And that, lucky readers, is the only CSLA reference you&#39;re going to get in this post.&nbsp; I told you it was tenuous...)<br /><br />6. Neither e-reader contains something so incredibly basic that I still almost can&#39;t believe it - a way to organize books into some sort of folder structure.&nbsp; It&#39;s entirely likely that my wife and I will start out by sharing whatever device we get, and while I&#39;m not worried about hiding anything from her, the storage systems leave a lot to be desired.&nbsp; Add in that both devices apply a &quot;most recent&quot; organization structure on top, and somebody&#39;s going to be upset.<br /><br />Put this all together, and I&#39;m starting to think that finding space for some bookshelves is not such a bad idea...<br /><br />- Scott</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Thursday, August 19, 2010</h2><p>Scott,</p>
<p>As a recommendation, my answer is totally worthless.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do not own kindle, I have never seen it from close up (or even from a distance).&nbsp; But I love their commercials.&nbsp; So - I&#39;ll probably buy that - whenever!&nbsp; My son own an iPad.&nbsp; He let me hold it for a minute, once.&nbsp; I agree it&#39;s kind&#39;a pricey as a book reader.&nbsp; What&#39;s a Nook?&nbsp; Never heard of it.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t buy it until they rename it - sorry. BTW, are you even allowed to look at your co-worker&#39;s nook!&nbsp; And to call it bulky!!! Scott! <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p>
<p>Jav</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, August 21, 2010</h2><p>I own a Kindle - we have two actually, as my wife has one too.</p>
<p>We also have a library, since we&#39;re both bookworms. Yes, we have a room with bookshelves all around stacked with books (often double-stacked).</p>
<p>I can say that I never thought I&#39;d abandon books for any e-reader. Certainly I&#39;d never choose to read a book on a computer or iPad - the shiny screens are a non-starter.</p>
<p>The thing is, <a href="http://www.magenic.com/">Magenic</a> gives all employees a &quot;tech gift&quot; every holiday season, and a couple years ago the&nbsp;gift was a Kindle 2. So although I wouldn&#39;t have purchased one, I was presented with one so I gave it a try. What did I have to lose?</p>
<p>I read one book on it and loved the experience.&nbsp;I loaned it to my wife who read a book on it, and promptly&nbsp;informed me that a Kindle would be her next birthday gift :)</p>
<p>We&#39;ve purchased almost no paper books in the past two years. There&#39;s one author (Neal Asher) who&#39;s older books are just impossible to find, on Kindle or paper, and a friend in the UK was able to get me an actual book&nbsp;- and we&#39;ve purchased some study books for our kids (who don&#39;t have Kindle readers of course).</p>
<p>But I suspect our days of buying actual books is about done - the only exception being some of those hard to find science fiction books, or books we buy specifically to get signed by authors at sci fi conventions (yes, we&#39;re serious geeks).</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t recommend getting the big Kindle - unless it is a second device you use to read magazines or something. The beauty of the Kindle is that it is the perfect size and weight - much lighter than most of the books we tend to read - and the next/prev page buttons are exactly in the right position for one-handed reading.</p>
<p>In short, the Kindle makes it easier to read a book than an actual book.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried using an iPad - the shiny screen and weight make it a non-starter as an e-reader. I&#39;d go back to paper books first.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t tried a Nook, so perhaps it is comparable to the Kindle - but we now have quite a library of books on our Kindle account, so I&#39;m sure not interested in switching or having a second device...</p>

<p>Rocky,</p>
<p>After reading your comments I ran over to Amazon to buy one.&nbsp; I saw two being offered.&nbsp; A $139 one with Wi-Fi and a $189 one with Wi-Fi and free 3G.&nbsp; I was going to buy the latter, but then&nbsp;I recalled your comment about the &quot;big&quot; kindle.&nbsp; I am assuming you are referring to one that is bigger <strong>in size</strong> and not just in price.&nbsp; This one with 3G is the same 6 inch as the other one.&nbsp; I thought I should ask first.&nbsp; BTW, would I be able to transfer my Csla books to kindle, right now I am reading them on my computer screen&nbsp;(yeah - I know)</p>
<p>Jav</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 23, 2010</h2><p>By &quot;big&quot; I meant the larger physical size. It is physically too large/heavy to hold nicely, or to transport in my laptop bag like the normal Kindle.</p>
<p>Whether you get 3G or not should depend on how you plan to use the device. I have the older Kindle 2, so 3G was the only option, and I like it - I buy books from airports, hotel rooms, my home, etc.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m not entirely sure I&#39;d buy 3G now - I&#39;d probably be happy enough with Wi-Fi, knowing I need to shop when I can get online. Hard to say...</p>
<p>The CSLA ebooks (from my store at least) are PDF, and Kindle reads them. I find that I need to rotate the display 90 degrees to get the font large enough to read, which isn&#39;t ideal. </p>
<p>With the CSLA 4 ebooks my plan is to figure out a way (PDF or MOBI) to make the content fit better on the Kindle - which probably means different publishing formats - I&#39;ll have to see just how much work that turns out to be...</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Monday, August 23, 2010</h2><p>Thanks Rocky.&nbsp; While browsing around Amazon, I was a bit surprized that the most common software related books available for Kindle are the titles &quot;...

<p>This has been an outstanding question for me as well.&nbsp; Wi-Fi is awfully available these days, and while it&#39;s not all free, it may be prevalent enough for me to skip the 3G.&nbsp; However, is the knowledge that I can get books anywhere, anytime worth an extra $60?</p>

<p>This was actually going to be one of my questions.&nbsp; I was wondering whether you were investigating making your e-books available in the native Kindle AZW format.&nbsp; Given that they provide translation capabilities of PDF files for free, I&#39;m wondering just what&#39;s involved.&nbsp; Honestly, if you were to provide future CSLA e-books in a Kindle format, I&#39;d consider that a strong point to get one.&nbsp; <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" />&nbsp; I know the Kindle supports MOBI, but like PDF, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as good as its native format.</p>
