<P>I've read chapter 11 and implemented the credentials class to use in the soap header.&nbsp; We plan on using SSL to encrypt the username and password.&nbsp; Everything seems fine, but we didn't know what customers would think of passing their username and password for each web method.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We were thinking about writing a login web method that would return a security token.&nbsp; The consumer would pass the token in the soap header.&nbsp; We'd use the token to validate the user and load the principal. The token would expire after a period of time.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We didn't look much at WSE.&nbsp; Does the customer need to use .NET if we use WSE?&nbsp; We don't know what platforms our customers will be using and we cannot have .NET as a requirement.</P>
<P>So, what have other people done for web service authentication and security?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
