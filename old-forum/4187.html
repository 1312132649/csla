I first read your work in 2000 when I read "Professional Visual Basic 6 Business Objects" - in fact that was my first exposure to creating practical, OO code in VB. </P>
<P>Over the past&nbsp;9 years I have largely been involved in either developing small, procedural apps or&nbsp;working on other&nbsp;peoples' designs and had little say in architectural decisions. In many cases the business needs were so immediate that we simply had to get the code written and working and little thought was given to architecture. Now, I find myself in a position where I am a major contributor to architecure and design decisions&nbsp;in a project to design and develop an entire OO,&nbsp;n-tier web-based system. The first thing I did was to buy and start reading "Expert VB 2005 Business Objects".&nbsp;Since I learned OO coding from reading your books, the CSLA approach seems very natural and easy to me, but there is an unofficial policy in place here to go with SOA.&nbsp;This project is on a very tight timeline and is limited in scope so&nbsp;SOA is not REQUIRED, but I have been told that I SHOULD design the sysytem&nbsp;so it&nbsp;can easily be&nbsp;used by&nbsp;other SOA systems. Part of&nbsp;this is a requirement that EVERY business object must have an interface defined. In fact - it has been strongly recommended that ALL coding use interfaces (ie: UI code to instantiate a business object actually instantiates the Interface rather than the object itself: Dim Ent as IEntity = New Entity())</P>
<P>I have downloaded the CSLA.NET framework and browsed through it. It is rather complex but I can see how powerful and useful it can be.&nbsp;How can I reconcile the framework with the above mentioned requirements? Would I be better off to&nbsp;NOT use the framework but develop my own&nbsp;simplified framework using the same principles? There is much in the framework that will not be required by this project such as n-level undo and such. I still have not finished reading the book - I'm only on Chapter 2 - so if the answers to these questions are in there just point me in the right direction.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>

<P>And if you are using WCF, then the <EM>Using CSLA .NET 3.0</EM> ebook has a chapter with great information on using CSLA with WCF services (and on some aspects of WCF services in general).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rbibber replied on Thursday, January 17, 2008</h2><P>Thank you. I skipped ahead and scanned chapter 11. </P>
<P>We are not using WCF in this project but I do plan on reading that ebook regardless.</P>
