<P>But i'm just wondering as always. CSLA is 100% Model Driven Design.. i know</P>
<P>But does CSLA fit in with Domain Driven Design?</P>
<P>Evan already explained the differences, but that doesn't really isn't an answer.<BR><A href="http://www.domaindrivendesign.org/discussion/blog/evans_eric_ddd_and_mdd.html">http://www.domaindrivendesign.org/discussion/blog/evans_eric_ddd_and_mdd.html</A></P>
<P>Greetings,<BR>Raymond de Jong</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, December 16, 2008</h2>Hmm... from that link, it sounds to me like Csla is helping you do DDD.&nbsp; The user cases are the tasks the users must accomplish, and dictate how the system does that.&nbsp; We then code our objects around these use cases..<br><br>Maybe I'm missing something though, but given the examples in that link I'd say Csla is based around DDD, not MDD.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Wednesday, December 17, 2008</h2><P>The CSLA book 2.0 we have doesn't talk about "model driven" or "domain driven". On <A href="http://www.orbonyx.com/csla/">http://www.orbonyx.com/csla/</A>&nbsp;there is another link to <A href="http://www.orbonyx.com/csla/SignificantlysimplifiesModelDrivenDesign.html#Topic8">http://www.orbonyx.com/csla/SignificantlysimplifiesModelDrivenDesign.html#Topic8</A>&nbsp;which explains that CSLA significantly simplifies MDD. </P>
<P>On <A href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/80742/net-domain-driven-design-with-c#123551">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/80742/net-domain-driven-design-with-c#123551</A>&nbsp;there are some reply's about DDD and CSLA, but that's more about which book will go into details about the DDD theorie.</P>
<P>And i just found a blog from Derick Baileys, after reading it, it demotes me to continue with CSLA...<BR><A href="http://www.avocadosoftware.com/csblogs/dredge/archive/2007/02/19/687.aspx">http://www.avocadosoftware.com/csblogs/dredge/archive/2007/02/19/687.aspx</A></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, December 17, 2008</h2>Well, I don't know too much about DDD.&nbsp; From that last link though, I'm not sure if it's something new or a new name for data driven design.&nbsp; At any rate toward the bottom where the blogger answers four questions, his answers to #3 and 4 make me think that he doesn't really understand how to use Csla.&nbsp; Rocky has specifically addressed those concerns here as well.&nbsp; I disagree that Csla forces an active record pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're building BOs that simply wrap table access, you're doing Csla wrong.<br><br>Of course, no one claimed Csla is always the best fit and that it can solve every problem either.&nbsp; What I do know is that it works for me, and my application is much easier to maintain and has been scaling well so far.&nbsp; I'd be careful about getting too caught up in religous debates and "purity."<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Wednesday, December 17, 2008</h2>Most people are carefull in replying? Is there anyone using CSLA behind the DDD idea?<br /><br />DDD = Domain Driven Design.<br /><br />I know there are people totally in love with BDD (Behavior Driven Design) as a successor of TDD (Test Driven Design).<br /><br />We aren't doing any of those yet, not even doing an agile way. Yes.. waterfalling :)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rhoeting replied on Wednesday, December 17, 2008</h2>Scott Hanselman recently devoted a podcast to DDD,&nbsp; Rob Conery was his guest.&nbsp; Might be worth a listen.<br><br>Rob<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
