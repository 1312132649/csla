<P><BR>We have been watching the technology behind the Visual WebGui by Gizmox with some interest since last year.</P>
<P>The server side AJAX framework based on ASP.NET seem to provide security, scalability and performance.</P>
<P>In theroy used in CSLA, seems to be a perfect framework for enterprise applications.</P>
<P>However, the technology is a deviation from the standard Web application.</P>
<P>I would like to know Rocky's comments on this in general and specifically using this with CSLA</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>gonzalor_ar replied on Tuesday, July 22, 2008</h2>Hi kip,<br><br>I am doing my first steps with CSLA (wich I had a bit of experience) and Visual WebGui and the results are great. The development is pretty much like desktop development rather than web, you have to use Csla the same way.<br><br>See you<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kip replied on Wednesday, July 23, 2008</h2><P>Thanks very much for your post.</P>
<P>We are also considering it. However, we came across some issues.</P>
<P>Our application is&nbsp;already on ASP.NET 3.5. We were looking at 2 important issues which Visual WebGui does not have any workarounds which is kind of non-starter.</P>
<P>1. How to use the Site Map Provider for Menu.</P>
<P>2. APS.NET security integration. We have&nbsp;our own Security Module extension&nbsp;with CSLA to provide roles and role specific custom properties.</P>
<P>Both of these are not supported by Visual WebGui.</P>
<P>I would be most interested to know how you are tackling this in your app.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance</P>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi kip,<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><br><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>My name is Eyal Albert and i work in Gizmox the company behind Visual WebGui. I stumbled&nbsp; open your post.</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p><br></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For the first problem that you presented the reason that it canâ€™t
be done is that currently Visual <span>W</span>eb<span>G</span>ui
does not support hierarchical data source. Visual Web<span>G</span>ui reflect the API of .net WinForms 2.0 which also
does not support hierarchical data source.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We are planning to add this to our API with other abilities
that are not supported in WinForms in the near future.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">About The second issue that you presented a new issue was
open in our Issue tracking system and we will add support to this feature. You can view the issue <a href="http://support.visualwebgui.com/issue/ViewIssue.aspx?id=3486">here</a>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you very much for bringing this to our attention.<o:p></o:p></p>
