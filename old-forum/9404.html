<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>nelis replied on Tuesday, March 01, 2011</h2><p>I saw this one was fixed.</p>
<p>However, only the first&nbsp;culture requesting an instance of the business object is getting&nbsp;the proper&nbsp;property labels cached in FriendlyName...</p>
<p>I guess PropertyInfo should keep a Func to obtain the proper value</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, March 02, 2011</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have discussed changing the PropertyInfo to &quot;not&quot; set the PropertyInfo member variable for FriendlyName when running on Server (ExecutionLocation = Server) and always read the possibly translated friendly name from DisplayAttribute, unless it was specisifed as part of RegisterProperty. </p>
<p>There may be performance issues when running on client (and server) as this field may be called quite often by the business rule subsystem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>nelis replied on Wednesday, March 02, 2011</h2><p>That&#39;s the intended solution? I do not witness this in the source code of 4.1.0</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, March 02, 2011</h2><p>I didn&#39;t say that this is implemented.</p>
<p>It has been discussed as a possible solution, not concluded and not implemented. </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
