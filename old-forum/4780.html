<P>Thanks for any feedback.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Thursday, May 01, 2008</h2>We just have the DLL and PDB and it does not prohibit us from stepping into CSLA when debugging. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, May 01, 2008</h2><P>FYI.</P>
<P>Rocky has recommended several times that you should always build the CSLA.dll in a stand alone project and then just add it to your business app project. </P>
<P>If you include CSLA in your business app as a project then you are asking for trouble.</P>

I was just seeing if there is any reason not to do it that way.<BR><BR>Thanks again!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SouthSpawn replied on Thursday, May 01, 2008</h2><DIV>Joe,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For the sake of asking.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Why is it bad to add the actual project to your solution?<BR><BR>I have done this, and I haven't had any trouble at all.</DIV>
<DIV>I don't make any chances to the CSLA code, so nothing is really effected at all.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What am I not thinking of?<BR><BR>Thanks,<BR>Mark</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, May 02, 2008</h2><P>The primary issue you'll run into is with various controls. Many times if you change Csla.dll and are using controls (Windows, Web, WPF) you'll have to close and re-open VS (or at least your solution) to get the controls to load from the new assembly. This can cause some serious issues and destabilization of VS sometimes.</P>
<P>Additionally, it is just a best practice to treat external components as being, well, external.</P>
<P>Personally I always build Csla.dll (and any other external assemblies/controls) and put the assembly into a folder in my solution, and then I add that folder to source control. So the binary is in source control and my projects reference <EM>that</EM> binary.</P>
<P>Especially in a team setting this is good, because it requires a concious effort to change a library/component that is shared by everyone. Makes life a lot simpler!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
