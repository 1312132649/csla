<P>Performance will be your biggest concern but I think that's a WPF thing rather than any third party control.</P>
<P>I'd strongly recommend that you download trial versions and try binding and see how it performs - using a typical number of records and columns that you think your application will be using.</P>

Not to say it wasn't good ;-)<br /><br />My concern with installing a bunch of trial version is that I fear ruining my development machine. That's why I'd like to hear from others.<br /><br />So far I've read about the features of 4 different products: Infragistics, XCeed, DevExpress and Telerik.<br /><br />Regards</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, December 29, 2009</h2>I have a freebie (limited) Xceed grid, which I've had some limited use.&nbsp; Seems to work fairly easily.&nbsp; I've also used the Infragistics one a bit more, it also did the job, although I'm not too crazy about their support options (pay for bug fixes).</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lukky replied on Tuesday, December 29, 2009</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>ajj3085:</strong></div><div>I'm not too crazy about their support options (pay for bug fixes).</div></BLOCKQUOTE><br /><br />Yeah, that's exactly the kind of things I want to avoid. I mean, I really don't care paying for software, but I kind of pop a few vessels when I have to pay for bug fixes.<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Wednesday, December 30, 2009</h2><P>The Infragistics trial version is the full version so it won't ruin your development machine.&nbsp; </P>
<P>As for paying for bug fixes, well I got the service release 2 of the controls and all I needed to do was register my product serial number in the first place.</P>
<P>As Rocky as said, at the moment you really would benefit from choosing some third party WPF controls as the MS ones just aren't quite up to it yet, and so it's worth spending some time trialling them to see which one works best for your needs.</P>
<P>I hear some good things about Telerik's offerings.</P>
<P>My only complaint about WPF is performance on lower, or typcial spec. machines that&nbsp;are out there in our environment, and it's still very much a young technology - one step forward, two steps back but maybe I'm being a bit harsh.&nbsp; And maybe VS2010 will have better tooling and the WPF designer will actually be usable.</P>
<P>My experience is that&nbsp;CLSA code runs like lightining but then there is a visible delay as the WPF kicks into life.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
