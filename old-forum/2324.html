<P>AddNewCore, UniqueIDs, BindingSource....</P>
<P>I've also had some fun with canceling edits, validation of rows, multiple combo box columns, etc.&nbsp; Some of this is probably more about the DataGridView control then CSLA, but I bet most people end up using the control in their apps, and would benefit from sample code.</P>
<P>I'm going on Vacation next week, when I get back I'll try to post what I've been able to put together.&nbsp; If people think it's worthy, the community can use it.&nbsp; If anyone sees bugs, or knows better ways of doing things, I'd love to hear about it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sound good?</P>
