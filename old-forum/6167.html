I do remember seeing it from time to time while we created 3.6, but it was usually due to some other code issue that caused a compilation failure, and this was an erroneous message. I suspect Microsoft has some work to do in terms of how the build process incorporates XAML and C# together.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MTmace replied on Wednesday, February 04, 2009</h2>I am getting the same error. <br>I just installed .net 3.5 with service pack one so I can build the CSLA 3.6 framework and got a build error.<br>The tag 'BrokenRuleSeverityConverter' does not exist in XML namespace 'clr-namespace:Csla.Wpf'.<br>The error is occurring in Generic.xaml in the Themes directory.<br><br>I think the error may have to do with the fact the CSLA.dll files does not exist.
