<P>decribe a model of what needs to happen, describe the "things" and how they interact.</P>
<P>when you can draw some diagrams of this then start to look at what you need to save and get from the db.</P>
<P>for example are you managing "Property" as a "Single Family House" or "Comercial" or multiple types?</P>
<P>size of plot is (I think) an attribute of a plot of land - which may have other attributes</P>
<P>bedrooms are attributes of homes or hotels.</P>
<P>who is the user of the app?</P>
<P>what are they doing?</P>
<P>what is the business trying to do?</P>
<P>what is the process?</P>
<P>there may be several table structures that can work, but that should come after you can describe the logical objects the user will interact with.</P>
<P>OBject is not table</P>
<P>table is not object</P>
<P>but an object might use data in a table or many tables, or no table at all sometimes.</P>

I presume this is my setup ... that i need.... it would be good if you could comment if i am in the right direction<br><br>Login Object - main login object to hold userid and password<br>Permission Object - is related to Login Object and will hold the attributes i.e. "Can create new property", "Can edit new property etc" etc..<br><br>Property Object - to hold a property of multiple types i.e. a House, APartment, Hotel, Office etc<br><br>So thinking down the lines of "object", <br><br>I presume Login Object would be business BASe... but what about permissions object?<br><br>Basically its going to be a small app for allow the user to login, at login stage they will be certain permissions i.e. "can create property", "can edit property", and more in the future.<br><br>Then the user (depending on the permissions) will be able to Add a new property, Delete it, Edit it etc<br><br>Also the user will have another permission to allow to create additional users, delete users etc..<br><br>No really too difficult , its trying to understand how i adapt it to the CSLA framework.... I did look in the book at the sample app.... but still a little confused :-)<br><br>Any advise really appreciated<br><br>Thanks in advance<br><br>Ian<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
