It appears that the issue was with the hard drive. I discovered it was down this morning, and Magenic's IT group got it fixed, restored from backup and running again yet today. Which is darn nice, given that it is a weekend, and Magenic isn't really a hosting company <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
<P>But if you find that recent posts are mysteriously missing, the reason is that they were posted after the latest backup and so were lost. Sorry about that, but you all know how backups work and at least we only lost a few hours of posts and a few hours of uptime.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Wal972 replied on Sunday, June 25, 2006</h2><P>Great you had answered a post I had made and i had added another question could you please have a look at </P>
