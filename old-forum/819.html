<P>using spring, i can further decouple the dal from the core, and use configuration to inject my dependencies. plus, i'll admit that i'm lazy and haven't looked in a while, but i don't know of any other frameworks that implement aop (aspect oriented programming).</P>
<P>actually, spring and csla set out to accomplish entirely different goals. spring tries to minimize coupling by providing a configuration framework with which to glue together business objects, while csla standardizes CRUD, and enables business objects to enforce their business rules and functionality anywhere. however, i don't see the two&nbsp;visions as being diametrical.</P>
<P>any input?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>phucphlq replied on Tuesday, August 08, 2006</h2><P>I'm too. I am trying to use CSLA and Spring.Net. I think Spring help to implement Observer, Pooling and more while CSLA can't. Please help me if you can.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, August 09, 2006</h2>Its true that Csla doesn't help to implement observer patterns, but ActiveObjects is an extension library which will help you do this.&nbsp; I'm not familiar with Spring.Net, so I can't tell you how well it would work with Csla.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
