<p>All my other business objects are calling through my DAL to get their data and I can&#39;t seem to get my CslaIdentity class to work when I try to move it&#39;s fetch to the DAL.&nbsp; A working example might help me figure out what&#39;s going wrong.&nbsp; I&#39;m using CSLA 4.0 RC1 but any examples in the 3.x codebase should help.</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

It has a custom identity object that flows through the data portal. I don&#39;t remember if it subclasses CslaIdentity or not, but that shouldn&#39;t really matter - it is a mobile object regardless.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MichaelBBonner replied on Tuesday, July 20, 2010</h2><p>I didn&#39;t ask my question correctly, I&#39;m trying to implement ObjectFactory DAL methods for all my business objects and all of the examples I seem to find for CslaIdentity implementation seem to be using&nbsp;direct DataPortal_Fetch implementation rather than object factory ones.&nbsp; Both the rolodex and PTracker implment the fetch&#39;s inline with the business object definitions, rather than seperated into object factory calls.</p>
<p>Sorry for not being precise in my initial question, LOL it was perfectly clear in my head when I asked it.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 20, 2010</h2><p>You need to subclass CslaIdentity and apply the ObjectFactory attribute to your subclass so the data portal can pick up on it.</p>
<p>Or if we&#39;re talking CSLA 4, you&#39;d subclass CslaIdentityBase&lt;T&gt; so you get all the good RegisterProperty and strong typed goodness.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
