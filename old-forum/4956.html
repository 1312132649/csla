<P>I haven't&nbsp;coded with&nbsp;CSLA.NET or nHibernate but the features of both seem ideal for our new dev project.&nbsp; I have been searching the forums/codeplex and I'm unable to find a fully working example that utilses both of these in tandem. I would greatly appreciate a working sample if anyone has one or knows of one.</P>
<P>Many Thanks</P>

<P>I had downloaded that project previously, but it doesn't have a UI and I have&nbsp;tried to create one without success.&nbsp; I tried adding the PTWin&nbsp;UI project (from the csla download sample) and hooking it up to access the database(s)&nbsp;directly.&nbsp; This didn't work and I received a Data Portal Fetch failed exception.</P>
<P>DataPortal.Fetch failed (Could not compile the mapping document: (unknown)).</P>
<P>Now I'm pretty much stuck so any help/sample would be greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>Many thanks</P>
