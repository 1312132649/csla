(not sure what is the default is not specified) and the timeout elapsed
before the TX is completed, what happens is that actions made before
the timeout is rolled back but after that, the connection unbinds
itself from the transaction and if any action, places itself in
autocommit mode (just like a regular connection) and if actions are
made after the timeout (BUT still inside the TransactionScope, since
these were performed in autocommit mode, <font size="5"><b>they will not be rolled back</b></font>).

<P>Fortunately you can always tell the data portal to use EnterpriseServices transactions instead&nbsp;:)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vaidal replied on Monday, May 04, 2009</h2>Well, you can avoid this behaviour adding "<em>Transaction Binding</em> = Explicit Unbind" in the connection string.<br><br>We are testing it now...<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
