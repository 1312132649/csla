<P>I'm having an issue where I'm trying to serialize a Business Object that has a property that is a&nbsp;file (could be any kind of file {.txt, .doc, .pdf, etc}).&nbsp; I load the file as a Byte array and the property itself is of type byte().&nbsp; The only other property of this file is the file name. So I've got two properties, one of a String type and the other byte().&nbsp; </P>
<P>My problem is that the object won't serialize, or I should say it will serialize, but when I use the Binaryformatter.Deserialize it returns nothing?</P>
<P>Any thoughts, comments, suggestions will be most welcome.</P>
<P>Thanks for taking the time to read this.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2>Did you mark your class with the Serializable attribute?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Golfnut1969 replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2>Yes, it's got the serialization attribute.&nbsp;</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Golfnut1969 replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2>I found the issue.&nbsp; I assumed the problem was the Byte Array property type, but it was something much simpler.&nbsp; Thanks for your time.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2>What was the problem?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2><P>Not sure if you can serialize the file like that.&nbsp; What are you trying to do with the bytes at the other end?&nbsp; I'm guessing it doesn't know how to deserialize it back to a file.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2>OK you fixed it.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Golfnut1969 replied on Tuesday, August 12, 2008</h2><P>The file is kept as a byte array simply because this enables me to include a file in my object regardless of the type of file.&nbsp; I can then send it with the object anywhere&nbsp;I want and then restore it to a hard disk anywhere and simply name the new file with the correct extension and any name I want.</P>
