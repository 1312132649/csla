Everything is marked &lt;Serializable()&gt;.&nbsp; What mystifies me is that the original object binds fine but the clone raises exceptions during the grid binding process which leads me to the conclusion that serializing doesn't actually grab everything thats essential?&nbsp; <br><br>I have worked out a workaround for this at present but would really like to know why the clone is different.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Nicholas<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 18, 2006</h2><P>What is the exception?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
