<P>I&nbsp;was assuming the purpose of the IPropertyInfo interface is to allow developers to leverage the bridge pattern to change how a property info object behaves within the framework.&nbsp; This would be nice to have - but you can't really use it since the BusinessBase classes are expecting an instance of PropertyInfo and not the interface itself (and I can't cast my implementation of the interface to the default PropertyInfo class since I am not directly inheriting from it).</P>
<P>What I was trying to do is change how FriendlyName returns a value (use a resource file instead of a string value from the PropertyInfo class) - just changing to another implementation of the property info class - or a simple virtual method would do the trick, but no such luck.</P>
<P>Now I did see that there is a virtual method&nbsp;being called&nbsp;for&nbsp;GetFieldData in the defalut propertyinfo class - puting this back into my implementation would be a snap - just copy and paste from reflector and were done!&nbsp; Now we are ready to move forward with our stuff...</P>
<P>Would it be possible to change the Csla.BusinessBase Load/Read/Get property methods to use the interface instead of the default implementation of PropertyInfo? </P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>The extensibilty mechanism is to subclass PropertyInfo&lt;T&gt; with your own implementation. I hadn't made FriendlyName virtual, but I'll change that, since it does no harm and enables your scenario.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
