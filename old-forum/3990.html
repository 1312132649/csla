<P>I have just started maintaining code that uses parts of CSLA, having lost my copy of the book , I'm trying to understand the proper implemetaion details of marking a business oject as dirty though the dadbinding process. I would think that the default behavor of the binding mechinsim would handle setting the dirty flag to true, but as far as I can tell when I edit an object the flag is never being set.</P>

<P>Thank you,</P>

<P>This calls into the framework and sets IsDirty=True (among other things.)</P>
<P>In older versions of CSLA it was a different style - but same idea.</P>
