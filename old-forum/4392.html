<P>Please read the change log prior to installing/using this release. If you are coming from version 3.0 or lower there are a few potential breaking changes. If you are coming from 3.5 Beta 1 there is one potential breaking change.</P>
<P>There are numerous bug fixes and feature tweaks from Beta 1 to Beta 2. These are thanks to the great feedback and help I've recieved from numerous people on the CSLA forum (<A>http://forums.lhotka.net</A>) - thank you all for your help!!!</P>
<P>I am excited to release Beta 2, because we're narrowing in on a final release of version 3.5 and any changes now will be bug fixes or stabilization. Any testing you can do on this new release is appreciated and will help ensure high quality in the final release.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>webjedi replied on Friday, February 22, 2008</h2><P>Excellent news Rocky, just the news I needed today.&nbsp; </P>

<P>It is relatively easy to serialize an object's properties into another format (xml, json or whatever). <EM>Deserializing</EM> data back into objects is hard. Very hard. Deserializing into a single object isn't so bad, but as soon as you have an object graph, especially if you allow circular or multiple references within the graph, it is really hard.</P>
<P>So I can't recommend writing your own serializer/formatter. But if you do go down that road I wish you the best of luck!</P>

<P>I have no plans to merge Enterprise Library into CSLA. I'm not sure the licenses would be compatible for one thing, and for another I don't want to take a dependency on something that not only isn't a Microsoft product, but isn't even guaranteed to be supported, maintained or enhanced going forward into the future. That's a risk I'm unwilling to accept for CSLA.</P>

<P>You mean the timezone on this forum? If your zone isn't listed you should probably go lobby the CommunityServer people on their forum. I just use their software, I don't have any control over what timezones, languages or other features are in the software.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Friday, February 29, 2008</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>As an FYI - </P>
<P>I have just installed VS 2008.&nbsp;I copied my large web app and upgraded it to use VS 2008 using CSLA 2.x still. (I had to overcome a side issue with an older 3rd party .dll.) But now that I have everything converted I ran the app and it worked as expected.</P>
<P>So I compiled the Beta and tossed it in to my app and re-compiled - I got&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;compile errors.</P>
<P>5 of them are due to the spelling change of AddDependantProperty to AddDependentProperty.</P>
<P>30 of them are for a Namespace collision between System.Reflection and CSLA.Reflection. It turns out I have a lot of places in my code where I use "Reflection.PropertyInfo". I think the fix is simple enough - just remove the "Reflection." from the code.</P>
<P>I had to remove the reference and add it back and then I got a clean compile! </P>
<P>I thought that I would have had some issues since I missed 3.0.x. I will have to review things closer in the future but for now I am happy to get it running.</P>

That's good, because in my code that's the hardest thing to overcome.</P>
<P>I rarely use reflection in my business object code, so the Reflection namespace collision hasn't been an issue.</P>
<P>I have run into the AddDependentProperty change, but that's fixed with ctl-shift-H (replace in all files).</P>
<P>But I habitually used the now-obsolete overloads of the CanXYZProperty methods, and so I've had to rework all my property declarations - and <EM>that</EM> ends up being a lot of work...</P>
<P>The easiest solution is to use snippets to just recreate the properties. And to use the private backing field option rather than the managed field option - because that avoids having to rework the data access code that interacts directly with the fields.</P>
<P>Though for new code I am using the managed field option, because that's even less code in the end.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, March 03, 2008</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>

<P>I avoided that can of worms from Day 1. </P>
<P>I never liked it and am glad you deprecated it.</P>
<P>Since I use Codesmith to Generate Properties, the extra work and use of string literals was never really an issue for me.</P>
<P>I could not play with the Beta before because I could not install VS 2008 until we fixed the 3rd party .dll problem (which we didn't know was the source of our trouble until....&nbsp; you get the idea.)</P>
<P>I would like to take a look at the new Property declarations. I am not sure if we will just stick with the original style or not. Again since they are code generated they are not much of an issue. We will have to weigh the benefits of making such a move.</P>
