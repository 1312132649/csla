Are you using the Asynchronous dataloading features of the control?<br /><br />We are looking to purchase this set of tools for paging, filtering, and sorting data passed via CSLA SL. We want to get a feel for if it works with CSLA SL.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Gareth.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Friday, September 04, 2009</h2><P>I can tell you that we are using it.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; We are dabbling a bit with different UI approaches and I don't believe we have tried any of the built-in asynchronous stuff - yet.&nbsp; Aside from that, all of the controls from Telerik seem to work great and we are loving how easy it is to implement a nice set of common features like docking, multiple pages and popup windows/dialogs.</P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I
have been using them for 1-2 months.&nbsp; They have issues, but overall
controls are good.&nbsp; We have been working with them on EditState bugs for
sometimes now, they supposedly fixed part of the issues, but we found one more
that the4y are working on now.&nbsp; As a workaround, we have to flag items
that are edited in grid with IDisableEditableObject = true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've had mixed success - their documentation is lousy, the
comboBox control is horrendous, especially in a grid, but their support is
quite good, if you can wait the 24 hour turnaround for a response.&nbsp; They
put a lot of effort into giving you samples or mockup projects.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I still get issues though with EditState from a few of their controls when
embedded in gridviews.<br>
