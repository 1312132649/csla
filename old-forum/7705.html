My project runs fine on my local machine using the development Web server, however when I deploy it to IIS on a server it failes to authenticate. The method I am using to authenticate is unchanged from the Rolodex original. Currently as a test  I have slugged the code so that it does not check for a valid used and commented out all of the authentication rules in my object so that I have full functionality (apart from authentication). Like I said this is my first Silverlight project - I would appreciate some guidance.<br />thanks<br /><br />Paul</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sergeyb replied on Wednesday, September 30, 2009</h2>Chances are you need to change ServiceReference.ClientConfig inside XAP application file.  You would possibly also need to put ClientAccessPolicy.xml at the root of the web site that hosts WCF service to address rights issue.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sergey Barskiy<br />Principal Consultant<br />office: 678.405.0687 | mobile:&#160;404.388.1899<br /><br />Microsoft Worldwide Partner of the Year | Custom Development Solutions, Technical Innovation<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: papa [mailto:cslanet@lhotka.net] <br />Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2009 8:06 AM<br />To: Sergey Barskiy<br />Subject: [CSLA .NET] Deployed Silverlight app wont authenticate user<br /><br />Hi<br />Like some others I am using the Rolodex sample as the base for my first Silverlight project.

I had updated the clientConfig.<br /><br />Thanks again, I would never have worked that out without your help.<br /><br />Paul</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
