I am using a hashtable to do some caching on the client side, but this requires me to use a clone of the object and ERLB is not cloneable. I basically write the&nbsp;object to the hashtable on the fetch, using the criteria and object type as a key. Before fetching new data I check the cache, and return a clone if it is found. Otherwise, I make my dataportal call, added it the hashtable, and return a clone. This obviously cannot work for ERLB objects.&nbsp;</P>
<P>In any case I would be interested in seeing if anyone has implemented ICloneable in the ERLB. </P>
<P>I would also be interested on your thoughts related to caching.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>I chose to just implement the&nbsp;Clone function found in in ObjectCloner. So, instead of calling the Clone method on the object, I just pass the object to the Public shared clone function before return in from the cache. This eliminated the need to implement the ICloneable interface on the ERLB.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
