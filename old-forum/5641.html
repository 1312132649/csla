<P>On a&nbsp;related note, can you still use "pseudo" property names in validation rules if you are using managed properties? (e.g. the property doesn't have to really exist -- you can call PropertyHasChanged() for a non-existent property and fire validation rules.)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, October 21, 2008</h2><P>Based on my reading of prior comments I say the answer is Yes to all questions.</P>
