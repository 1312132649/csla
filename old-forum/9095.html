For now, I downloaded CSLA 3.6.2 sample ProjectTracker application and I noticed that there is a file called ProjectList.Server.cs.</p>
<p>The book does not explain why there&nbsp;are two&nbsp;separate files ProjectList.cs and ProjectList.Server.cs in the ProjectTracker.Library project. Can someone tell me why?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

That&#39;ll probably happen eventually, but I obviously didn&#39;t get real far in the 3.6 timeframe...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
