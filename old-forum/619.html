Maybe this question has come up before, but I haven't found the solution yet. I would like to know how you handle this.<br><br>During the application I set the global context, <br><br><font face="Courier New">ApplicationContext.GlobalContext.Add(GlobalData.NAME, appData)</font><br><br>with some properties I need to have on both sides of the program. But it seems that the server will not remember these. Especially when I create a new thread on the dataportal, all the information seems lost. <br><br>I have not found a way around, to ensure that the properties are allways known at the server side.<br><br>I hope you can help me.<br><br>P.S. The version of CSLA that I use, (might be helpful) is 1.5<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, July 14, 2006</h2>Ahh, you're using threads.<br><br>The problem is that the GlobalContext stores its information in ThreadLocalStorage, so that when you create a new thread, it doesn't have this data (ThreadLocalStorage is private to each thread).<br><br>The ClientContext IS accessable from all threads, but don't 'refresh' with data from the data portal automatically.&nbsp; <br><br>This is just a limitation of threads and Csla.<br><br>See <a HREF="/forums/thread/908.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/908.aspx</a> for more information.<br><br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RRorije replied on Friday, July 14, 2006</h2>Thank you very much I will look into it.<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
