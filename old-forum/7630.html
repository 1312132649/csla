Used it some years ago and great product with developer only license - royaltyfree distribution. <br><h2>Easy-to-Use End-User Reporting Tools</h2>
						<div class="content"><p>ActiveReports
allows you to host the report designer in your application and
distribute it royalty free. It also allows end-users to edit reports
and to save and load report layouts. In addition, it allows you to
monitor and control the design environment and customize the report's
look and feel to meet the needs of your end users.</p></div><br>/jonnybee<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tom_W replied on Wednesday, September 16, 2009</h2>Hi Both<br><br>Many thanks, should have said this is for Winforms.<br><br>I had a look at the Aspose control, but the VB.Net version doesn't support querying multiple tables (or in our case multiple collections).<br><br>I had a look at ActiveReports but I couldn't see a query builder tool.<br><br>I'm wondering if I may be better getting the ReadOnly list classes to output a datatable/dataset version of their contents and then using these as the basis of the queries.&nbsp; That might open up the option of a few more controls.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>activescott replied on Thursday, September 24, 2009</h2>With ActiveReports we don't include a query builder for objects. However, ActiveReports does allow binding directly to object/IList based datasources with it's IListDataSource. When you install ActiveReports a sample named IList Binding. A more complete description of the samples are available in a readme.html file within the sample folder. You can find more information about using ActiveReports in a completely "unbound mode" at <a href="http://www.datadynamics.com/Help/ActiveReports6/arWLKGroupOnUnboundFields.html">http://www.datadynamics.com/Help/ActiveReports6/arWLKGroupOnUnboundFields.html</a>&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Our Data Dynamics Reports product may also be interesting to you. It also doesn't include a query builder feature exactly, but you -the developer- can define the fields available in the underlying object data source at design time (see <a href="http://www.datadynamics.com/Help/ddReports/ddrdconDatasetFieldsTab.html">http://www.datadynamics.com/Help/ddReports/ddrdconDatasetFieldsTab.html</a>for more information). Then you're end users can select which fields appear in the report using the built-in UI as shown in the following two links: <a href="http://www.datadynamics.com/Help/ddReports/ddrconFieldSelection.html">http://www.datadynamics.com/Help/ddReports/ddrconFieldSelection.html</a>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For information on getting the data into the report see the "Object Provider" section at the following link:

I'd suggest you load your data into a DataSet or you can setup a hierarchy in your classes so that you can use the nested property syntax for referencing nested objects in properties of the outer object as shown in the example column of the following page: http://www.datadynamics.com/Help/ddReports/ddrdconDatasetFieldsTab.html<br /><br />On the other hand maybe a sophisticated query builder (or a custom one) is more appropriate for your needs.<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
