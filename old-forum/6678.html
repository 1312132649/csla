Does any of the new csla frameworks include support for this type of authorization ?<br /><br />My current solution is : I have a CanImportCustomer() method which returns a boolean accordingly.<br /><br />Thanks</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, March 26, 2009</h2>Yes, there's the CanExecuteMethod() method, that you can call at the top of the method you want to protect. And when you set up your authz rules, you use AllowExecute() and DenyExecute() to specify the roles that can/can't execute that method.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
