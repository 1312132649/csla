In the code it looks like there is a check for a custom filter provider but without anyway to set that provider (that I can see). My situation:<br><br>binding list of (ContactItems)<br><br>properties that I need to filter on:<br>Inactive (true, false)<br>Type (Disqualified, Lead, Prospect)<br><br>I have two checkboxes - Include Inactive (if not checked then we filter inactive)<br>and Include Disqualified (if not checked then we filter contacts whose type is "Disqualified")<br><br>both may or may not be checked.<br><br>TIA<br><br>Dean.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 07, 2006</h2>Well that appears to be a pretty major oversight... <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /><br><br>This is exactly why I encourage people to try out the new code/concepts - because sometimes I just plain miss the obvious...<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dean replied on Monday, August 07, 2006</h2>So far other than that it is working real well.<br><br>BTW - I am amazed at how thin I can make my windows UI code with the new framework (and I suspect my evolving abilities with CSLA/mutli tier design). It is as close to fun as work gets :)<br><br>Dean<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, August 07, 2006</h2>Well I'm glad to hear that!! <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /><br><br>I have now added both a ctor overload and a property to allow setting of the filter provider delegate. The changes are in cvs for both VB and C#.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
