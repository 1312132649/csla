<P>CompanyList&nbsp;- ReadOnlyList<BR>--&gt;CompanyListItem - ReadOnlyChild<BR>----&gt;DivisionList - ReadOnlyChildList<BR>------&gt;DivisionListItem - ReadOnlyChild<BR>---------&gt;DepartmentList - ReadOnlyChildList<BR>------------&gt;DepartmentListItem - ReadOnlyChild</P>
<P>I have an Editible Root&nbsp;called Emploee which is assigned a Company, Division, and Department.</P>
<P>I have a WinForm that is bound to the Employee object.&nbsp; This form contains three dropdown boxes Company, Division, and Department.</P>
<P>The Company ComboBox is bound to the CompanyList, and&nbsp;the datasource is set&nbsp;during the FormLoad event.</P>
<P>The DivisionList is bound to the DivisionList property of the CompanyListBidingSource, and Department is bound to the DepartmentList property of the DivisionListBindingSource.</P>
<P>When the form is opened with the Employee object and&nbsp;the Company combobox contins the company list and the corroect value is selected. However,&nbsp;while the Division&nbsp;comobox is populated with the appropriate values for the selected company, the correct division is not selected.&nbsp; The first item in the list is selected.&nbsp; The same is also true for the Deparment list.</P>
<P>I know the databinding is working, and the objects are loading properly from the database, and if I make changes to the selected values they are saved to the database.</P>
<P>I just cant figure out how to make the correct Select Value disply on the two child combo boxes.&nbsp; Thanks for any guidance you can give.</P>
