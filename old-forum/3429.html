<P>I am required to design an 'Account' object which should hold several child collection objects as per the following tree:</P>
<P>Account<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PhoneNumbers<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PhoneNumber<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addresses<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Address<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoices<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoice<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders</P>
<P>Please advise on where should db setting and retrieving methods can be implement;&nbsp;is it suitable to implement those methods in collection objects&nbsp;(Collection saves/retrieves child objects) or in child objects (You have to invoke the save/retrieve method on each object)?</P>
<P>Provide with samples if available.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Monday, August 27, 2007</h2><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Cinnezo,<br><br>I'd take a look at the ProjectTracker sample project, provide with CSLA as this is a good example of where the CRUD methods are called for both root and children objects.<br><br>I also suggest doing some more research on the forums, as there are several examples of similar patterns.<br><br><a HREF="/forums/thread/13379.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/13379.aspx</a><br><br><a HREF="/forums/thread/1612.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/1612.aspx</a><br><br>If you are planning to work with CSLA on a regular basis, I can't recommend any better resource than the BusinessObjects book <br><br></font></font></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
