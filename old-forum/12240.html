<p>The underlying problem is that some uses of generics require runtime code generation by the .NET runtime. This isn&#39;t allowed in iOS and so Xamarin can&#39;t support those features of C#. Sadly CSLA uses a lot of generics and does use the specific generics feature that is disallowed.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
