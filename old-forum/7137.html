Which is why ***the MobileFormatter doesnâ€™t support circular references***." (Emphasis mine)<br /><br />I was running my application and a CslaDataProvider wasn't honoring IsInitialLoadEnabled it appeared. Trying to refresh the CslaDataProvider through code would exhibit the problem of just making my Silverlight app crash without contextual help.<br /><br />Attempting to hit this from within the debugger would cause debugging to just stop (no errors shown) and the window to close. Attempting to hit this from outside the debugger will crash your browser with no helpful information. <br /><br />My problem was that I had a circular reference that was attempting to get serialized. Debugging Silverlight is a pain at times. (There should almost be a translation dictionary of unhelpful behavior/weird AG_ messages to English!)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, June 19, 2009</h2>Here's a question...<br /><br />why would calling the factory method directly in an asynch fashion from Silverlight work with circular references: <br />            Combined.GetCombined(_combinedIdLookup.CombinedId, CombinedRetrieved);<br />            <br />while using the CslaDataProvider it does not work... (this gives me the nasty behavior described in the initial post)<br />            CslaDataProvider provider = Resources["CombinedDataProvider"] as CslaDataProvider;<br />            provider.FactoryParameters.Clear();<br />            provider.FactoryParameters.Add(_combinedIdLookup.CombinedId);<br />            provider.Refresh();</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
