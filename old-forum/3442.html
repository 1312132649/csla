But I <EM>really</EM> discourage doing that. This makes version management almost impossible.</P>
<P>You should (imo) treat Csla.dll like a 3rd party binary (even though you build it) and so you should reference the DLL, not the project. But then to get the controls to appear in the toolbox, you must right-click and Choose Items to get the controls into the toolbox.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>strick9 replied on Wednesday, August 29, 2007</h2>That's what happened.&nbsp; I started using the DLL.&nbsp; Thank again.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
