<p class="MsoNormal">Can we please get the FAQ sticky back.<span>&nbsp; </span>This sticky improved the forum greatly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Can we also have an additional sticky that
would be labeled FAQ sticky suggestions.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>This thread would allow users to
suggest what additional content should be added to the FAQ sticky.<span><br>

We might have to re-post it or something, it must be a bug in the forum software.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, December 04, 2006</h2><P>Yup, whether bug or by design, what's happened is that the post has gotten old enough that CS won't show it by default.</P>
<P>So now we're left with a choice.</P>
<P>We can repost the FAQ every few months - as a new post so it stays visible.</P>
<P>Or we can create a new forum for the FAQ and related FAQ discussion. That worries me, as it would likely siphon off discussion from the main forum and cause confusion...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Tuesday, December 05, 2006</h2>...or we could update the CSLA wiki...<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>malloc1024 replied on Tuesday, December 05, 2006</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">From what I have read, there should be a way to set the length
that a sticky stays on top.<span>&nbsp; </span>There should
be a dropdown box that displays 3 months, 2 months etc. for each sticky.<span>&nbsp; </span>This will determine how long the sticky
remains on top.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am not sure how to
keep the sticky on top when it about to expire.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps resetting that dropdown box back to 3 months would work.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have visited other community server forums
that are able to keep the sticky threads on top so it shouldnâ€™t be too difficult.<span>&nbsp; </span>Creating a new forum for the FAQ would cause
too much confusion. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ajj3085,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It is my understating that you have rights to make changes
to the FAQ sticky.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am wondering if
you could check to see if you can find that dropdown box that I mentioned in
the previous paragraph and reset it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Try
to play around with some of the settings to get that FAQ back on top.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, December 11, 2006</h2><P>I did/do have the FAQ post set as an "Announcement" which should make it permanently sticky. That isn't working. I have now created a new FAQ post, which is also an "Announcement", so I guess we'll see how long that lasts...</P>
<P>There is not a way to create an "Announcement" that allows replies - so I can't create a permanently sticky thread that allows replies.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>malloc1024 replied on Tuesday, December 12, 2006</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks, the FAQ sticky will be very helpful.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, if it does go
down again, it might not be worth the hassle of re-posting it.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
