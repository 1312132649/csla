<p>Then when the parent calls FieldManager.UpdateChildren (or explicitly saves each child), it passes a reference to itself as&nbsp;a parameter. This way the child objects have a reference to the parent while they are being saved, and the parent object has a valid Id property.</p>
<p>This is documented in the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net">Using CSLA 4: Data Access</a> ebook.</p>
<p>Also, the ProjectTracker code in svn (not yet in the Samples download) uses this technique when saving ProjectEdit or ResourceEdit objects.<br /><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslacvs/viewvc.cgi/core/trunk/Samples/NET/cs/ProjectTracker/">http://www.lhotka.net/cslacvs/viewvc.cgi/core/trunk/Samples/NET/cs/ProjectTracker/</a></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
