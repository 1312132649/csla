When i try call Customer.Save() the whole orcas beta 2 environment crashes and restarts. This happens at design time not run time... </P>
<P>I think there might be something wrong with my install, so i am going to try uninstall and resinstall oracs beta 2. I&nbsp;was just wondering if any one else has experienced a similar problem. I have searched on google&nbsp;and have not come across anything yet.</P>
<P>Does any one have any idea?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, August 05, 2007</h2><P>I haven't seen anything like this. I've used local, Remoting and WCF data portal configurations under beta 2 with no problems.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
