I have hundred of tables and hand-coding each one will take me years..\<img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /><br><br>I have tried using those designed for Easy Objects, but have been having problems getting the timestamp columns just right.<br><br>Could someone recommend a set of templates that might be suitable (either for CodeSmith or MyGeneration).<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br><br>Bonio<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Bonio replied on Saturday, July 08, 2006</h2>In response to my own question <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />, I have been playing around with MyGeneration templates to<br>see if I could get what I needed.<br><br>Attached is my first effort, based on the Doodads template code and altered to match Rocky's SP structure in his book (especially the timestamp feature).<br><br>This is a bit of a 'bodge' coding, but I have managed to now successfully generate my CSLA.Net SPs.<br><br>Comments/amendments gratefully accepted.<br><br>Bonio<br><br>P.S. the template is a .vbgen file created in the latest version of MyGeneration v.1.1.6.0 - link to this software (freeware) : http://www.mygenerationsoftware.com/portal/default.aspx<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>harmar replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2>while reading the book i also had the idea of fumbling around with the doodads template to generate all the stored procs for the ptracker db (it works for other db's too).<br>because timetable columns are already treated the way i like it i didn't change that. but because i like the way the procs are named in the book i added this naming convention to the template (it only works for english names and can be unchecked). so a table named 'Employees' generates to: addEmployee, existsEmployee, ...<br>this template does the job for me ;-)<br><br>regards<br>harmar<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>figuerres replied on Thursday, September 07, 2006</h2><P>I have not looked at the one you used but FWIW I have started using CodeSmith and so far I have generated about 20-30K lines of VB.Net and TSQL with it.</P>
<P>very good ! easy to understand, and looks like it can create text for just about anything, just make a template.</P>
<P>not free but I can see that just in 2 weeks it's created code that by hand would have taken months to key in and test. and as I tune the templates each time I use them it's better output with less manual tweaking!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, September 08, 2006</h2><P>FWIW, you can download CodeSmith 2.6 for free, which does allow the capacity to use the C# codesmith templates. </P>
<P>The creator of the templates did an absolutely marvelous job. </P>
