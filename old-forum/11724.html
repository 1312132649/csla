These new dll give me trouble with databinding to the collection which inherit from CSLAReadOnlyBase. When running on the old framework all works fine, but on the new the MS.Internal.Data.ViewManager.CacheView(Object collection, CollectionViewSource cvs, CollectionView cv, ViewRecord vr) throws a nullpointer exception on databinding (sometimes it works, sometimes it fails). I was wondering if this is a know issue in CSLA 4.1 or that it is a unkown databinding problem at microsoft. <span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"><span style="font-family:Consolas;color:#2b91af;font-size:x-small;"></span></span></span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 27, 2012</h2><p>I don&#39;t know, as I have made no effort to test version 4.1 on .NET 4.5.</p>
<p>We created CSLA 4.5 to support .NET 4.5 and 4.0.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough though, I don&#39;t think we changed anything in ReadOnlyBase to deal with changes in .NET 4.5 like you describe.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ptr replied on Wednesday, November 28, 2012</h2><p>I have the issue under investigation at microsoft, if they have a solution/cause for the errors I get I&#39;ll post more information. Thx for your thoughts Rocky.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ptr replied on Monday, June 24, 2013</h2><p>The problem was a faulty gethashcode implementation. Nothing wrong in de csla code.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
