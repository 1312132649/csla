However, the parent's BrokenRulesCollection is still empty. Is there a way to get a full set of broken rules, including the rules that are broken on the child objects? Or do I need to recursively walk the parent/child tree in order to find out why a given object is invalid?<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, November 25, 2008</h2><P>You have to recursively walk the tree.</P>

I'm doing something similar by recursively calling a "GetFullBrokenRulesCollection" that I implement on my base classes that inherit from CSLA.<br /><br />However, it seems that this is something that CSLA should provide in order to be consistent with the new behavior of IsValid.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
