I know large lists need to be avoided, but I figured just for kicks I'd look into it. I came accross this on msdn and ran the sample app, looked like it works pretty good and was wondering if anyone had any sucess with it. Thanks!<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
