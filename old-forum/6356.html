<P>Again, just a thought.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>James Thomas replied on Tuesday, February 17, 2009</h2>Yes - I was thinking the same thing. Activity levels are already too high in the general discussion forum for posts to survive on the first page for long and I can only see Silverlight questions growing more and more quickly. CSLA for Silverlight is a great way into developing well structured applications on this new platform, so I'm sure there will be many more new users (like me).<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
