<DIV>I put a break point there, and it doesn't even call the events.</DIV>

<DIV>The fetch is working fine.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JohnB replied on Friday, February 08, 2008</h2>Kind of tough without seeing any code. Are you sure that your properties are getting updated when&nbsp; changed and have you checked IsSavable after editing a datafield?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>praevsky replied on Friday, February 08, 2008</h2>Can't you "Attach to Process?".&nbsp; <br>If you don't hit the first line in Csla DataSource_InsertObject or Csla DataSource_UpdateObject, maybe you haven't made any changes?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SouthSpawn replied on Friday, February 08, 2008</h2><DIV>I am running this off of my local server, so there is no need to attach it to process in order to debug it.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JohnB replied on Friday, February 08, 2008</h2>Once you edit a field and click 'Save', how far can you get while debugging?

successfully? I would give that a try too. It does not take to long.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SouthSpawn replied on Friday, February 08, 2008</h2><DIV>I can set the properties in my parent and child objects.</DIV>

<DIV>When I click on the Save Button, it does nothing.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sceptical replied on Friday, February 08, 2008</h2>Have you tried to run a Sql Trace on it to see if the sql statement is running?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, February 08, 2008</h2><P>Hi Mark,</P>
<P>One suggestion I would have is to place a breakpoint right at save and just hop through it. You'll notice, for instance, if maybe your binding isn't happening properly and your object doesn't become dirty -- or maybe you have child objects that are dirty but the parent isn't dirty because you forgot to override IsDirty to say base.IsDirty || _childCollection.IsDirty..</P>
<P>Another thing is, are you sure you're set up right to be able to hit breakpoints? Put a "throw exception" in the dataportal methods just to be sure -- if you're not and it croaks all of a sudden, well, maybe it's getting there and you don't know it. </P>
<P>Just a few ideas...</P>
