<p>CSLA has fairly straightfoward requirements. If the server allows you to run ASP.NET code and to expose a WCF endpoint, then the data portal should work just fine.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Thursday, September 20, 2012</h2><p>Thanks.&nbsp; FWIW - I received a reply in the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazuredevelopment/thread/2e2ceb38-438f-49b3-b744-0b656df4db35/">Azure dev forum</a> this morning that running a WCF service in one of the free Azure <span style="text-decoration:underline;">web</span> sites (I didn&#39;t ask about <em>mobile</em> sites) may not be possible.&nbsp; The poster wasn&#39;t sure, but he mentioned the following:&nbsp; </p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">&quot;One workaround for this may be to look at [using] the Web API functionality to implement REST based services.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, this&nbsp;person&nbsp;stated that you could not&nbsp;run in full trust mode (again, in the web site...not sure about mobile site).&nbsp; Not sure if that is a problem for WCF services in general.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 20, 2012</h2><p>A couple ideas then.</p>
<p>First, I _think_ that CSLA 4.5&nbsp;can now run in partial trust as long as you switch the serializer to MobileFormatter. The primary issue with full trust is due to WCF and serialization.</p>
<p>Second, I do plan (at some point) to create a Web API data portal channel. You can do that now if you&#39;d like - adding a data portal channel doesn&#39;t require changes to CSLA at all, because the whole proxy/host model uses a provider pattern (see the &#39;Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration&#39; book).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
