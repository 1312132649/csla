I've used this model several times before.  I have one form where it doesn't work.  I'm binding a editable collection to a datagridview.  For some reason the broken rules don't show explanation points in the datagridview.  I have verified that the rules are indeed in the brokenrule list as errors.  I'm stumped here.  In the past I have not had to do any coding in the UI to get the error icon in a datagridview.  Any ideas here?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>GWZ replied on Friday, June 05, 2009</h2>Insure that an Error Provider is in the form and that the DataSource property is set to binding source of your business object ( the same binding source as the DataGridView).</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, June 05, 2009</h2>Hi, <br><br>I assume we are discussing Window Forms DataGridView. <br><br>Make sure your RowTemplate.Height is at least 21 pixels. If height is less than 21 the DataGridView will not show any error icons (not even a "clipped" image)<br><br>And - the DataGridView has its own ErrorProvider implementation. There is no need for an additional ErrorProvider in your form in order to show errors in a DataGridView. <br><br>/jonny <br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
