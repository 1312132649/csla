I created a customers collections class, derived from BusinessListBase, which contains a collection of editable customer objects. Each customer class contains a child collection of contacts. In order to persist everything I just call customers.save().<br /><br />My question : Does the csla allow that I can save each customer object in the customers collection manually rather that persisting the whole customers collection? I dont want to use a read only list of customers, as I will need to refresh the list every time one customer object has been edited. Any ideas ?<br /><br />Thanks</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, November 24, 2008</h2>CSLA .NET version 2.1 and higher includes EditableRootListBase, which allows you to load a collection of editable root objects, and then you can (must) save each individual root object as it is changed.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
