<p>I&#39;m really confused about the possible upgrade option.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken the development responsibility from my senior who has actually developed the web project from scratch using CSLA. </p>
<p>Currently we are using visual studio 2005 but i&#39;m &nbsp;not aware which version of CSLA are we using. Is there any way to know version of CSLA currently i&#39;m using.</p>
<p>Also I&#39;m planning to upgrade application to .Net Framework 4.0 and&nbsp;possibly CSLA as well. Can anyone suggest me about the possible way to upgrade latest version of CSLA?&nbsp;Which is the most stable and newer version of CSLA should i possibly upgrade to?</p>
<p>Waiting for prompt response.</p>
<p>Regards<br />Nish&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bniemyjski replied on Tuesday, November 08, 2011</h2><p>Hello,</p>
<p>To get the CSLA Version you are using, I&#39;d recommend looking in Solution Explorer under your Projects Assembly References for the CSLA Reference and right click it and select properties. Did you write all of the existing Business Objects by scratch or generate them with CSLA Contrib?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 08, 2011</h2><p>This may help too:</p>

<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>I found out current version of CSLA that we are using and it&#39;s 2.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently we are using codesmith to generate the class file and store procedure. We do have customized template to make it more simple.</p>
<p>I am just wondering if i want to auto generate business class in visual studio 2010 do i still need to use codesmith or there is any other options available?</p>

<p>You could generate business classes in VS2010 using <a href="http://www.codesmithtools.com/product/frameworks#csla">CodeSmith Generator</a> or you could write your own. It&#39;s entirely up to you. We have made it easy to upgrade from the CSLA Contrib templates you were using, but I&#39;m not aware of what&nbsp;customization&#39;s&nbsp;you were using. I&#39;d recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.jenasysdesign.com.au/dnn/Blogs/tabid/71/EntryId/4/Lessons-from-the-last-year-of-CSLA-codegeneration.aspx">this</a>.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
