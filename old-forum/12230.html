Its best to factor a CSLA implementation to only have the web server responsible for Log in security and load balance. The database layer should shred the data graph and deliver XML to the front end. The web server should not touch the XML normally. The front end should normally deal with XML unless loop performance becomes an issue. As Rocky states, the demonstrative implementation is really only an example. If you try to use that in an ASP.NET MVC stack, you are just screwing yourself out of performance and time and the real benefits of CSLA.</p>

<p>of course, someone&#39;s mileage will vary (and so should their factoring), but I have found my current philosophy has yet to be challenged by anything my particular job has thrown at it. XML on the front, a simple as possible web layer with 0-1 DB calls per method, and an overbuilt set of SQL sprocs performs AMAZINGLY and makes Chuck Norris die.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
