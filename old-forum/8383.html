Decided to use MVC and CSLA. I found it very easy to start off with and completed the site really quickly. No real problems encountered.</P>
<P>1 thing I did not have time to check is the new (?) CslaModelBinder. You might want to check that out.</P>
<P>Otherwise you should be fine.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xAvailx replied on Tuesday, January 26, 2010</h2>Depends on which version of MVC you will be using. If using MVC 1, then it should work just fine. If using MVC 2, then there are some compile time issues with the Csla MVC binder.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, January 26, 2010</h2>And that depends on which beta/RC/whatever you get for MVC 2 :)</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
