Business objects must be denormalized to work properly within CSLA (and databinding).&nbsp; Having a single child object within a root object is going to cause you a lot of headache and will not work as you may hope/expect. <br><br>As an example: ValidationRules must be within the "primary" object as VS WinForm designer will only create one BindingSource and this breaks your design of entity objects. <br>/jonny <br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
