They often would like to know if anyone else has used it to create an app like theirs.</P>
<P>That might mean high-scale web, super-complex Windows Forms, as a service-consumer, as a service-creator, etc.</P>
<P>I maintain a page with some limited information: <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Usage.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Usage.aspx</A></P>
<P>But the reality is that most companies (for various reasons) won't allow their name to be used.</P>
<P>I understand that, but I'm wondering if there's a workaround of sorts. I'm wondering if some of you on the forum, as individuals rather than companies, would be willing to act as a reference? Be willing to occassionally accept an email or phone call from someone considering using CSLA .NET to discuss (in broad terms) your experiences. Without revealing your organization of course.</P>
<P>Thoughts?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, July 27, 2009</h2>I should point out that this is spurred by an immediate need for someone with very complex Windows Forms (tons of controls per form, etc).</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Wbmstrmjb replied on Monday, July 27, 2009</h2>We use it for a fairly complex web application, but I would be willing to act as a reference.  <br /><br />Once you "get" CSLA, you just can't think of using another framework.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, July 28, 2009</h2>Hi Rocky,<br><br>You can add me to your reference list. I've been using CSLA for since versjon 2.1 on primarily WinForms applications, some web services (WCF) and a small webapplication. <br><br>Jonny Bekkum<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 28, 2009</h2>Thank you both very much, I really appreciate it!</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Wednesday, July 29, 2009</h2>My name can be added in this.
