<p>We have a 4 Silverlight DataGrids representing a Great Grand Child hierarchy of objects. &nbsp;Each level loads its children with a lazy load.</p>
<p>Our user clicks the edit button, which calls BeginEdit on the root list which moves to Edit Level 1. &nbsp;This is the base behavior for our application.</p>
<p>When we click on a child in the DataGrid the grid then fires its own BeginEdit on the record thereby moving that record to Edit Level 2. &nbsp;At the same time the async fetch of the child list starts and when it returns the child list property is loaded using LoadProperty.</p>
<p>I can see the LoadProperty moves the child list from Edit Level 0 to 1, but the parent is on 2. &nbsp;Why does the LoadProperty not move the edit level to 2 to match its parent object?</p>
<p>When apply edit is called on that record, I get the Edit Level missmatch error.</p>
<p>I have made a workaround by BeginEdit on the child list after the LoadProperty to bring the Edit Level in line, this is working. &nbsp;I would just love to know the reason for the LoadProperty only increasing the child list to Edit Level 1.</p>
<p>Any insights into this would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;We are using CSLA 4.2 and are looking to upgrade to 4.5 soon.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bwebber replied on Tuesday, February 05, 2013</h2><p>Any answers to this? &nbsp;We are still having this same issue.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
