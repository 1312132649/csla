<P>When the user is on the screen on which they edit all the vehicle/owner/title data, they often want to print either a certificate of registration or a certificate of title.</P>
<P>I'm using the DevExpress xtraReport tool here and have built a report that should work just fine.&nbsp; And of course the tool is capable of binding to business objects which is the major reason I'm using it.&nbsp; Sounds good so far, eh?</P>
<P>My problem is that the report tool can only bind to objects that implement IList (which doesn't seem such a harsh requirement), but when users are editing my Vehicle object, it's an ERO - which, of course, doesn't implement IList.</P>
<P>[If you don't use an IList-capable report tool, just imagine that you want to display your ERO's properties in one row of a datagrid in which case you run into exactly the same obstacle I face here.]</P>
<P>I guess I can build a child collection (or perhaps better, a single-member R-O Collection object) to clone my ERO's properties just for the report.&nbsp; But this seems quite the kludge, doesn't it?!!</P>
<P>Isn't there a more elegant way to solve this?&nbsp; For example, could I make my Vehicle ERO implement IList well enough for the report to bind to its properties?&nbsp; And, if so, how?&nbsp; And if not, are there other appealing options that I'm too dense to see yet?</P>
<P>Thanks in advance,</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 26, 2006</h2>Perhaps you can do what Microsoft does in .NET 2.0, and just put your object into a list?<br><br>If you bind a single object in .NET 2.0, they automatically create a list object, put your object into it, and use the list as the data source to the controls.

<P>I used an ArrayList.&nbsp; It was simple as can be and worked perfectly on the first try.&nbsp; Thanks for the great tip!</P>
<P>For other new DevExpress xtraReport users who may be lurking - I declared the ArrayList Public in my xtraReport file (sure I could have written a property set procedure instead).&nbsp; Then in the button click code from my form I just (1)create the local ArrayList, (2).Add my BO to it, (3)create the local report object, (4) assign my local ArrayList to the Report's one, and (5)call ShowPreview.</P>
<P>Of course creating the bound controls on the report will be a task of varying difficulty in different circumstances.&nbsp; But in my case, I had built the report with Access (having built a query for it) and simply imported it into a new xtraReport.&nbsp; I never had to write a single line of code to handle the binding.&nbsp; This feels pretty efficient to me!!</P>
<P>Thanks again, Rocky.</P>
