<P>I've been using ActiveObjects 2 for some time now. I have attached a sample from one of my projects, all my BO's are created as partial classes, one part generated one part handcrafted (wich is also generated, but only just once). I hope this helps.<BR>Petar did send me some sample code&nbsp;just before he released AO-2, I'll ask him if I can post those files here or maybe he could publish some sample code on his website.<BR><BR>ActiveBinder works more or less the same as it did before.</P>
<P>ActiveEditForm is not known to me.</P>
<P>AFAIK Observer works more or less the same as it did before, however it has been optimized.</P>
<P><BR>I know of one problem with ActiveObjects that is not yet been fixed in the current version :</P>

But when moving to 2.0 things change a lot. All the ApplyEdit / ApplyEditSave / BeginEdit / CancelEdit stuff is kind of pointless now, because you're supposed to handle those with the BindingSource.<br>Also, I don't use the Control Binder anymore. It still works, but you can't beat dragging and dropping controls. I suppose some of the features could be moved to extender controls or just create new controls that use those features, but I don't find myself missing them (at least for now).<br>The only part of the control binder I was using was the error tree view,&nbsp; but I recently created a treeview for that purpose that works with AO and plain CSLA. The good thing about it is that it doesn't redraw the whole tree when rules are changed, it just keeps track of existing rules and objects and redraws only the parts that changed. It also handlles the coming severity stuff using icons and colors. I will put that in the contrib site as soon as csla 2.1 is frozen.<br><br>I ended up building different objects to aid me in the saving process, which is pretty straightforward, and I have a base form that registers to the object.<br>I use the stuff I mention in <a HREF="/forums/thread/341.aspx">this thread</a>, which help me a lot. Generics in windows forms are a true time saver. (and a cast saver :D)<br><br>Andrés</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cash_pat replied on Sunday, July 30, 2006</h2>To XAL<br><br>But without the ActiveControlBinder the error icon doesn't go away unit the control loses focus. Am I doing something wrong. <br><br>Also I could not get what you meant by Generic Inheritance. I am using Visual inheritance and inheritance in my forms. Your sample code also contains a class MagicAttributes. What does it do. Please Elaborate <br>How would it turn to be useful.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Sunday, July 30, 2006</h2>If you look at the form's class definition, it's <br><br>Public Class MyForm<br>&nbsp; Inherits BaseForm(Of MyBO)<br><br>End Class<br><br>In your base form you could expose something like:<br><br>Public ReadOnly Property Model As T<br>...<br>End Property<br><br><br>There's obviously a lot more to it than just that... just use your imagination. The point is that VS can't handle forms inheritance when generics are involved or when your base form is MustInherit, because the designer makes an instance of your base form in order to show it. That's where the "MagicAttriburtes" come in place... <br><br>You could do something like this in your base form:<br><br>Protected MustOverride GetModel() As T<br>Protected MustOverride GetMainBindingSource() As BindingSource<br><br><br><br>That would help abstract the endedit call and the RaiseListChange property in your binding source when you save.<br><br>About the error icons, you could change the way databinding works in the designer by going to your textbox and expanding the DataBindings property... There you can define the event you want to use to keep your controls in sync with your bo...<br>Or you could also write extender controls for that purpose....<br><br>I hope that helps...<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>gdk9am replied on Wednesday, December 20, 2006</h2><P>Hi</P>
