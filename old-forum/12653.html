<p>It is derived from the <b>Csla.Core.ExtendedBindingListBase&lt;T&gt;</b> type, so it would seem to be intended for supporting <i>Windows Forms?</i></p>
<p>If that is indeed correct what is the <i>WPF/XAML/ObservableCollection</i> equivalent, or is it safe for usage with the <i>XAML</i> binding?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Jaans&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Saturday, May 31, 2014</h2><p>Since the NVLB is a special kind of read only list and not editable, I believe it should be fine for use with Xaml, much like there is not a separate base&nbsp;for ROL to use between WinForms and Xml.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jaans replied on Sunday, June 01, 2014</h2><p>Hi Andy</p>
<p>Actually there is a different base class for Read Only Lists for use in WinForms vs. Xaml.</p>
<p><i>WinForms</i> should use :&nbsp;<b>Csla.ReadOnlyBindingListBase&lt;T,C&gt;<br /></b><i>Xaml</i> (or more accurately ObserverableCollection consumers) should use:&nbsp;<b>Csla.ReadOnlyListBase&lt;T, C&gt;</b></p>
<p>It because of this that I&#39;m questioning NameValueListBase - it seems to have been missed in the base class split..<br /><br />Disclaimer: Unless I&#39;ve got it all very wrong that is.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Sunday, June 01, 2014</h2><p>Hmm, so there is a ROBLB.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t have thought so, since the list and items in the list don&#39;t change so whether or not the list is the WPF one or BL I wouldn&#39;t expect to matter.&nbsp; That said, have you tried it?&nbsp; I image if a separate one were needed, it&#39;d have been created by now.&nbsp; that or maybe NVL doesn&#39;t get much use. :)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, June 02, 2014</h2><p>There is other reasons for that too. </p>
<p>SortedBindingList and FilteredBindingList should work as expected for both editable and readonly lists in WinForms.</p>
<p>At least for WPF there is some support for BindingList lists but sorting only works with ObservableCollection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NameValueListBase is intended for readonly data the should not need sorting/filtering and thus there is no need to have different versions/base classes.&nbsp;</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
