<p>.i.e. when if (TargetControl != null&nbsp; &amp;&amp; !CanRead) </p>
<p>MethodCaller.CallMethodIfImplemented(TargetControl, &quot;set_Visibility&quot;, Visibility.Collapsed);</p>
<p>I tried to figure out a way to inject this behavior without doing an outright copy of the control, including handling OnPropertyChanged of CanRead in a descendent of PropertyStatus, but the first time around within CanRead&nbsp;it appears that TargetControl is null - so the second time CanRead is set to false below, the CanRead doesn&#39;t actually invoke OnPropertyChanged.</p>

That was a dead-end, because everyone wants it to work differently, and it was really not in the spirit of XAML.</p>
<p>PropertyStatus exposes a set of properties, such as CanRead. You can bind your UI control to the PropertyStatus control (usually with a value converter) to alter the properties of the UI control (or its container) to make it visible or not, change its color - whatever you&#39;d like to do.</p>
<p>These properties exist in 3.8 and higher, and in CSLA 4 the idea of controlling the UI control is completely gone.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
