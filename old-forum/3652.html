updated regularly?&nbsp; I'm hoping to find somewhat recent templates.&nbsp;
CodeSmith seems to have fallen out of favor.&nbsp; CodeComplete says it stays up to date with CSLA, but I can't figure out what version of CSLA they are using. <br><br>I posted this in the other section, but no response yet.&nbsp; I have a new developer that I am managing remotely, and I need to find out if I have to buy a CodeSmith license for her.&nbsp; <br><br>Thanks,<br>Ray<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Friday, October 05, 2007</h2><P>I use Codesmith.</P>
<P>It is a fantastic tool.</P>
<P>I believe the sample templates for C# are up to date (Ricky Supit does a lot of work there.)</P>
<P>Over the years I have tweaked my VB templates to meet my own style and coding conventions.</P>
<P>If you take the templates as a Starting point and modify them to meet your needs you shuold be OK.</P>
<P>Not sure why you think Codesmith has falen out of favor? Maybe people are too busy using it to keep touting it as the next best thing.</P>

<P>First my background as it is relevant.&nbsp; I have been coding CSLA for about 2 years and have been to Rocky's classes at VSLive.&nbsp; I am a big fan of hand coding the cool stuff but hate coding the database objects.&nbsp; I have used several codegen products (former nettiers guy).</P>
<P>First CodeSmith: I own a license for this and really like it for generating NetTiers.&nbsp; I used to recommend it for basic CSLA stuff.&nbsp; It seems now that the template crowd has backed off this community.&nbsp; I also didn't like the disconnect between the sql stored procs and Csla proc names.&nbsp; They weren't the same.&nbsp; I know how to change the templates and did, but I am assuming the reader would want something ready out of the box. I downloaded the templates from Codeplex.</P>
<P>Second MyGeneration: I used it after CodeSmith.&nbsp; I like that it generated the project in a hurry!&nbsp; What I didn't like is the liberties it took with the framework.&nbsp; I am not saying it is bad.&nbsp; It just isn't the way I write my objects.&nbsp; It did work though.&nbsp; Templates also available through Codeplex site on Source tab.</P>
<P>Finally CodeComplete:&nbsp; I actually bought this last night!&nbsp; I really like it.&nbsp; It supports Csla 2 out of the box but you can drop the new Csla compiled .dll in the installation directory (replacing the old after you copy it somewhere!) to get the 3.x support.&nbsp; Now, they have a new version coming out in the fall native to 3.xxxx.&nbsp; I really like this product for Csla generating but I am still fairly new with CodeComplete.&nbsp; Beware though, when you purchase it, it takes them a few hours to get you the download link.&nbsp; Their support is good (so far) as well.</P>
<P>I know that this isn't an answer as such.&nbsp; I have simply found that generators thrive in different areas.&nbsp; The CodeSmith Nettiers is really cool if you use if for that.&nbsp; However, for Csla (which I use mostly now) I find CodeComlete very interesting.&nbsp; Go to their site <A href="http://eurowisesoft.com">http://eurowisesoft.com</A>&nbsp; and watch the videos.&nbsp; Good luck!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Friday, October 05, 2007</h2><P>re: MyGeneration and your comment: "What I didn't like is the liberties it took with the framework.&nbsp; I am not saying it is bad.&nbsp; It just isn't the way I write my objects.&nbsp;"</P>
<P>Are you talking about the behavior of the template you used or the behavior of MyGeneration?&nbsp; </P>
<P>If the former, it doesn't matter to me because I always found it useful to modify templates my use for per project (whether I used CodeSmith or MyGeneration).&nbsp; If the latter, I'd be interested in "the liberties with the framework" you felt it was taking.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>Install the Sql Server Northwind Database (because CodeComplete only allows this database in demo mode :-) and use these three to generate a class or two from it.&nbsp; You will see the difference immediately.&nbsp; Mygeneration does a couple of things a little different.&nbsp; I would post classes but I won't be at my computer for about 5 more hours.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeanB replied on Sunday, October 07, 2007</h2><P>I just thought I would follow up with my thoughts on Code Complete.&nbsp; I want to start by saying I think it has the potential to be the "one" for Csla code generation.&nbsp; However, right now, I can't say I recommend it.&nbsp; I am going to use it though.&nbsp; Now that those two sentences have torn a whole in the universe let me explain.&nbsp; It is a wonderful tool for generating Csla objects especially IF YOU DON'T USE STORED PROCEDURES IN SQL SERVER 2005.&nbsp; If this is your situation then buy it!&nbsp; However, most of us aren't in that club.&nbsp; There is a confirmed issue with generating stored procedures when you select more than one table in the database to generate objects against (Confirmed by Phillip from Code Complete on 10/07/2007).&nbsp; I got an email just this morning from their support stating they are working on it.&nbsp; In fairness, they did suggest a work around.&nbsp; Here is what they said: </P>
<P><FONT face=Consolas>You could try to create the data sources one by one and see whether it generates the SPs that way.</FONT></P>
<P>The problem with this is that many of us work with very large databases.&nbsp; Doing it one at a time robs efficiency from a tool that otherwise excels.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I have said before that their response times are great.&nbsp; They did say they are looking at it and hope to issue a fix soon.&nbsp; As soon as they do, I will update this post.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Let me state again for the record:&nbsp; Phillip in customer support has been very good at answering all my questions in a very timely fashion.&nbsp; They certainly get an A+ for that!</P>
<P><STRONG>Conclusion:</STRONG> This generator has the potential to be the "one".&nbsp; HOWEVER, many developers will likely find the Stored Procedure generation bug a deal breaker.&nbsp; Keep your eyes open for a fix though.&nbsp; I WILL UPDATE THIS AS SOON AS I HEAR MORE.</P>
<P><STRONG>Remember:</STRONG>&nbsp; I have years of experience in Csla and Code Generation (though I am somewhat new to this forum).&nbsp; These observations are my personal conclusions based on my experience.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeanB replied on Monday, November 12, 2007</h2><P>Updated Code Complete Thoughts.</P>
<P>I promised an update to the Code Complete review I wrote earlier.&nbsp; Here it is!</P>
<P>Pros:</P>
<P>1. User Experience</P>
<P>First let me say I am using the newest version available on their site as of today.&nbsp; In my original review I blasted the product for its lack of support for SQL 2005 stored procs.&nbsp; This has been cleared up in the latest release.&nbsp; I haven't run into any issues that with my production database.&nbsp; This product has really nice wizards that help you generate a pretty complete solution.&nbsp; It certainly stands shoulders above its competition in this area.&nbsp; The resulting code is great.&nbsp; The generator uses Csla version 3.</P>
<P>2. Tech Support</P>
<P>Outstanding.&nbsp; Best I have come across that is email based.&nbsp; Keep in mind timezone issues though.&nbsp; Sometimes answers take 12 hours or so.&nbsp; I had no issues where the answer didn't address the issue.</P>
<P>Cons:</P>
<P>1.&nbsp; When you are going through the wizard, there is a annoying behavior where you can't resize a drop down list.&nbsp; For instance: If you select a table and go to select a column via drop down, It is very likely your column name (if say above 10 characters) will not be totally visible.&nbsp; This seems very bizarre to me.</P>
<P>2.&nbsp; The demo mode is too restrictive.&nbsp; I think they should have followed the CodeSmith model.&nbsp; Their product is high quality.&nbsp; They should let demo users generate against on of their own databases.&nbsp; I am certain that given this opportunity, more people would purchase the product.&nbsp; If they don't do this at least use a more complex database like adventureworks for the demo project.</P>
<P>3. No Visual Studio 2008 Integration (In fairness, this isn't a real big issue since VS 2008 isn't yet gold.&nbsp; If you are a MSDN user you must have BOTH VS 2005 and VS 2008 on the machine you intend to generate code on.&nbsp; You can use VS 2008 to update the project.&nbsp; I have had no issues doing this.</P>
<P>FINAL THOUGHTS:</P>
<P>When comparing code generators for CSLA projects only (CodeComplete, CodeSmith, MyGeneration) I am giving the nod to CodeComplete.&nbsp; Their product isn't perfect but given the progress lately and their dedicated technical support, I see no reason it won't continue to distinguish itself among Csla generators.&nbsp; I really hope all the issues listed under the Cons section get resolved.&nbsp; However, (except for the wizard combo box sizes) none of them are very big issues.<BR>I personally own CodeSmith and love it too.&nbsp; However, for strictly Csla products, I think CodeComplete has a definite&nbsp;edge.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeanB replied on Monday, October 08, 2007</h2>Just an update.&nbsp; I got an email from the Code Complete people.&nbsp; They said that the Sql fix is a very high priority and that they are currently working on it.&nbsp; I think I will be beta testing the fix so I will update accordingly.&nbsp; I think we are looking at days not weeks but I have been wrong before! :-)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Rayk replied on Monday, October 08, 2007</h2>Thanks for all the feedback.&nbsp; <br><br>We've used the CodeSmith templates, and we've tweaked them a bit to our liking.&nbsp; For example, if a field is nullable, and we put a ZERO in the property, we want the ZERO to go to the database, not a null.&nbsp; Also, we don't remove the underscores from the field names, because we also use the business objects for end-user report generating, and having the underscores in the column names really helps end-users.&nbsp; <br><br>I will check out the CodeSmith templates again to see about the updates.&nbsp; I will also download a trial of CodeComplete and see what is up with that.&nbsp; <br><br>-Ray<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Tuesday, October 09, 2007</h2><P>We use CodeSmith as well, but we wrote our own templates.&nbsp; It's not hard to do if you're familiar with the ASP.NET style of code.</P>
<P>We used our own templates to:<BR>(1) Produce classes that worked off our own extensions to the CSLA framework.<BR>(2) Match our own coding style and conventions.</P>
<P>In fact we took our code generation a step further by writing a&nbsp;CodeSmith.Dll that can be called from our templates that provides supporting classes and functionality to the code generation process.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
