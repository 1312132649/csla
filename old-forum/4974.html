<P>Here's a quick view: I have a process where measurements are taken at Sample station A on a preset frequency. Three or more production lines then consume the results and display interpreted results on the&nbsp;monitor located at the machine that produced the component. That workstation needs to receive the notices without operator interaction (or it won't get done). So, Machine 1 operator goes to the Sample station A; those results are sent to a data store. then I believe a message is sent to the service that new data is available for machine 1. That new data is packaged or a simple "get an update" message is sent to Machine 1 which receives and interprets the data.</P>
<P>The&nbsp;goals are to&nbsp;to have the results of the test communicated to the production lines and to notify stations that a sample is due to be taken or an alert if the process is out of control.</P>
<P>This seems to indicate a messaging structure. The client has not purchased VS2008, but are willing if needed. I've been working with CSLA 3.0.4 and .net 2.0 runtime and have had little need to request a new version.</P>
<P>I believe CSLA supports this, but I'm not sure which technology to read and digest. the project is to be implemented in mid July, so I think i have time, especially if I get the right technology researched and implemented.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance for any&nbsp;help! Back to MSDN and the CSLA books.</P>
