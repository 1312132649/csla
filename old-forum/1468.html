<P>Here is one&nbsp;PostgreSQL .Net Data provider...</P>

<P>And here is a site that will help with any connectiong string problem you may have...</P>
<P><A href="http://www.connectionstrings.com/">http://www.connectionstrings.com/</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As an alternative to the PostgreSQL .Net Data provider you can use the System.Data.Common.DbProviderFactory if you are using .Net 2.0.&nbsp; This is a generic data provider.</P>
<P>Hope this helps.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kobruleht replied on Thursday, October 12, 2006</h2><P>My ultimata goal is to create WinForm or GTK# GUI application running under Linux.</P>

<P>I have not used a CSLA app with PostgreSQL but if you can connect to a PostgreSQL database using the sample connection strings provided in my previous post that istdoes not matter if your app is Csla based or not.&nbsp; If you can connect from with .Net then you should be able to connect from&nbsp;your Csla BO's.</P>
<P>I have connect to databases such as SQL Server, Oracle, and Firebird in the past I they work fine, regardless of Csla or not.&nbsp; So, I don't see any problems in you using PostgreSQL on a remote linux box.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kobruleht replied on Thursday, October 12, 2006</h2><P>I need to port large GUI accounting application to Linux. This application in written in Microsoft Visual FoxPro so this will be complete code rewrite.</P>
<P>I created this application prototype: WinForm application which connects to PostgreSQL database using npgsql and allows edit data in DataGrid and uses MainMenu &nbsp;(DataGridView and MenuStrip do not work in MONO, .NET 2 Winforms are mostly not implemented).</P>
<P>I have three choices now:</P>
<P>1. Find a GUI framework which supports MONO and Postgres. I tried but hav'ent found such.</P>
<P>2. Create my own framework.</P>
<P>3. Modify CSLA 2.1 (CSLA 1.1 fails to buid on VCS Express 2005 so I don't consider this) or some other framework. </P>
<P>Modifying CSLA 2.1 requires the following changes:</P>
<P>1. Change all .NET 2 Winforms controls to .NET 1.1 controls to work in current MONO </P>
<P>2. Change all other .NET 2 API calls to .NET 1.1 API calls to work in current MONO</P>
<P>3. Change CSLA database access logic to work with MONO and npgsql </P>
<P>So using CSLA seems to be huge work. </P>
<P>I need also a GUI report designer which can be used by end users. Currently I'm planning to use <A href="http://www.fyireporting.com">http://www.fyireporting.com</A></P>

<P>This may not be "help", but you are planning on recreating an Accounting package (MAS 90? ACCPAC?&nbsp;:shudders:)&nbsp;on an open source platform that contains incomplete functionality.
