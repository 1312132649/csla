<p>There&#39;s been a lot of talk since BUILD about how Metro/WinRT is the future of Windows development, but from what little I&#39;ve seen so far, it seems very similar to Silverlight - running in a limited subset of .NET that doesn&#39;t give you full access to the PC.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the applications I&#39;m looking at updating communicate with numerous client-side devices.&nbsp; Examples - scales, coin sorters, custom industrial printers, cash drawers, receipt printers, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I was prepared to jump all-in and migrate these apps to WPF/MVVM, but I hate to invest development resources/dollars in a technology that Microsoft considers now seems to consider &quot;legacy&quot;.&nbsp; However, I don&#39;t see many other options on the table.</p>
<p>Thoughts? Or am I making much ado about nothing? </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>Curelom replied on Wednesday, October 05, 2011</h2><p>Rocky has detailed some of the differences Metro will make in some other posts.&nbsp; If you start building your apps now as WPF/MVVM you should be in good shape.&nbsp; These applications would still work as Desktop Apps in Windows 8 and porting them would mostly be on the GUI/XAML side of things.</p>
<p>Rocky details it in his blog.</p>
