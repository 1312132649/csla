<P>I have a root object - meeting.&nbsp; In that I have a list - AgendaItems.&nbsp; Each AgendaItem in the AgendaItems list has a PersonsResponsible list of type PersonResponsible.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In other words...my child objects have child object.</P>
<P>My question is this.&nbsp; Am I correct in assuming that there is no way to do a fetch from MEETING that fetches the children of the child.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;in my example, do I have to implement a call to the database in the AgendaItem object.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I know this is a simple question.&nbsp; I have used the CodeSmith templates to learn how it all works&nbsp;and there is no way to recreate this example from the templates.&nbsp; And I believe that rocky does not implement anything like this in the Project Manager.&nbsp; An example would be great to see.</P>
<P>Thanks.&nbsp; You guys make this a great forum.</P>

<P>This question is asked a lot apparently and I found this previous thread.&nbsp; So I answered my own question.</P>
