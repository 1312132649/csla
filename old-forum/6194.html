I also see "If a method in a class library has been removed, recompile any assemblies that reference that library." Well, I haven't, but I'm getting a fresh copy of the 3.0.5 release and will recompile and relaunch PTracker example.<br /><br />When stepping through, I see that global context is null stepping into the csla.DataPortal and I see<br />result = proxy.Create(objectType, criteria, dpContext);<br />where dpContext is null. Seems strange.<br /><br />I can use NVL just fine, but when I started to debug the guts of the code in a real BO, I ran into problems. In my DataPortal_Create method I do go to the db, so there's no [RunLocal] decoration.<br /><br />Any suggestions?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>esteban404 replied on Monday, January 19, 2009</h2>It's in the create method in the SimpleDataPortal. I've found some threads, but I don't understand what I've done wrong in the code. It fails when it hits this line<br />obj = Activator.CreateInstance(objectType, true);<br /><br />The debugger says it's of the correct type, but I don't get any further.<br /><br />Any help?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>esteban404 replied on Monday, January 19, 2009</h2>Found it. It's going for the time being. :-)</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jkornit replied on Tuesday, March 24, 2009</h2><P>what was the answer?</P>
<P>I am running into it too.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jkornit replied on Tuesday, March 24, 2009</h2><P>never mind (thanks anyway)&nbsp; I got it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I had commented out the ctor in order to force a parameter... big no no.</P>
<P>i re-added the parameterless ctor.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
