<P>We don't use the Error Provider to display errors, but rather we display a pop-up dialog of the broken rules.&nbsp; We are currently getting ready to move to the 2.0 framework and I was wondering how others are handing this?</P>
<P>We currently use a helper class that was written by someone (not sure who, but thanks!) for version 1.0 of the CSLA Framework.&nbsp; The class took a business object and, via reflection, built a complete list of rules for the parent and all subsequent children.</P>
<P>We are also looking at create a commerical software package and from a design perspective, were wondering just what is the best way to display broken rules to the end user!</P>

I prefer having the list of all rules and child rules in one place. So this uses reflection to do it. It also took some interfaces as I recall. Let me know if you find the code.</P>
