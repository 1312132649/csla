<p>1.&nbsp; How far out are we for a version of CSLA for WP8?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I&#39;m writing windows phone and w8 apps that need to communicate with a remote data portal and be as fast as possible.&nbsp; Part of the process will be transmitting large image files as byte arrays.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I&#39;m eventually going to have to support&nbsp;iOS and android devices, and I would like to use the same WCF service if possible.&nbsp; I&#39;m new to CSLA, and I know the mobile WCF data portal uses the basic HTTP binding.&nbsp;&nbsp;What would result in the best performance and support for other devices?&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I use the&nbsp;built in Mobile data portal&nbsp;or would it be best if I wrote another data portal that uses JSON?&nbsp; I hope this question makes sense, again I&#39;m just getting on my way with CSLA.&nbsp; Forgive me if I have missed something obvious.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Tuesday, January 29, 2013</h2><p>I can&#39;t give guidance on the performance related questions you ask, but I recently published in the Windows Store a <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/scripture-box/7dbb93e1-0894-4f00-86f2-d24c1d9dd9ab">WinRT app</a> that utilizes CSLA 4.5. My early approach included using the standard (WCF) data portal hosted in an Azure Cloud Service. While performance for that was working fine for me, I ended up opting for using Azure Mobile Services instead of a remote DP...mainly due to the built-in authentication provided by Azure as well as less complexity on the deployment side. (I might regret that later as I seek to scale to other platforms, but we&#39;ll see.)</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is to handle offline scenarios. I had started down the road of committing all transactions to the database immediately via the CSLA DP. But when I realized that a user may be offline while using the app, I switched to having my CSLA DP writing transactions to SQLite on the client. When the user is connected to the internet, I periodically sync those transactions to Azure. Not sure if that is necessary in your use case but I wanted to throw that out there for consideration.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, February 02, 2013</h2><p>The code in svn (trunk) does currently work on WP8, and that&#39;ll roll out in the next release - yet this month if all goes well.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
