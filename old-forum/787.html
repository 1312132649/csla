<P>I am now adding an Asp UI.&nbsp; Asp's Membership provider's extensive capabilities are hard to resist. I have done everything according to the book, providing a MembershipPrincipal and making the changes in the Global.asax.&nbsp; Logging in and out is working fine, but the Identity now has no resemblence to the Identity that my objects will respond to.&nbsp; Part of the issue is my IsInRole method which performs a finer-grained check of user capabilities - which I had implemented in the Security DB user.</P>
<P>Is there a mechanism by which the Identity from the Security DB could be used instead of the the one in the System.SecurityPrinciplal?</P>
<P>I am not sure if the Membership database's user table can be extended by the addition of a field or two.&nbsp; If so, that could also help the situation.</P>
<P>Thanks for any help</P>
