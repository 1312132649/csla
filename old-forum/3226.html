<P>I have added two projects and assign the same resource to both these projects. In projectA the resource role was Developer but i have assigned this same resource to ProjectB as role Tester. When i select the Tester from dropdown it throws System.InvalidOperationException that this resource already allocated to some other project and when i clicked Ok it does this without any hesitance. I guess this message shouldn't be come up because a personnal can have different roles depends upon the project that resource is going to assigned.</P>
<P>Regards,</P>
