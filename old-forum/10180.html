<p>I know you say you find you use VB6 quite frequently, but it might be time to let it go.&nbsp; I think VB6 may be dead to MS as well.</p>
<p>If you just need to write COM components, could you use VB.Net and expose the functionality via COM interop?&nbsp; Or do you need to still support Windows clients that don&#39;t support .Net at all (pre-WinXp / Win2k)?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, March 20, 2011</h2><p>Any info I have (which does include one download, but I don&#39;t think it is the full codebase) is here:</p>
