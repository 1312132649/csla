Is the only difference in their UI use based on the databinding?  I'm using mostly web grids so would the dynamic editable list be of no use to me because it's meant for Windows grids?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 02, 2009</h2><P>Yes, that is an accurate assessment. I think that ERLB has less value in the web world.</P>
<P>I won't say NO value though, because there are stateful server scenarios where it could be very nice.</P>
<P>For example, if you retrieve a collection of 500 items, and the user views most of them and only edits a very few - and other users are unlikely to be editing the same data at the same time - you could use an ERLB very effectively by storing it in an in-proc Session and using it to just update the few rows of data edited by the user.</P>
<P>But in any stateless web server scenario I can't see where ERLB would have any real value at all.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
