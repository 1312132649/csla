If you're doing a Windows Forms application, then you'll find the 2008 book a little light on guidance, although I think Rocky is planning on releasing a Windows Forms with CSLA 3.6 PDF book later in the year.</font></li><li><font color="#006400" size="2" face="Arial">Read these forums, they're very active. I'd advise just dedicating an hour to read through 4 or 5 pages of the most recent posts, even if some of it makes no sense or does not apply, it's amazing what little snippets of help and knowledge you can get.</font></li></ul><font size="2" face="Arial">A couple of things to watch out for;<br></font><ul><li><font color="#006400" size="2" face="Arial">LINQ to SQL has fallen out of favour and as such is probably not now the most ideal data access technology to follow. Personally I'm still using ADO.Net to create SQL Connection/Command objects that I load in my DataPortal methods.</font></li><li><font color="#006400" size="2" face="Arial">The User Interface for Project Tracker is fairly light on it's coverage of databinding scenarios, for instance it doesn't really illustrate binding to an editable parent as well as an editable datagrid of child objects on that parent.</font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#006400">Windows Forms is the oldest and most mature of the UI technologies (when compared to Silverlight and WPF) and so is supported by CSLA, however over time it may become less supported purely due to the attention that Silverlight and WPF recieve, so it will pay to keep an eye on WPF/Silverlight.</font><br></font></li></ul><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course this is based purley from my own experience just this last week in learning CSLA 3.6.1 and is therefore biased to my own problems that I've posted elsewhere in the forums.<br></font></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
