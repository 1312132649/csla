<P>I&nbsp;have not seen the code in beta yet, code which i'm referring to is for 2.0.3, ValidationRules.AddRules method there is directly adding the rule without doing any checking like how it is done when adding brokenrules..</P>
<P>any ideas when the beta version be converted to stable versiion.</P>
