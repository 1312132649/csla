before. I've tried pitching the idea of doing new development in .NET
with CSLA to a company I've been consulting with for the last couple of
years unsuccessfully. Basically, in response to their request for a
better way to do things. However, it turned out, it was just talk, the
owner and managers aren't risk takers. Especially, as the company is
making money the way it does things now, and nobody wants to rock the
boat. Worse the other developers who are currently using an old version
of an out of favor programming lanaguage, are worried about such a
move, as that would remove their unique usefulness, so they offered no
support.<br>
<br>
My point. It sounds from the questions and position you interviews had,
that they are not looking for something else, and are not open to CSLA.
I came to this realization myself the hard way with my client (and not
happily). But since doing so, I looked for other direction. And now
have an offshore company working for me on one of my own product ideas
using CSLA. And if all goes well, in 12 months I can start selling it
and I can move on and spend all my time working with CSLA.<br>
<br>
Bottomline, if your company is open to cosnidering CSLA carry on
gathering evidence, but if its not, put your head down and carrying on
developing with it as long as you can, its a great product, and if you
get a few applications done, then you may just get to keep using it to
maintain those applications.<br>

Cheer,<br>
