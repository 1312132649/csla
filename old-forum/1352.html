Since I cant stop what i have and it would take forever to re-write the whole solution and migrate completedly, I wanted to run both at the same time.</P>
<P>I have already&nbsp;implemented most of the BO classes and some UI&nbsp;in CSLA 2.0 standard, but the UI will take forever to finish entirely.</P>
<P>I am wondering if there is any way to keep a user logged in while i switch along the websites, 1.1 &lt;-&gt; 2.0. One example would be while in the Admin website: I could have the product&nbsp;management in vesrion 1.1 while the customer management is in version 2.0;&nbsp;while sharing the same Database.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
