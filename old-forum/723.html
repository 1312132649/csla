<P>1. why is there an association b.w deptt and DrawingCategries(DCs)? I mean, a DC is related to a Drawing, so by putting the a list of DCs in Deptt object you will have duplicate DC objects in the Deptt object&nbsp;as: (i) DC objects in the DC List (ii) DC object in each drawing object in the Drawing objects list. Is DC is also categorised deptt wise? Same thing with StdQualification objects.</P>
<P>2. Each project has a JobScope and an Estimate. Now each estimate references a Job Scope object. I think there is a redundancy here if i am getting it correctly. There is no need for a JobScope to be associated with a Project directly when it is inside an Estimate already.</P>
<P>Tell me if my points make sense.</P>

<P>For each Department, there may be several Areas, each of which has its own Drawing Categories.&nbsp; The DrawingCategoryID for these consists of one alpha and three numerical characters, with the alpha character representing the Area.&nbsp; Each Drawing object must contain a DrawingCategoryID.&nbsp; Each Department also has its own StandardQualifications, which are non-Area specific.&nbsp; Each Drawing object may contain a reference to one or more StandardQualification objects; the case is also true for ProjectQualification objects.&nbsp; Because of this, I decided around 4 a.m. this morning to&nbsp;handle the Drawing object somewhat along the same&nbsp;line Rocky&nbsp;does with&nbsp;the Assignment object in PTracker.</P>
<P>I've also decided to make JobScope part of the Project object.&nbsp; As originaly designed, in dBase III/IV, the job scope could be modified by anyone having write privileges regardless of what Department they were in.&nbsp; Thus, someone in Architectural could make an entry for the job scope and someone else in Machine Design or Piping could come back and edit/delete/overwrite what had been entered.&nbsp; Definitely a flawed design.&nbsp; So I'm now going to allow only Project Managers and their superiors access to this field.&nbsp; I'm also going to handle ProjectQualifications pretty much the same way.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 26, 2006</h2><P>I strongly suggest designing your objects based around your use cases, not your data. You do not appear to be describing objects in terms of their responsibilities or roles in a use case, but rather in terms of their data relationships - and this is a recipie for a lot of pain later.</P>
<P>You should be thinking about all the various scenarios through which users will interact with your system. Each of them is likely a use case. Beneath each user interaction is a "business use case", which reflects that actual business task the user is trying to accomplish.</P>
<P>Implementing a business use case (not the user scenario - because that often has UI components) requires objects. Each concept and step in the use case should be represented by an object, and each of those objects should have exactly one responsibility.</P>
<P>Chapter 6 should give you some more informatoin on this way of approaching the design task.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
