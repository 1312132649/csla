You won't be able to compile it, as the framework itself is C# only now (although there is a community effort to port to VB, but it's not complete), but your VB application can use it without issue.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jender624 replied on Thursday, January 29, 2009</h2>Ok, great...Thanks!<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jender624 replied on Friday, January 30, 2009</h2>Actually, one more question...is it possible to get the built CSLA.dll framework file, instead of downloading the framework project and having to build it yourself?&nbsp; I'm finding that when I try to load the cslavb.sln solution in VB 2008 that it does not completely load, I'm guessing because of some C# code.&nbsp; <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Friday, January 30, 2009</h2><P>FYI - the VB version of CSLA 3.6 is not complete yet. See another thread in this forum for more info. It is a community project. They just got it so it will compile but many methods are stubbed out with 'TODO in them.</P>
<P>Bottom line recommendation:</P>
<P>Download the C# version, compile it once with your private key (.snk file) and copy the .dll to your VB project and just reference that.</P>
<P>I use VB but I doubt I will ever use the unofficial version for CSLA for my real projects. I would download it so I could review it and read it better. More of a&nbsp;reference.</P>
<P>I think you should do the same.</P>

<P>But you should create your own .snk file (see Google) and then in the Project Properties Signature tab, click the dropdown with the .snk and then choose &lt;Browse&gt;... to select your .snk file instead. Then just compile.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
