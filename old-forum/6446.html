<P>So the idea is that each field get a validation rule that requires its existance and when one is populated, the others validation rule is "removed".&nbsp;&nbsp; However I cannot figure out how to do this.</P>
<P>I am used to objects having Add and Remove, Open and Close and other orthogonal concecpts.&nbsp; However I cannot figure out how to remove a validation rule once you add it.</P>
<P>Any help would be appreciated.</P>

<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Tuesday, February 17, 2009</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>You wouldn't remove&nbsp;a rule - you would create a custom rule method within your BO that checks both property values.&nbsp; Then you can add the rule to both properties (or possibly use the dependency system), and the validation system should take care of&nbsp;the rest.</FONT></P>
