<p>On PTracker we have unit of work pattern examples of <strong>Creator </strong>and <strong>Getter</strong>. Those are&nbsp;ReadOnly&nbsp;collections.&nbsp;This is a way to make sure a given set of objects is present at a given time and it&#39;s most important in asynchronous scenarios. Otherwise I risk to have an object to edit but not having all the NameValueList needed to populate the combo boxes for that object. (BTW, CslaGenFork has a UnitOfWork object type with the implementation of Getter ready and Creator well advanced).</p>
<p>On <em><strong>Using Csla 4</strong></em> ebooks samples we also an <strong>Updater</strong>. This is a CommandBase object that transactionally updates two or more objects. It&#39;s a &quot;all or nothing&quot; strategy: if&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t succeed to&nbsp;update all of them, it doesn&#39;t update anything at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is missing is a <strong>Deleter </strong>example. If&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t succeed to&nbsp;delete all of them, it doesn&#39;t delete anything at all.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, May 01, 2011</h2><p>Delete is no different from update right? Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Just in the DataPortal_Execute you&#39;d make calls to delete each root object instead of to update each root object - using immediate or deferred deletion, depending on the model supported by each root.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
