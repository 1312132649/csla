Could the Navigator.CreateAndShowControl() method be modified to call Dispose on the old content before assigning the new? Like this:</P>
<P>Old:</P><PRE>ContentPlaceholder.Content = newControl;</PRE>
<P>New:</P><PRE>if (ContentPlaceholder.Content is IDisposable)
  (ContentPlaceholder.Content as IDisposable).Dispose();
ContentPlaceholder.Content = newControl;</PRE>
<P>This should be a non-breaking change.</P>

<P>Specifically I don't like that particular approach, because it would prevent someone from maintaining a dictionary of "already open" items. In other words, blindly destroying view objects may help you, but may totally block other valuable UI models.</P>
<P>So what we probably need is a way for Navigator to notify you that a view is about to be "closed" so you can call dispose, or put it into your open-items list or whatever.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
