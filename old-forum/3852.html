<P>My name is Oscar and from the south of Italy&nbsp;=(&nbsp;I can tell that I'm quite new in CSLA. And as far as the book goes (Professional C# Business Objects 2005), it looks so interesting that I'm getting involved more and more every day. And I'd love to take the CSLA into practice. Unfortunately&nbsp;haven't had the time to surf Rokcy's Website, because the only chance to get&nbsp;connected to internet is during the working&nbsp;hours, therefore I'm&nbsp;quite&nbsp;under supervision. Here the mentality is very particular...( Rather Old and stupid&nbsp;than&nbsp;New and smart !!!&nbsp;).</P>
<P>Anyways Since started reading the book I haven't been able to put to work the Project Tracker application. Is there any quick start guidance that I can read before I finish reading the book ?</P>
<P>Thank you everyone...</P>
