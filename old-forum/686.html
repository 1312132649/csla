I do this all the time and don't have a problem, so there's something different in your implementation that's causing the issue.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vargasbo replied on Monday, July 24, 2006</h2>I solved the issue. The issue was this. I have a customer, when the customer load, it loads one level deep, in this case, it loads the customer - &gt; units. When I click on my unit page, I follow the same pattern. The issue was that when I click on Unit, it reload unit and subscription, but "this" was still set to the first item in the collection, hence, why the first item kept repeating.<br><br>Thanks for the help.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
