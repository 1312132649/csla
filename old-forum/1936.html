<P>I have a Windows Forms UI that will always use remoting.&nbsp; The UI needs to support the concept of Connecting and Disconnecting to different&nbsp;servers (DataPortals).&nbsp; To support this, when a user goes to Connect/Login they enter their Username, Password, and Server (URL).</P>
<P>I was hoping I would not need to modify the framework to make this work, but I can't think of any other way.&nbsp; Does anyone have any other suggestions?</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR>Tony</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>albruan replied on Friday, December 08, 2006</h2><P>Have you taken a look at this thread?&nbsp; <A HREF="/forums/thread/3328.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/3328.aspx</A></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Friday, December 08, 2006</h2>You can have a list of dataportal urls in the app.config or elsewhere that you can control. Then when the app starts or when you need to change the url you do:<br><br>System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("CslaDataPortalUrl") = "The new url"<br><br>I've done that recently and it works just fine.<br>I also had to build a very simple dataportal proxy that simply reroutes the calls to a remoting or simple dataportal depending on a state variable. I just implement IDataPortalProxy and cache both a simple and a remoting proxy, when Fetch / Create /etc gets called, I call the corresponding method in either one of them.<br><br>All you have to do for csla to use this custom proxy is do this in the app.config:<br><br>&lt;add key="CslaDataPortalProxy"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; value="NameSpace.CustomDataPortalProxy, AssemblyName"/&gt;<br><br>But by the looks of it, solution #1 is all you need. Solution #2 has a different target and needs of #1 if you use different dataportal urls anyway...<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Tony Reece replied on Tuesday, December 12, 2006</h2><P>Thanks for the help...</P>
<P>albruan - Yes, I saw that post.&nbsp; It just seemed like there should be an easier way.</P>
<P>Andres - I think solution # 1 is all that I need.&nbsp; I will do some testing and see what happens.</P>
<P>Thanks again,<BR>Tony<BR></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
