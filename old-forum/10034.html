<p>1) As far as I understoof this means the DataPortal model to use is Factory Implementation (or Factory Invocation).</p>
<p>2) This solution is related to Silverlight and WP7 applications that are exposed to the outside world. The intention is to avoid database server access from the DMZ. The question is: how about ASP.NET (and ASP MVC) applications exposed to the outside world?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, February 06, 2011</h2><p>1) You can use encapsulated or factory data portal models on the app server. The use of MobileFactory only affects how the code runs on the web server as it handles inbound requests from a Silverlight or WP7 client.</p>
<p>2) In an ASP.NET web application environment all you need is a 3-tier deployment to move data access onto an application server. Just configure the web server to talk to an app server behind your internal firewall.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
