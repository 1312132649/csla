<p>We are thinking about mirroring our SQL Server. In that case a retry mechanism for our database commands (retry to the failover server) is needed, when an action on the primary database server fails. </p>
<p>Do we have to change our code of all DataPortal_Fetch methods, to try/catch/retry the database actions ourselves, or is there already built-in CSLA functionality to accomplish this?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your help!</p>
<p>Kind greetings,</p>

<p>I would recommend implementing a formal data access layer that your DataPortal_XYZ methods can invoke. That DAL can then abstract concepts like retry so the invocation code in the DP_XYZ methods remain focused on interacting with the state of the business object.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Joentje replied on Thursday, February 10, 2011</h2><p>Rocky,</p>
