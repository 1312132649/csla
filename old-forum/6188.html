The idea is that the actual CodeSmith templates can't map a BO to more than one table, while the EF designer can. So eventually it will be possible to create BOs that map to more than one table.<br><br>Before I can make any real progress, I need to have actual working code samples that encompass the different CSLA object prototypes.<br><br>I've done some basic tests, and they seem to work, but I'd like to hear from people who have actually implemented EF in their own BOs. That way I'll be able to create more robusts templates.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
