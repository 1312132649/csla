<p>I apologize ahead of time if this has been covered on this forum.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t seem to find it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Depending on what version of CSLA you are using, this can be done as an attribute (e.g. DataAnnotations) or via a standard CSLA custom rule.</p>
<p>If you need any more assistance, please feel free to ask and I can post some code samples.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
