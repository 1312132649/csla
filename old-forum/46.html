<P>When I had that problem 3 weeks ago,&nbsp;one had to call Microsoft before one could get the hotfix.&nbsp; I had to wait a day since the latest fix was hot just getting off the press.&nbsp; But the phone call and the wait was worth every penny because I have not had a single crash since.&nbsp; There may be some other unannounced enhancements too. Make that call.</P>
