<p>I know, winforms is an outdated technology, but I&#39;ve got to struggle with it.</p>
<p>My object is presented on a form with one of it&#39;s props beeing shown through&nbsp;a combobox. So far so good. When showing&nbsp;already db-persisted&nbsp;objects, all goes fine and it shows the correct values (quite not until I first bound the object and then the combobox&#39;s list, of course).</p>
<p>Trouble starts, when I create a new object. While there is a value choosen in the box, the objects property remains empty<img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry" /></p>
<p>What do I have to do to REALLY bind the property?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>

<p>If you drag a combox from the datasources windows the WinForms designer will create a databinding on the Text property.&nbsp; But that&#39;s usually not what you want to do with a BO property and using a NameValueList of valid choises.</p>
<p>I&#39;d recommend to drag a ComboBox from from the Toolbox and then use the ComboBox Tasks to configure databinding.And - then make sure to set the combobox listsource before you set the datasource for your BO and make sure to unbind in the opposite order. </p>
<p>Finally - download the <a href="http://windowsclient.net/downloads/folders/applications/entry1302.aspx">DataBinding FAQ</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://windowsclient.net/downloads/folders/applications/entry1304.aspx">DataGridView FAQ</a> and<a href="http://windowsclient.net/downloads/folders/applications/entry1332.aspx"> Designer FAQ</a> from <a href="http://www.windowsclient.net%20">http://www.windowsclient.net</a>. These FAQ are essential if you are going to be successful with Windows Forms Databinding. I also recommend to use the <a href="http://windowsclient.net/blogs/faqs/default.aspx">Windows Forms FAQ </a>on the same site.</p>

There are exceptions, but typically the Value is saved to the BO and db, not the human readable Name.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>vschaak replied on Wednesday, March 10, 2010</h2><p>Hi</p>
<p>thank you for your input. I&#39;ve got to admit that I feel somehow sheepish about the real reason: the combobox&nbsp;is the last control in tab order and pressing &#39;save&#39; just after choosing a value demands some form-validation, otherwise you&#39;ll see a selected value, but it isn&#39;t really written to the datasource<img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-10.gif" alt="Embarrassed" /></p>
<p>So my $/&euro; into the kitty...</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

Does anyone have a small sample to post?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
