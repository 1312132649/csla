<P>If I have an Address table in the db that is foreign keyed to an AddressType table.&nbsp; Should the corresponding Address object contain the AddressType Primary Key, the AddressType Value, or should it contain both?</P>
<P>I figure I'll be creating an AddressType object that is a NameValueListBase object.</P>
<P>Thanks for your help.</P>
