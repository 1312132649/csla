It is not returning any specific message (such as login failed, or wrong userID/password). Just an unhandled exception.

Odds are that you missed a step in the install doc from <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx</A>, and are missing some bit of configuration or setup around a web site or server.</P>
<P>admin/admin is a valid login. So is pm/pm and super/super for the different roles discussed in Chapter 6.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SolarEnergy replied on Friday, September 26, 2008</h2>The exception would be DataPortal.Fetch failed.<br><br>Last item in the call stack would be:<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Csla.dll!Csla.DataPortal.Fetch(object criteria = {ProjectTracker.Library.Security.PTIdentity.Criteria}) Line 173&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C#<br><br>You're probably right since I did not perform any particular installation tasks.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Charles<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
