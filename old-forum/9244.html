Here is the scenario:</p>
<p>I have a CSLA&nbsp;object which has a child collection as a property (e.g. think of a customer object with property phonenumbers, which is a collection). How on an ASP.NET page can I bind a gridview to the child collection of phonenumbers? I tried binding to a CslaDataSource, however seems like I can only bind the CslaDataSource to the main customer object, not the phonenumbers collection.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>Jav replied on Wednesday, July 21, 2010</h2><p>&quot;CslaDataSource&quot; suggests that you are likely using Csla v2.x</p>
<p>In that case you create SelectObject, InsertObject, UpdateObject and DeleteObject&nbsp;EventHandlers for you CslaDataSource.&nbsp; For example, if your CslaDataSource is named PhoneDataSource, you will have the following event handler for the SelectObject event:</p>
<p>Protected Sub PhoneDataSource_SelectObject(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Csla.Web.SelectObjectArgs) <br />&nbsp;Handles PhoneDataSource.SelectObject<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.BusinessObject = Customer.PhoneCollection<br />&nbsp;End Sub</p>
<p>Now when you set the gridview&#39;s DataSource to PhoneDataSource, the gridview will display the phone numbers.&nbsp; Similarly you will need to create the event handlers for the other three events so that you can send the inserts and&nbsp;updates to the database.</p>
