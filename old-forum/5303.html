<P>We are developing a solution at work using Csla, LINQ, Wpf, and Wcf. The solution is targeted towards supporting 10,000 users concurrently. Does anyone know of anything that we need to be aware of during development (gotchas, nice-to-know's, this-is-how)?</P>
<P>We would appreciate it if the community could share their thoughts, suggestions, potential pitfalls and the like. Thanks!</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
