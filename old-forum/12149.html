That third party calls my class libraries to perform tasks. I want my csla libraries to use the&nbsp;WcfPortal&nbsp;DAL. The problem is, the third party service runs under the local service account so it can&#39;t authenticate on the domain. Whenever my business objects are called the dataportal rejects them with a not authorized exception. I have tried writing my own WcfPortal class using networklogin but no luck. Same error no matter what I do. Any suggestions?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, September 20, 2013</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you considered to change the service to run under a domain service account so it can authenticate itself on the call to the web server? </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
