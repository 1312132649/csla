Am I missing something?<br /><br />Many thanks,<br />Jaans</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, November 28, 2009</h2><P>TwoWay is probably not required. During some testing I did run into issues where OneWay didn't always update the UI properly - like data binding wasn't hooking up PropertyChanged as expected. In current code that doesn't appear to be required, but your mileage may vary.</P>
<P>I think some of the confusion is that in WPF the default is TwoWay, and in SL it is OneWay - which is really unfortunate...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jaans replied on Saturday, November 28, 2009</h2>OK - Thanks.<br /><br />I'll keep an eye out for it.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
