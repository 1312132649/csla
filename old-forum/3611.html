When I set a bindingsource's datasource to this object, it raises an AgumentOutOfRangeException:<br>"InvalidArgument=Value of '0' is not valid for 'SelectedIndex'.<br>Parameter name: SelectedIndex"<br>I think this is because it cannot read the count property.<br><br>Again, I don't think this exception has been a problem, but now I'm having other strange problems that seem related to this. Rather than chase my tail, I thought I'd see if anyone has found a solution to this TypeLoadException. Is it CSLA, .Net? Is this fixed in CSLA 3.0?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 28, 2007</h2>To my knowledge that exception is a Visual Studio artifact and has nothing to do with how code works at runtime. So I don't think this issue is related to issues with selected index or count values at runtime.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
