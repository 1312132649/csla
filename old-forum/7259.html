Edit and delete works fine... but the gridview doesn't seem to support a way to add a new row??<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas?  I have event handlers for the relevent csladatasource set.  Just need something simple...<br /><br />Thanks<br />Andy</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Monday, July 13, 2009</h2>I'm sure that you must have checked all these points before also but pls re-check :-<br /><br />1. AddNewCore added in child collection<br /><br />2. Constructor of collection should have Allownew to true<br /><br />3. BindingSource should allow to add new records..</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Monday, July 13, 2009</h2>1 and 2 are true, 3 isn't because this is Asp.Net, which is why I'm using CslaDataSource.  I guess I should have been more clear though.<br /><br />Searching the internet though, it seems like the asp:GridView doesn't support this easily.  Very annoying, because I don't have 3rd party controls at my disposal for this project :-/</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
