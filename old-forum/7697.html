I theoretically could use SL but i think spawning that many browser instances would fail anyway.<br /><br />I thought about creating a Windows app and adding references to the Silverlight CSLA library files but I think serialization may complain. Maybe WPF?<br /><br />So just wondering what options I have.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Jeremy<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 29, 2009</h2>I'm not entirely sure the 2 request limit exists when using WCF in Silverlight. Remember that Silverlight is an ActiveX control (on Windows) and so is only sort of running in the browser - it could easily establish more than 2 TCP requests if that's how Microsoft designed it.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>greengumby replied on Tuesday, September 29, 2009</h2>Thanks Rocky,<br /><br />I must admit I have not tested this functionality.<br /><br />Read it here though<br /><br />http://stackoverflow.com/questions/229011/aynchronous-web-server-calls-in-silverlight-and-maximum-http-connections<br /><br />I think I will take what the web says with a grain of salt and see what actually happens. :)<br /><br />Will post my results.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Jeremy<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
