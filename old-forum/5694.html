However, I am not discounting the fact that I may need to.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />cdkisa</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Wednesday, October 29, 2008</h2><P>We have this exact same set of 4 fields (different names, same use)</P>
<P>I used a combination of an 2&nbsp;interfaces and reflection. All of our BO's inherit from a class that knows how to manage the auditing functionality, but not all the BO's actually have the fields. </P>
<P>The first interface was empty, mainly designed just for testing the derived class to see if it wanted changes audited. </P>
<P>The second&nbsp;interface was optional&nbsp;is just for indicating the values of the field names if they happen to not match the default names, which was true of some of our legacy objects.</P>
<P>So, the common base class can manage updating of the fields when an object is created or changed, even though the properties themselves reside in the low level object. </P>
<P>We did this before CSLA introduced managed properties though. I suspect it would be fairly simple now to just put the properties in the common Base class. </P>
<P>I get the impression that inheritance is something of a can of worms with regards to the static property registration. Seach for "_dummy" for details. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, October 29, 2008</h2>I just have a base class which subclasses BusinessBase&lt;T&gt;.&nbsp; It provides a common way for all BOs to manage this information.&nbsp; I also have an interface on my Linq classes to allow the BO to properly set fields in the database.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cdkisa replied on Wednesday, October 29, 2008</h2><FONT face=Arial>
<P>Thanks for the quick replies!!</P>
<P>To subclass would look something like this right (using generics):</P>
<P>public class MyBusinessBase&lt;T&gt; : BusinessBase&lt;MyBusinessBase&lt;T&gt;&gt; <BR>{ <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private string _whoCreated; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private SmartDate _whenCreated; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private string _whoLastChanged; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private SmartDate _whoLastChanged; <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public string WhoCreated{ get; set; } <BR><BR>etc... <BR>} </P>
<P>Cheers,</P>

<P>public class MyBusinessBase&lt;T&gt; : BusinessBase&lt;T&gt;&nbsp; where T: MyBusinessBase&lt;T&gt;</P>
<P>For example, you want the "Save" method in BusinessBase&lt;T&gt; to return a T, not MyBusinessBase&lt;T&gt;.</P>
<P>And since this declaration constrains T to be a MyBusinessBase&lt;T&gt;, you have the "is a" relationship between your base and derived classes properly established so BusinessBase will accept T as a generic parameter.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
