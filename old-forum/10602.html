<p>Just make sure to not keep any state on the webserver and users can hit any of them in a load balanced environment. </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>amir.gheibi replied on Tuesday, August 09, 2011</h2><p>Thanks for the reply. I believe there is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>What I need to setup is a single web server (one ASP.NET application running on it) with multiple (load-balanced) application servers.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, August 09, 2011</h2><p>Jonny&#39;s answer still applies in most cases. A typical application server is accessed via WCF using http or tcp. Of course http uses tcp - so in almost every case the application server is accessed via tcp.</p>
<p>So put a TCP load balancing appliance between the web server and the application server cluster and it just works.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>amir.gheibi replied on Wednesday, August 10, 2011</h2><p>Thanks Rocky. Let me see if I understand correctly. I put a load-balancer in front of my app servers and configure my web application to connect to that which will redirect the requests to one of the available app servers.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, August 10, 2011</h2><p>Right.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ntimothys replied on Wednesday, October 17, 2012</h2><p>Hi </p>
<p>I came across this while searching for how to have one user interface that offer interaction with multiple business applications hosted on different servers.</p>
<p>i.e. say you have a help desk and an order management system (both build using CSLA) and hosted on different servers but want to have one user interface for both without combining the two (or more) application into one application server.</p>
<p>In the project tracker, the service is located by the configuration settings - which doesn&#39;t seem to give you an option to have an application interfaec of the above nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, October 17, 2012</h2><p>There&#39;s a lot of detail in the &#39;Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration&#39; book.</p>
<p>You can set the server URL via config file, or in code by setting Csla.ApplicationContext.DataPortalUrlString</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ntimothys replied on Monday, October 22, 2012</h2><p>Thanks, I will hv a look at the book</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
