<P>I apologize if this has been asked before, but I could not find the info in any existing&nbsp;threads.&nbsp; I was just wondering if there was any time frame for a new version of CSLA compatible with .NET 3.0.&nbsp; I did see the thread in which the actual proposed name of the next CSLA was discussed (3.0 vs. 2.2 etc).&nbsp; I was wondering if any decision was made on that question as well.&nbsp; Thanks.</P>

<P>I recently downloaded the Windows SDK for .NET 3.0 and installed it, then read that I had to install the extensions for VS2005. It was really difficult to find but I found the latest one (strange the Microsoft site doesn't easily let you find the most recent download!). Anyway I installed it and it worked fine... for a while. Then, all of a sudden, my Data Sources window stopped working - wouldn't even appear - and that's pretty vital when you're working in CSLA!</P>
<P>Anyway, I solved the problem by unistalling the VS2005 extensions and then had to re-install the VS templates (there's a command line switch to do that), and my Data Sources window came back again, much to my relief.</P>
<P>It seems that the extensions to VS are for Workflow Foundation at the moment. I'm not sure there are even extensions for the other bits...</P>
<P>Anyway, just thought I'd post this in case anybody else runs into the same misery as I did!</P>
<P>Oh, and I got the WCF channel stuff from CSLA CVS and compiled it up, no problems. I have yet to test it though, but fingers crossed it will work against the RTM version of the .NET 3.0 framework.</P>

I plan to formally release a C# and VB version at some point, but I'm struggling to keep up with my schedule on the 2.1 book and just don't have time to mess with it right now.<br><br>It is true that support for DataContract/DataMember will require some deeper changes to the framework. The reason being that any use of the BinaryFormatter needs to become switchable so it can be set to use the NetDataContractSerializer instead. This is because the BinaryFormatter obviously has no knowledge of the DataContract attribute.<br><br>That change affects n-level undo and the Clone() implementations. I do not plan to make the pre-WCF data portal channels (remoting, web services, enterprise services) support DataContract. My assumption is that if you are using DataContract, you are using WCF overall.<br><br>As I say in <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?area=4&amp;id=6ae50dc6-7fa5-4568-ab53-05869f0b4dd4">the roadmap</a>, my current plan is to release the DataContract support (and hopefully some other enhancements) in early 2007.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
