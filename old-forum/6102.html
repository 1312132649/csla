Now I'd like to build a control which lets me assign users to roles. I was thinking that I'd have the user select a user and then have a checkListBox with the roles in it, and the user would check the roles he wanted that user to have, and the result would be a link table populated with users &amp; roles. What's the CSLA way of doing this?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Fintanv replied on Thursday, January 08, 2009</h2>The user child object can contain a child collection of roles.&nbsp; The roles object would contain the role name and a boolean indicating whether or not it is currently assigned to the user.<br><br>If you have not already done so I <b>highly</b> recommend getting Rocky's book.<br><br>Regards,<br>Fintan<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
