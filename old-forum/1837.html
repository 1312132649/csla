<P>like in the ptracker web application i do a login, passing username and password. In the usp ther is a second select statement which return the roles the username is in. When i debug, i see that the mRoles list object is filled with the roles from the database. </P>
<P>The problem is that when i want to do an ApplyAuthorizationRules like in the ptracker application, the IsInRole method from the custom principal object isnt called.</P>
<P>Can somebody tell me why this is. I didnt find a solution on that yet.</P>
<P>Thanks for your help in advance,</P>
<P>frank.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
