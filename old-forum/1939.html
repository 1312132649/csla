VS doesn't handle that well.<br>It may happen for several reasons, like renaming or removing a class that was already within your datasources.<br>Try to remove all files from the Datasources folder. You can find it inside "&lt;project path&gt;\My Project".<br>You may have to close and reopen VS after doing so.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>albruan replied on Monday, December 11, 2006</h2>That was precisely the problem.&nbsp; Thanks for the tip, Andrés!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
