<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have modified the CodeSmith templates to generate code using the Enterprise Library data access application block instead of the being tied to using the SQL-specific types.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It's not perfect yet, but it has really helped me. Also I only modified the C# templates because I don't use VB.NET.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I hope no one minds me linking to my blog directly, but I discussed much more in depth about the changes made and also has the download link.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I plan to make further modifications, such as using the exception handling application block for better error handling, but I hope you find the existing templates of use.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
