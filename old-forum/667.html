Then you can use the built in TreeView which works pretty well. But I can also recommend the TreeView from telerik </FONT><A href="http://www.telerik.com"><FONT face=Arial size=2>www.telerik.com</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I had a problem with the built in treeview where I couldn't hide tree nodes but the telerik verion fixed it for me. it also has some nice features that the built in one doesn't. It also binds to SiteMapDataSource.</FONT></P>
