<P>It is ok as I have not finalized my Data Access method yet but I need to decide fairly quickly and I am using a product called CodeComplete and I also emailed Philip and asked if they are going to move to L2E.&nbsp; So, a number of questions are in the mill now.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So, is there going to be a ProjectTracker app utilizing entierely L2E to check out.</P>

The book uses an L2S DAL, as shown in the 3.6 code.</P>
<P>My primary roadblock with EF is its limitations around stored procedures. It is just radically harder to use than L2S in this regard :(</P>
<P>However, if you've been watching the blogosphere you are aware that Microsoft has given the nod to EF now, so you can expect that 3.6.1 or 3.6.2 will probably switch over to EF. </P>
<P>It is all dependent on my schedule of course, and right now all my energies are going toward getting the book out in a timely manner, and supporting Joe in getting the VB book out shortly after. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CyclingFoodmanPA replied on Wednesday, November 05, 2008</h2><P>Thanks Rocky,</P>
<P>They (Microsoft) need to slow down so you can get some breathing room!&nbsp; One thing I know for sure, sprocs are fast and efficient and I am battling with what technology to use.&nbsp; But, you mentioning that EF has limitations on sprocs is a major road block for me and I may just stick with either pure ADO.NET sprocs or L2S.</P>
<P>Thanks for all your hard work Rocky in developing an awesome framework.</P>
