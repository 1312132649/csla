Users can initiate SQL transactions and the status (pending, active, completed, failed, etc.) is displayed in the console. Each user can add 1 to many capture/restore operations. I am currently processing rows 1 at a time and persisting after each state change. However, changes persisted to the database from another user do not get displayed on another users console. I would like to refresh the list either periodically or after each row update to reflect potential changes to the db from another user.<br /><br />Question: Is there some kind of example on how best to do something like this?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, September 15, 2009</h2>You can build an instance method which does an in-place refresh of the list and call it every so often... or you can fetch the list again every so often and bind to the new list.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
