<p>I have a BusinessBase&nbsp;object that requires the selection of a value from a combo box control populated with a list of items from a NameValueListBase object.&nbsp; The property on the BusinessBase object is defined as a Long.&nbsp; This means that this value defaults to a 0 and thus always has a value.&nbsp; While using data binding, if a user selects an option from the combo box and then clears the combo box the binding source object is trying to set my Long property to NULL, which causes a NULL to Long conversion&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>Should the IdProperty be implemented as a Long type, or should a different type be used that accepts the use of a NULL value?&nbsp; At times, Id&nbsp;properties should allow the use of NULL values.&nbsp; What type should be used to allow the user to insert NULL Id values into a database?&nbsp; Also, since a long type always has a value (default of 0) the common Required rule never works.&nbsp; It seems like the Long data type is not the correct type to use.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
