<P>I would like to be able to get property metadata like IsDirty in a business rule to validate someone has changed it prior to running the rule logic.&nbsp; I am using CSLA 3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>At one point I was using </P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff>Csla.Core.FieldManager.IFieldData dataPointValue = target.FieldManager.GetFieldData(DataPointValueProperty);</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff>if (dataPointValueIsDirty)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff>...</FONT></P>
<P>But that seems to have been removed in the latest version of 3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this something the business rule already knows and doesn't fire if the property hasn't been changed?</P>
<P>A scenario would be someone unchecks a checkbox in the UI, the business rule checks to see if you can set that property to false based on business logic related to other fields in the DB.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>

<P>Exposing the FieldData object like I did in the beta was a problem because it allowed outside code to change the FieldData object's values - and that would have been a mess.</P>
<P>But in restricting access to the object I missed the fact that the IsDirty value needs to be available <img src="/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad [:(]" /></P>
<P>Once I get done with my current bit of non-stop travel I'll address this, probably in a 3.5.2 version.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
