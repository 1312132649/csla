I am very interested to find out what most people would prefer in terms of a delivery/pricing model, so please consider answering this poll.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently looking at about 7 smaller PDF ebooks, and 3-4 video series (Core CSLA 4, Silverlight, WPF, ASP.NET MVC).</p>
<p>So this poll is less about what I&#39;m going to create than how I&#39;m going to organize it. Do you prefer to buy individual PDF/video content, or buy related content as a package? Or buy access to future content as a big unit?</p>
<p>Thank you for your input!</p>
