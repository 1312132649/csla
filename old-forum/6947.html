After changing the Framework to 3.5, I am noticing a strange problem. My GridViews that attach to CslaDataSource using a collection based on CslaBusinessListBase fail to display at Design time with the following error:<br />"There was an error rendering the control. GenericArgument[1], '........Phone', on CslaBusinessListBase'2[T,C] violates the constraint of type parameter 'C'."<br /><br />The business objects and collections continue to compile as before.  At runtime the GridViews display okay and possibly behave okay but I am not sure (It was the erratic behavior that brought me to work on the design in the first place).<br /><br />Any hints would be appreciated.<br /><br />Javed</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
