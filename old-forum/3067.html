<p class="MsoNormal">Instead of using another decorator to decorate your LineItem
class, you could use the strategy pattern on the print function in the LineItem
class.<span>&nbsp; </span>One print function would print
the amount while the other wouldnâ€™t.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, June 26, 2007</h2>That would make it available to ever line item within any document type... which is really the part I'm trying to grapple with.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>malloc1024 replied on Tuesday, June 26, 2007</h2>You could allow all line items to hide their price but only allow the user to hide the price of a line item that belongs to a RMA document through the user interface.  You don't need to give the user a way to hide line items through the user interface for other documents.  I am assuming that you would like to enforce this rule in your business layer.  If so, the document object is responisble for enforcing it.  It could check to see if all line items are displaying their price before it prints the document.  If a few line items are not displaying their price, the document object can change the line item to display their price or throw an exception.  If a line item doesn't have a price, and it is told to print a price, it would print a blank line.  </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
