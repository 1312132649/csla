Instead, I expect the app to hit our remote DP on the DMZ, which in turn would talk to our internal app server behind the firewall. So it is a 4-tier deployment. In in this context, will I have access to their identify when sending requests to the remote DP?</p>
<p>In other words, can I utilize ApplicationContext.User in the domain-joined WinRT world? Or should I expect to require the user to enter his credentials in the app itself and pass them (over https) with every call to the remote DP for authentication on the server? Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 13, 2014</h2><p>I don&#39;t know the answer for sure, but I am doubtful that the credentials will flow from the client to the server in your scenario.</p>
<p>In fact, given a 4-tier model, I&#39;m quite certain they won&#39;t, because NTFS only flows credentials over one hop.</p>
<p>So you could almost certainly get them to flow from client to the initial web server by setting the data portal endpoint to require NTFS/Windows security, and setting the client&#39;s WCF proxy to pass the user&#39;s credentials. But the credentials won&#39;t flow past the web server because that was your one hop.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Friday, June 13, 2014</h2><p>Thanks, Rocky. I had forgotten about the multiple network hops in this circumstance. I think our network folks might have enabled Kerberos, but even then I don&#39;t know if our web server (in the DMZ) is a part of the corporate domain.</p>
<p>Sounds like I might need to just plan on capturing the user&#39;s credentials within the app and pass that with each call. I assume I can do this using ApplicationContext.ClientContext.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
