<p>I am new to CSLA and I am trying to implement CSLA 2008 in our project. I read that separating Business Object&nbsp;and Data Access is good design pattern thats why I have created two separate layer for Business logic and Data access logic. My DAL object just consist of CRUD methods&nbsp;which&nbsp;opens databse conection executes stored procedure&nbsp;command and loads DTO object.&nbsp;These two layers communicate with each other by transfering simple DTOs which are simple objects containing just a property.</p>
<p>So now my question is how can I use DAL and DTO with Different BO like BusinessBase and BusinessListBase with Child object scenario ?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
