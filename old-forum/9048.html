<p>Are there any limitations in CSLA that would restrict me from continuing to use this process?&nbsp; How would I go about passing this dynamically retrieved connection string to the CSLA framework?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Then just put the connection string in Csla.ApplicationContext.ClientContext to make it available (automatically) to all your code.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
