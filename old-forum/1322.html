As changes are made to the collection, they are <i>immediately</i> applied to the objects it contains. In other words, remove an item from the collection, and that item immediately deletes itself from the database. Update an item's data in the collection, and that item is immediately saved to the database (the "child" object's Save() method is called).<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vbdotnetguy replied on Monday, September 25, 2006</h2>Thanks Rocky!&nbsp; I was just coming back to mark this post resolved as I got it figured out, by doing want you suggested.&nbsp; Just jumped the gun a little to quick.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
