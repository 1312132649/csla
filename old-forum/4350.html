But I do plan to make one a "project tracker ce" if you will.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>yjoe replied on Monday, February 18, 2008</h2>Project Tracker CE is a very cool idea. I am sure many CSLA CE fans are waiting for this solution example. Thanks very much in advance.&nbsp;</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jarlife replied on Wednesday, November 18, 2009</h2>Has there been any movement on CSLA CE? <br /><br />Is anybody using it? <br /><br />Would anyone benefit from framework development and example applications / documentation?<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dsader replied on Saturday, November 21, 2009</h2>I would definitely benefit from these.<br /><br />I'm trying to develop applications for mobile devices that will connect with an application server developed using CSLA.net. <br /><br />I need to know if the CSLACE.net is a good choice to do that.<br /><br />Your assistance is highly appreciated.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jarlife replied on Friday, November 27, 2009</h2>There are a few fundamental features missing from the compact framework, which means more coding in the CSLA business objects. It took us much longer to build our first app in the absence of example code. <br /><br />The framework is still CSLA, so all the benefits transfer to CE. <br /><br />I'm looking to tidy up the sample app and share in the next few weeks.<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Indyy66 replied on Sunday, January 03, 2010</h2>I am also interested in the CSLA.NET CE version. I would like to incorporate this into my CSLA applications and promote Windows mobile development.<br /><br />Thanks,</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
