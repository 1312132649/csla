The datasets are populated by a tableadaptors fill methods which call stored procedures. </P>
<P>I found the whole procedural to OOPS and CSLA learning curve a little overwhelming at the beginning and opted to use datasets instead of using business objects for the report datasource.</P>
<P>Currently the application is functioning in a 2 tier environment. Is is possible to upgrade to 3 tier given and retain the use of datasets and sprocs an if so what is the general approach.</P>
<P>Any advice is appreciated. </P>
<P>Thanks </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, December 24, 2008</h2><P>Yes - I think you can do it.</P>
<P>I have 1 or 2 BOs that simply contain a variable declared as a Dataset (or DataTable). Since either is serializable as of .Net 2.0, you can have the BO contain the dataset, use the CSLA framework to move the object from the client to the server and back and then just use the read only property that exposes the dataset.</P>
