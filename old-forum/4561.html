<P>I'm fairly new to this stuff so I'm trying to take small steps and not get confused/overwhelmed.</P>
<P>Any quick advice?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2><P>I have been using 2.1.4 with VS 2005 for about a year now. It is fine for ASP.Net.</P>
<P>I understand the 3.x versions have some major Winforms databinding fixes. So if you need that then you should make the jump.</P>
<P>Read the eBooks before moving ahead and peruse some of the older threads in this forum too.</P>
<P>I have plans to jump to 3.5 later this year when it is out of Beta.</P>
<P>The code changes from 1.x to 2.x were huge. It took my entire team almost a month to fix up all the BOs and pages. A quick look at 3.x shows that the required changes are minimal and things should "just work". I need to do more in depth study though. If we later want to use some of the new features (like all the Property code reduction Rocky worked so hard on) then we can optionally switch over for new BOs. And later go back and re-generate&nbsp;older BOs. But I don't envision major changes right away as we have tons of work ahead of us.</P>

<P>Thanks as always for the quick reply.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, March 26, 2008</h2><P>Then you should plan on moving to 3.5.</P>
<P>You can begin while the code is in Beta as it is fairly solid. But you have to expect to update the CSLA.dll when the final release occurs.</P>
<P>You do not have to use the new features - you&nbsp; can work into them later if you want to.</P>
<P>I think the original Property code is simpler to understand&nbsp;and code. But I have not worked with the new stuff yet. I realize it has some additional potential that can be exploited if necessary. It can be learned over time.</P>
