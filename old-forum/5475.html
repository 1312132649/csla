<P>Now that SL2 RC0 is out, is there any impact on the artist formerly know as "CSLA Light"? I would like to upgrade ASAP and was wondering if there will be a new SL2 RC0 compatible CSLA code base? </P>
<P>As always thanks!</P>

<P>The bits currently in svn should be compatible with RC0. We've been working this week to prep for the RC0 release, and all <EM>should</EM> be good. </P>
<P>We're doing testing in the final RC0 release, with the intent of putting out CSLA .NET for Silverlight Beta 1 later today or this weekend.</P>
<P>(and no, the pre-RC0 bits won't work directly on RC0 due to some breaking changes in Silverlight)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
