It might work to use IIS/HTTP compression, though that doesn't work with all technologies and I haven't tried it with WCF to Silverlight. And it would work to go purchase a compressed WCF channel as well - I know there are some for .NET, and I assume there might be some for Silverlight as well?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dkdeveloper replied on Monday, September 14, 2009</h2>thanks for the answer.<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
