<P>You might try subclassing CslaDataProvider to add a SelectedValue dependency property that you <EM>can</EM> bind to from the combobox. Or you might find that switching to a viewmodel approach is simpler than the data provider approach for things like this, though I think adding a property to a CslaDataProvider subclass is a fine solution.</P>
<P>Just handle the case where the property changes (not in the setter - that doesn't always run - but in the static property registration code), and when the property changes have your code in the data provider set the factory parameter collection and call Refresh().</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DancesWithBamboo replied on Thursday, November 05, 2009</h2>Thanks Rocky for the subclassing suggestion--hadn't thought of that.&nbsp; Somehow I just knew "code" was going to be the answer.&nbsp; Seems like the xaml and binding in SL 3 still isn't quite there yet.&nbsp; I haven't embraced mvvm (not sure it will fit in my head) yet so I am going with the dataprovider method at least for now.<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
