<P>Make sure you read the Change Log document before going too far. I've tried to list all breaking changes as a summary at the top, with my estimate on the likely impact of each one. You can find more details further into the document.</P>
<P>There will be no more functional changes to 2.1, so this download is complete. There obviously could be bugs, but enough people have been helping me find issues with the last couple pre-releases that I think it is pretty stable at this point.</P>
<P>Barring anyone finding a major issue, I am still planning to release 2.1 by the end of September, so if you have any near-term plans to use 2.1 I <EM>strongly</EM> recommend trying this beta version <EM>on a non-production copy</EM> of your project over the next 10 days or so. That will allow you to provide me with any bug reports in enough time that I can try and address them.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Wednesday, September 13, 2006</h2><P>Am I incorrect in thinking that I should be getting compile errors if I haven't changed some of my custom validation errors to be static? </P>
<P>I've been going through my classes and still have a few classes with instance validation rules being used with AddRule, and compiling it seems to work just fine.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Perhaps I misunderstood what the compiler was going to complain about but I thought I'd mention it. I just grabbed the latest&nbsp;2.1 a moment ago.&nbsp; </P>

Yep, you're right. Thanks. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 14, 2006</h2>Yeah, I <EM>wish</EM> I could do compile-time checking of this issue, but I had to settle for a runtime check.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pvanroos replied on Thursday, September 14, 2006</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>I've been playing around with the beta (2.1).&nbsp; I just wanted to say I like it--especially how you have augmented the ValidationRules functionality.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
