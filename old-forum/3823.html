<P>We at first thought that we needed this in our application, but have since changed to thinking that the server side operations need to be quick atomic operations (e.g. database transactions for the most part).&nbsp; </P>
<P>We are moving things that used to require callback-like capability in the middle of these operations to validation rules or other processing done client-side before the server-side process is invoked. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Friday, November 02, 2007</h2><P>What environment are you trying to do this in?&nbsp; Windows Forms or Web?</P>
<P>And what client functionality are you trying to achieve?</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
