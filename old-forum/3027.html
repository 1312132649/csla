<P>Could you explain us what DynamicRoot class&nbsp;is for exactly?</P>
<P>thank you</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, June 12, 2007</h2><P>That template is for use with the DynamicRootList template and shows how to construct objects that work with the new EditableRootListBase base class. </P>
<P>EditableRootListBase is designed to support Windows Forms in-place data binding, where you want each row's data (each object) to save/remove itself <EM>immediately</EM> as the user acts on that row. When the user leaves a row, the underlying object is inserted or updated. If the user removes a row, the underlying object is immediately deleted.</P>
<P>You can get more details about EditableRootListBase and how to use it from the <A href="http://www.store.lhotka.net">CSLA .NET Version 2.1. Handbook</A>.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
