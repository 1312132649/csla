<p>I&#39;m using clsa4, wpf, mvvm with bxf. I have readonly child list that i want to sort and filter in various way. What&#39;s the best way? I&#39;m currently using LINQ to&nbsp;bind an&nbsp;IEnummerable list from&nbsp;my view model and leaving the readonly csla child list in the viewmodel. This seems totally wrong as i feel I should be creating a view onto my source, I know wpf has a collectoionview source with a view property but to take full control I would have to do code behind. Any advice is welcome.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Wednesday, December 21, 2011</h2><p>You can create a public dependency property on your view model that returns a sorted IEnumerable list from the readonly child list.&nbsp; In your view you could either bind directly to that ViewModel property or to a collectionviewsource that is bound to it.&nbsp; No need for code behind.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
