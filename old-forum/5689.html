<P>It would be nice if this could be done with minimal overhead. You have an internal IManagedProperties interface and BusinessBase efficiently implements&nbsp;the desired HasManagedProperties function but since it's internal I can't use it.</P>
<P>A protected BusinessBase member would be fine. :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Ash002 replied on Tuesday, October 28, 2008</h2>Hi, also is it possible to expose FieldManager.GetRegisteredProperties() in a way that doesn't require an instance of the business object? Currently we simply create a new instance to access our list of PropertyInfos, which are overridden to store some meta data.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Ashley<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
