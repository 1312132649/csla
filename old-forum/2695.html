<P>In the process of writing a common SmartFieldRequired rule, I mentioned to my colleage Charlie that we could assign an interface, ISmartField to the classes, and our rule could cast the object parameter coming in as the ISmartField interface.</P>
<P>Charlie hadn't worked with Interfaces before, and his whole face showed the mental confusion.&nbsp; If you've ever tried to change gears on a manual stick shift, and the gears aren't meshing, just grinding, you have the knowledge to recognize his expression. :)</P>
<P>So, I'm thinking, how can I make this easily understandable?</P>
<P>"Ok, Charlie, a beautiful woman walks into our area, sits at the empty desk next to you, and introduces herself as a new team-member.&nbsp; At that point, you cast her from the PrettyWoman class to the IColleague interface, and you deal with her in her aspect of colleague."</P>
<P>"Ok, Dave, I get it!"&nbsp; Pause.&nbsp; "But you are objectifying women!"</P>
