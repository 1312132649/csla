<p>I have a question about best practices -&nbsp; We have a CSLA based web app,&nbsp; that stores information in a session while the user works, through multiple pages, before saving to db.</p>
<p>I have corrected a bug in the system,&nbsp; but have a question on what CSLA experts recommend as a best practice.</p>
<p>**Background<br />my app works with surety bonds, each Bond has a Broker, and each Broker has a BrokerId (and many other fields also)</p>
<p>So we end up with code like this-</p>
<p>**example code*****</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; if (SessionValue.CurrentADUser.IsAdmin)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;SessionValue.CurrentRequest.Bond.BrokerId = 1; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
<p>**example code*****</p>
<p>Other sections of the code refer to these brokerId a different way, by not using a foreign key i.e&nbsp; &quot;CurrentRequest.Bond.Broker.BrokerId&quot;&nbsp; instead of&nbsp; &quot;CurrentRequest.Bond.BrokerId&quot;</p>
<p><br />I have been tasked with finding out if using foreign keys in this manner is: A. Safe and B.&nbsp; recommended by CSLA as a best practice.?</p>
<p>Can someone please shed some light if this technique is a big no-no/ not recommended?&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p>
