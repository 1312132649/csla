<P>So is there a way to get a functionality like<BR>user.IsInRole("Design%") or user.IsInRole("Design*")? The closest I came was building a new object. I don't want to do that. I'd rather use&nbsp;IPrincipal. I'm listing all of the involved roles in the class now and it's a mess.</P>
<P>I don't think there is, but I'm investigating first. Didn't find anything in the old forum or in TechNet or MSDN. I'm also looking into team-based security where if you're not in the team, you cannot edit the project, but I can just iterate through the child collection and see if there's a match (ResourceID) or not.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>I'm still&nbsp;testing&nbsp;the roles and code we need, but I believe I'll have the Security db under my control in the next week so I can do these kinds of changes. I just didn't like spelling them out in the code. Turns one if statement into lots&nbsp;of lines. Still the custom IPrincipal became local when logged in so it's pretty fast (no ActiveDirectory crap).</P>
<P>I launched a training needs&nbsp; db w/CSLA about 3 weeks ago and (surprise) I've got loads of requests for more development. That means I'll *try* to put all this stuff into a uniform structure with meaningful&nbsp;titles. What a concept. It's like code pearls&nbsp;before swine.</P>
<P>Thanks for the reply...</P>
