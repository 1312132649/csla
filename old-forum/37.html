<P><FONT face="Arial Unicode MS">We have an extreme big project has just been kicked-off; choosing which distributed technology to separate tiers became a big challenge.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial Unicode MS">One of the choices is just using SOAP Xml Web Service + WSE to construct a sort of Service-Orientated-Architecture. Another choice is using CSLA to provide more flexible deployment options. <o:p></o:p></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial Unicode MS">Here I have 3 concerns with CSLA. Can any of you give some advice?<o:p></o:p></FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI class=MsoNormal>Ultimately WCF (Windows Communication Foundation, called Indigo previously) will be the final standard of .NET-distributed technology. What is the future of CSLA? <o:p></o:p></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal>From interface <SPAN>IDataPortalServer</SPAN><SPAN>, probably I can tell CSLA has the abstraction that business object only work under CRUD modes, but in real business application, scenario can be way more complicated. We can have more than 10 different ways to fetch same business objects, same as create or delete, isn't it right?</SPAN><o:p></o:p></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal>Is there any successful business case of using CSLA in big application in&nbsp;sectors like finance service or health care?<o:p></o:p></LI></OL>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;Forgive me just having very limited understanding of CSLA, just eager to know.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pelinville replied on Tuesday, May 09, 2006</h2><DIV>With SOA I would still wan't a good object oriented design which the services use.&nbsp; Using CSLA as a basis fo that OO design provides some real benifits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You can retrieve/create/delete the objects from the datasource&nbsp;however many ways you want depending on how you use the criteria (I am speaking from 1.x stuff here.)&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I know Rocky put alot of work in to make sure that transitioning to Indigo will be as painless as possible. He talked about this in&nbsp;his blogs, a couple of interviews I have heard and on his site.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Also on his site is some of the companies that use&nbsp;CSLA.&nbsp; (<A href="http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=a26b2727-f99d-485b-aa3e-a5466e534a2b">http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=a26b2727-f99d-485b-aa3e-a5466e534a2b</A>) </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And remember, you have the source code so you can extend and or modify it to fit your needs.</DIV>

<P>Agree with that have better object design will give real benifit for long run. But from this aspect, is there any difference of using CSLA versus other ORM tools? </P>
<P>The most attractive portion of CSLA is it provides you unified interface to access WebService Proxy, Remoting Proxy and/or local access proxy. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>johnm replied on Tuesday, May 09, 2006</h2><P>One thing I am not sure about CSLA and WCF is not if they can communicate to each other. </P>
<P><FONT size=2>My personal understanding is: </FONT>WCF has a big portion of overlapping with CSLA, the concept of Data Contract is similar with DataPortalServer, but more generic. <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/winfx/technologies/communication/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/introtowcf.asp#introt_topic11">Detail.</A></P>
<P>If I am using WCF plus another good ORM framework. Why I have to use CSLA anymore?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2><P>The point of CSLA .NET is to abstract complex .NET "plumbing" like data binding and to add extra features to your objects like validation and authorization.</P>
<P>The support for mobile objects through the use of the data portal is important, but is not (to my mind) the primary value of the framework. As others have noted, the use of thte data portal is optional and other alternatives exist. </P>
<P>The primary value of CSLA .NET is to enable the creation of business objects where you spend your time designing and implementing business code rather than plumbing code.</P>
<P>To CSLA .NET, WCF is no different from Remoting or Enterprise Services. It is an RPC (remote procedure call) technology. There is fundamentally no overlap between CSLA and WCF at all - they are designed to do entirely different things. I certainly don't view CSLA as a technology for communicating across the network (which is the purpose of WCF). Rather, CSLA is a technology that <EM>uses</EM> pre-existing technologies to communicate across the network to implement a higher-level concept called mobile objects.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>johnm replied on Friday, May 12, 2006</h2><P>Thanks Rocky, you've made the point clear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pelinville replied on Tuesday, May 09, 2006</h2><DIV>CLSA really isn't an ORM.&nbsp; I think some people use an ORM with CSLA but I haven't actually seen this in action.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I use code generation much like the book by Kathleen Dollard and many use templates with another code generation app Code Smith (I think that is what it is called).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Personally I don't even use the Dataportal any more.&nbsp; I have extended the CSLA BusinessBase and BusinessCollectionBase and use a remotable&nbsp;DAL.&nbsp; I didn't have to touch the base CSLA for this.&nbsp; I only mention this to show how flexible it is.&nbsp; I am sure the 2.0 version is even better.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Patrick replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2>Hi,<br><br>there is a framework named JCL which uses CSLA.NET in combination with an ORM tool named LLBLGen Pro.<br><ul><li>

<P>I don't see how there can be 10 different ways of loading the same business objects. </P>
<P>I am not very familiar with CSLA .net but have extensive experience with CSLA VB 6.&nbsp; My CSLA VB 6 apps are extremely scalable thanks to the CSLA architecture. If you are worried about bringing a lot of data to the client, you may have to design the app in such a way that the minimum required data is brought to the client.</P>

I recall Rocky saying something about a dataportal using wcf, but he didn't release it yet because wcf is still subject to changes. Definitely, csla will support it.<br><br>2. Actually you can have 10 different strongly typed fetch methods. This is well supported by the dataportal. It will call the correct method based on the criteria type you pass to the dataportal. (Or you can handle all in one method based on criteria parameters, but that is the old way...).<br><br>3. www.lhotka.net has a list of companies using csla.<br>Here:<br>http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=a26b2727-f99d-485b-aa3e-a5466e534a2b<br><br><br>But I'm sure he posted an updated list in his weblog. I just can't find it.<br><br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 09, 2006</h2><P>1) I already have a data portal channel that works on the FebCTP of WCF - you can find it on <A href="http://www.lhotka.net">www.lhotka.net</A> under downloads. To say that WCF is the "final standard" is a bit optimistic I think. It is very unlikely that Microsoft will quit changing their distributed technologies with WCF <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" />. Obviously however, support for WCF is important.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most important thing to realize around WCF, is that CSLA will allow you to move from using remoting, web services or enterprise services to use WCF <EM>without changing your code</EM>. At least this is true with the current WCF data portal channel, so unless Microsoft makes&nbsp;a radical and unfortunate change to WCF (basically dropping concepts needed for client/server) this will be the case.</P>
<P>2) Certainly you might have different criteria or selection schemes for your data. But it is very hard to imagine operations beyond create,fetch,insert,update and delete. These operations have been the core of data access for decades now and have been sufficient. I think what you are saying is that you have complicate criteria - and CSLA .NET supports this concept.</P>
<P>3) Someone already linked to my web site in this regard. But yes, the framework has been used in some large applications and by some large companies.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
