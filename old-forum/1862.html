As usual i rename my config file to remoteconfig file and enable the remoting statement. As i have notice in my internet temporary files. It doesn't download the remoteconfig file unlike the previous version of Csla (1.5). I know that the remoteconfig file handles the statement if you want to use .net remoting or not. Is my application uses .Net Remoting? Btw, I'm using Csla .NET 2.1.1.0<br><br>Any ideas? And also i'm having trouble in Window 2000 Server configuring my application.<br><br>Thanks<br></font></font></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, November 29, 2006</h2>Using NetRun doesn't mean you're using Remoting.&nbsp; It seems odd that your .remoteconfig file is not downloading, as I thought NetRun specifically downloaded the appropriate file.<br><br>Are you naming the file MyApp.exe.remoteconfig?<br><br>The config file is what will determine if you're using remoting or not.. but if its not downloading, you haven't even gotten that far yet.<br><br>Since you indicate you're using .Net 2.0 however, instead of NetRun I would recommend using ClickOnce installation.&nbsp; Its much more advanced than NoTouchDeployment.<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>brembot replied on Wednesday, November 29, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>ajj3085:</strong></div><div>Using NetRun doesn't mean you're using Remoting.&nbsp; It seems odd that your .remoteconfig file is not downloading, as I thought NetRun specifically downloaded the appropriate file.<br><br>Are you naming the file MyApp.exe.remoteconfig?<br><br>Andy<br></div></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>Yes, I'm using you the one you mention.

To solve this problem is to add a&nbsp;MIME type which the extension will be .remoteconfig and the mime type will be text/xml.</P>
<P>This can be done by invoking the properties in the IIS 6.0 and clicking the Mime Types button.</P>
<P>@ajj3085: Would it be possible to know where we can get good information about ClickOnce? Last time colleagues does the&nbsp;research there are also limitations in ClickOnce, correct me if I'm wrong especially dealing with registry and the only way to do that is a combination of MSI and ClickOnce which could also be complicated.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, November 30, 2006</h2>There's plenty of info if you google for clickonce.&nbsp; There are limitations, such as installs are per user only.<br><br>Modification of the registry may or may not be allowed depending on the trust level of the application.&nbsp; <br><br>You'd never have a combination of clickonce and msi, you'd choose one or the other.&nbsp; If you're doing heavy stuff, such as installing drivers (and possibly modification to HKLM) then ClickOnce isn't appropriate, but I've found it to be very capable for my Csla based application.&nbsp; <br><br>You might also want to rethink some things, like do you really need to use the registry for your application, or can your config file be used instead?&nbsp; One of the nice things is that user settings in the configuration file are kept when you release an update of your application, and so far its been very easy to deal with clickonce.<br><br>Click a link to install the application.&nbsp; Updates can be checked for before the application starts or on shutdown.&nbsp; You can require certain updates.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
