<P>Rocky has "moved on". And already released 2.0 and 2.1 for .Net 2.</P>
<P>I think 2.1 is a great place to start and plan on moving into Production with that code this week.</P>

										CSLA version. C# CSLA 1.50 for .Net 2 (check in downloads). <br><br>It is ok if there is no "oficial" release for 1.5x for .Net 2. My question to Rocky or someone who may know is, if that is the case, then what are the steps to convert 1.53 to .Net 2. Is it as simple as running
the VS upgrade wizard to run 1.53 in .Net 2? Or are other changes
required to run CSLA 1.5x with .Net 2?<br><br>Using 2.1 is not an option for us at the moment.<br><br>Thx<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, October 27, 2006</h2>I would think it should be as simple as running the conversion wizard.&nbsp; To my knowledge, there's no framework classes used by Csla that have been modified in a breaking way from 1.1 to 2.0.<br><br>I think there are unit tests also with 1.53, so convert and run the tests.&nbsp; They don't cover everything though, so be careful.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Friday, October 27, 2006</h2><P>Make a full backup first of your non-converted CSLA 1.53 first just in case.&nbsp; :)</P>
<P>I did a convertion from 1.5x to&nbsp;2x about 10 months ago and it went just fine.&nbsp; Disclaimer though, I have since moved to csla 2x.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xAvailx replied on Friday, October 27, 2006</h2>I forgot about the unit tests, I will run those and see what happens. <br><br>Thx<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Friday, October 27, 2006</h2><P>I converted my 1.x project for .Net 2.0 ( I need to run side by side for a while.)</P>
<P>I used the SortableCollectionBase that was posted in the old foruma nd it had 1 line of code that would not comple in .Net 2.0. It was for BinarySearches. Since I nver called that&nbsp; I just commented it out. So the project should convert without error if you did not customize it.</P>
