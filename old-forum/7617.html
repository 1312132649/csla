<P><STRONG>CSLA .NET 3.7.1 Beta 3</STRONG> is near-stable. In fact it would have been a release, except for one change I just added that I feel needs a beta cycle.</P>
<P>The 3.7.1 release is primarily bug fixes for a few issues in 3.7.0. </P>
<P>The only <EM>new</EM> feature is some support for creating custom FieldInfo&lt;T&gt; subclasses, which requires creating PropertyInfo&lt;T&gt; subclasses. If you are doing this, the new 3.7.1 changes in Beta 3 may make your life much easier.</P>
<P><STRONG>CSLA .NET 3.8.0 Alpha 2</STRONG> shows my continuing work and thoughts around the new Silverlight 3 binding capabilties and MVVM support.</P>
<P>All the new changes in Alpha 2 are on the Silverlight side, and impact:</P>
<UL>
<LI>CslaDataProvider - where the ObjectInstance property is now bindable, so you can "chain" data provider controls in parent-child relationships. This means you can have a child region on a form that is bound to a CslaDataProvider that got its data from the child property of a parent CslaDataProvider.<BR>
<LI>ViewModelBase - a base class that provides protected members you can use to more easily create a ViewModel class for your CSLA .NET business objects. The approach taken is one that exposes the Model (your business object) as a Model property of the ViewModel object; this is the flavor of MVVM that works best with CSLA .NET.<BR><BR>This does include a protected method to create/fetch the Model as requested in one of the recent MVVM threads on the <A href="/forums">CSLA .NET forum</A>.<BR>
<LI>ViewModel - a subclass of ViewModelBase that exposes public members for use with InvokeMethod or Execute (see below) so the methods can be invoked directly by XAML. <EM>Warning:</EM> I may or may not keep this class, depending on <EM>your feedback</EM>, as I don't know if it is the best plan overall.<BR>
<LI>InvokeMethod - which has breaking changes, but now automatically binds to the current DataContext and does a whole bunch of other nice work on your behalf to invoke methods on a data provider or ViewModel.<BR>
<LI>Execute - a new event trigger action using the new Blend 3 SDK feature of event triggers. The Execute action is similar to InvokeMethod, but works within the new event trigger infrastructure.<BR>
<LI>PropertyStatus - which has breaking changes, and is now bindable using element binding, and binds to the business object property instead of using a string literal for the property name. It also now exposes properties so a UI control can bind <EM>to PropertyStatus</EM>, instead of having PropertyStatus directly alter the UI control - this offers major new flexibility in UI design.</LI></UL>
<P>If you are using SL3 and/or are at all interested in MVVM, please take a look at what I'm doing in 3.8 and provide feedback.</P>
<P>As always, my intent is not for CSLA .NET to become a UI framework. At the same time, I feel the need to fill in at least the most glaring holes in the UI layer to enable use of CSLA .NET - and this means providing a basic way for XAML to invoke ViewModel methods, and for validation/authorization rules to be expressed in a rich manner in the UI.</P>
<P>It <EM>should be the case</EM> that any MVVM UI framework will be compatible with viewmodel objects you create by subclassing ViewModelBase. If that's not true, I'd like to hear about the issues you run into. Since ViewModelBase exposes nearly all protected members (except for Model, IsBusy and Error, which are public), I expect that it will provide an incredibly flexible start point for creating viewmodel objects.</P>
<P>The ViewModel base class is an example of how ViewModelBase can be subclasses to create a base that works with a specific UI implementation - specifically InvokeMethod and/or Execute.</P>
<P>Assuming generally positive feedback on the changes I've made on the Silverlight side, I'll port the appropriate changes to the WPF side, and then release 3.8.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, September 13, 2009</h2><P>I did put a "sample" app online too - it is rough though, as it is literally what I'm using to experiment with ideas.</P>
