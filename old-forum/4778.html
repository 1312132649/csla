With VS2008 you can easily use resx files now. Here is a thread and tip on how to use it.<br><br><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3125419&amp;SiteID=1">http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3125419&amp;SiteID=1</a><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, May 01, 2008</h2>Hm.. I tried the suggestion, but it doesn't seem to work for me.&nbsp; Maybe because my resource file is in the same assembly as the wpf window?<br><br>I'll have to find something else..<br><br>thanks<br>andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, May 01, 2008</h2>Ok, so it seems I don't need to put anything in the Properties\Resources.resx file.<br><br>I have a Resources folder (just like in WinForms, because Resources.resx would do file links to the file in the Resources folder).&nbsp; The file was already set to BuildAction Resource.&nbsp; In Xaml, I can do this:<br><br>&lt;Image Source="/Resources/Save16.png" /&gt; <br><br>and it just works.&nbsp; Of course now I'm wondering if my resources in WinForms are double embedded; once in the embedded resource file and seperately.&nbsp; <br><br>andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
