<p>What is the expected behavior?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, March 08, 2011</h2><ul>
<li>Create controls creation of a new object (data portal create)</li>
<li>Get controls retrieval of an existing object (data portal fetch)</li>
<li>Edit controls saving of an object (data portal update)</li>
