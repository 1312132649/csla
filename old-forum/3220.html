Look at Chapter 7 of the 1.0 book for details on how to use it properly.</P>
<P>The reason for exposing the property as type string, is that string allows the user to enter an empty value, while DateTime never does. DateTime is a terrible type for data entry <img src="/emoticons/emotion-6.gif" alt="Sad [:(]" /></P>
<P>I'm not sure how to do a dropdown date picker in the grid - it depends on who's grid control you are using and how they handle it. But supporting a picker and a blank entry may be difficult, because so many control vendors follow the DateTime pattern that says the user can't leave the field blank. Lame, but true.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, July 18, 2007</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/basicblue/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>RockfordLhotka:</strong></div><div>But supporting a picker and a blank entry may be difficult, because so many control vendors follow the DateTime pattern that says the user can't leave the field blank.
