<p>A co-worker just came back from an MS event where you gave a chalk talk and FINALLY someone else is anxious here to fully use CSLA.NET.&nbsp; He was very impressed with both you and CSLA.NET.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the MS event ate up his training budget and he probably cannot attend CSLA.NET training in Atlanta.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has the book but he does better with training.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience with Mark Dunn at an Asp.Net Master Class hosted at Carl Franklin&#39;s place in CT.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did it go poorly (Carl stepped in&nbsp;to present the ending of the course because so much material was not covered) &nbsp;but there was no attempt to compensate, fix, redo, etc.&nbsp; I can&#39;t in good faith recommend him to anyone.&nbsp; So before purchasing any videos, I want to make sure its not him that is on it and I am hopeful that it is you as was the case with some of the early videos.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Rich</p>
