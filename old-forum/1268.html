<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my database, I have a table called tblContacts.&nbsp; This is for any human being in the system.&nbsp; I also have a tblAddresses for any addresses in the system.&nbsp; I am at the point where I am coding the BOs to keep track of our company franchisees.&nbsp; So I am wondering if I should make a ContactAddress BO or a FranchiseeAddress BO.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that I said the Contacts are for any humans in the system.&nbsp; Well that means that they will also house a record for each employee in the company or any other system we implement in the database.&nbsp; If I create a ContactAddress BO I can use it as a child object in various other BOs.&nbsp; If on the other hand I create a FranchiseeAddress BO, I will only use it as a child in my Franchisee BO (of course inside a FranchiseeAddresses collection BO).&nbsp; I will then have to make a seperate BO for each type of entity that uses the tblCotnacts and tblAddresses tables.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my thoughts are to lean towards a ContactAddress BO, but I have seen a lot of posts about sticking as close to possible to the real world objects.&nbsp; Do any of you see a downfall of using a ContactAddress over </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 19, 2006</h2>You may want to read this thread, as it covers your question fairly well I think<br><br><a HREF="/forums/thread/6449.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/6449.aspx</a><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeHaynes replied on Tuesday, September 19, 2006</h2><P>WOW that is deep.&nbsp; I still don't think I understood it all.&nbsp; </P>
