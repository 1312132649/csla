I have established a prototype of combing CSLA with ORM. I think it's really meaning to combine ORM with CSLA. CSLA focus on domain modeling while ORM on datamapping. But I wonder why Rocky has no intent to integrate them while they are complementary ? Is Rocky expecting updated ORM or other perfect substitute? Or CSLA itself focus on domain model with no concerning ORM?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Clayton replied on Monday, April 30, 2007</h2>If CSLA is not integrated (bound) with an ORM, then you are free to use whatever ORM you prefer. There are other ORM solutions than NHibernate that people may want to use. Some may not want to use ORM at all.<br><br>Personally, I think NHibernate's performance degradation offsets its usability and maintenance improvements for my applications. So if CSLA were bound to NHibernate, then I wouldn't be interested in using CSLA.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Diz replied on Monday, April 30, 2007</h2>There's also a good discussion of this on p 52 of the C# 2005 book... <br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Thursday, May 03, 2007</h2><DIV class=ForumPostContentText id=ctl00_ctl01_bcr_ctl00___PostRepeater_ctl08_PostViewWrapper>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I can (at last) announce that there is now a ProjectTracker.NHibernate example solution on the CSLAcontrib site on CodePlex.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Can I suggest that all future CSLA / NHibernate questions (especially those related to the ProjectTracker.NHibernate solution) are posted on the CslaContrib forum.</FONT></P>
