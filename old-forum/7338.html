I discovered (by doing as you suggest in my original implementation) that data binding gets very unhappy if you start raising PropertyChanged events on other objects.</P>
<P>By "very unhappy" I mean that focus gets lost/changed on other controls, the UI flickers and the user, by changing one field in a grid, can all of a sudden find themselves on a completely different row in the grid.</P>
<P>PropertyChanged is "owned" by data binding. CSLA raises that event according to what data binding expects - to do anything else tends to render apps useless.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
