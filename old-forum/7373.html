I've had minor connectivity issues with named instances. <br /><br />It's not that it doesn't work, it's just that the computer name alone is sufficent for the default instance. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael replied on Thursday, July 30, 2009</h2><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Thanks for your reply.<br><br>One of my customer's server's already had SQL Server Express installed with just one custom-named instance. So, because there was no SQLExpress instance, does the custom one become the default? Or, do you mean to install the database to SQLExpress regardless?
