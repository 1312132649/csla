<P>Define a class Resource of BusinessBase type, and its collection class Resources derived from BusinessListBase. Mark them as Child in constructors. Now define a class Project derived from BusinessBase. This project class will also be marked as child if u r planning to put it in EditableChildCollection(Projects derived from BusinessListBase) otherwise not marked if to put it in EditableRootCollection(derived from EditableRootListBase). Project class will have Resources as its child. You can find this in ProjectTracker example as well.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TerryH replied on Friday, October 31, 2008</h2><P>Thank you for your response, however what I'm trying to do is have a list of Projects and linked to that list of projects is the list of resource for each project, in a master detail relationship</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
