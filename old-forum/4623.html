<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I'm new with CSLA.NET and I'm frustrated because I haven't found the way to make the inheritance between entities. I've read in other post that the inheritance in CSLA .NET is centred in the behavior, not in the data, but I really need to have different objects. For example, I have some objects like Person, Employee and Client. This objects share common fields and common behaviors, the only difference between this objects are some fields, like an Employee has an StarDateWorking and the client has some other fields. So, I decided to qualify&nbsp;a Person like a base class, and inheritance Employee and client from person. I wish to know, what's the best way to model this objects in CSLA.NET.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I appreciate your help...</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dlambert replied on Monday, April 07, 2008</h2>There's effectively no difference (that I've seen) in handling inheritance when using CSLA vs. not using CSLA.  Since all behaviors of an object are found together, however, really deep and complex inheritance will get complex in a hurry.<br /><br />For example, I've successfully used inheritance to handle a bunch of reference tables that all have a very similar DB structure (mandated by our DBA).  This worked well because of the extremely high coincidence of structure and behavior across objects, and because I needed to construct enough of these  child objects to make the up-front work pay off.<br /><br />In your case, you could probably make inheritance work, but would it be cost-effective in terms of development time?  How about building an interface for these common objects to represent the common aspects of structure?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>juancho559 replied on Monday, April 07, 2008</h2><P>Hi, thanks for your response,</P>
<P>I don't need an interface because the behavior is common between the objects (Person, Employee, Client). The only diference are the fields. I know that in CSLA the idea is to have inheritance centred in the behavior, but I really need to separate this objects. I have a base class (Person) and two objects(Employee, Client) are inheriting from base class.&nbsp;I just want to know how can i make the inheritance with CSLA?, Where Do I have to put&nbsp;both factory and DataPortal_xyz methods?&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
