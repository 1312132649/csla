<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>You mentioned that you're working on a CSLA video series for Windows.&nbsp; Will these videos just cover WPF, or will you also talk WinForms?&nbsp; And will the series have sections covering object stereotypes and data access, or will you fall back to the already-produced (and individually-available)&nbsp;Silverlight ones?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I purchased those two individual videos, because I'm not doing SL work yet.&nbsp; I found those two videos very useful in non-SL CSLA work, though I do realize that the class constructs I saw were SL-specific (i.e. in a Windows world, the code probably wouldn't be&nbsp;organized that way), and some of coding constructs are SL-specific (because of the async-only nature of SL).&nbsp; But, as has been noted, the videos translate out of the SL world very well.&nbsp; Seems like a bit of a gray area there - if you were to do those episodes for Windows-specific work, the content would be largely the same.&nbsp; And if people already bought the individual SL videos, would they get a break on the Windows series, given that it could be seen as paying for the same content twice?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I'm guessing you haven't really delved deeply into this yet, but maybe you have.&nbsp; Any info you can provide would be great.</FONT></P>

It is quite likely that I'll do what I did with the SL series and start selling them before the series is complete with an ever-decreasing discount as I approach completion. Beyond that I don't know that I'll do specific discounts.</P>
<P>It looks like there could be upwards of 9 segments in this series. A set of core segments covering universally applicable topics (object design and construction, data access, security), and segments focused on different interface technologies (WPF, ASP.NET, etc). I may sell the core series as one thing, and sell the interface-specific videos as individuals. I'm sure a business-savvy person would say that's silly, but it should result in less cost to people who just want one interface video.</P>
<P>We're currently scheduled to film some/all of the lecture content on Sept 13, with the intent of the first 1-2 segments being online by the end of September. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
