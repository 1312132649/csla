It doesn't really matter where that code is physically (though having it in a DLL is cleaner imo).</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SouthSpawn replied on Wednesday, July 29, 2009</h2><DIV>I think I have to get rid of compression :( I really think that ICSharp compression component will not work with my hosting provider. I think it depends on something in the GAC.<BR><BR>So&nbsp;I really don't think I need the Compressed Host at all?<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Couldn't I just inherit Csla.Server.Hosts.SilverLight.WcfPortal which will automatically implement the IWcfPortal Interface.<BR><BR>Isn't there a piece of code I could copy out of the CSLA framework to fill in those methods?<BR></DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, July 29, 2009</h2>For any realistic SL app you need some type of compression. If you can't get that library to work, you might need to find another library. There are several commerial options from component vendors, but I don't know if there are other open source (free) ones out there.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SouthSpawn replied on Wednesday, July 29, 2009</h2>Let me look around</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SouthSpawn replied on Wednesday, July 29, 2009</h2><DIV>I found one called ZLib.Net</DIV>
<DIV><BR>I will try that.</DIV></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tetranz replied on Wednesday, July 29, 2009</h2>Just for what it's worth, I've used icsharpcode.sharpziplib in an ASP.NET application on a low cost web host without a problem. Nothing required in the GAC. Admittedly that was a couple of years ago so maybe something has changed. I believe DotNetNuke still uses it.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
