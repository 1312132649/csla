<p>Good day</p>
<p>Learn CSLA, developing an small project.</p>
<p>I have a company and the person objects.</p>
<p>In humans, one company, the company has a few people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I make a rule that allows you to remove the company that are not referenced from the people and does not allow if the links are?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Monday, March 26, 2012</h2><p>There&#39;s 2 kinds of delete:</p>
<p><b>Immediate Deletion</b> (only takes an Id in) and should return an Exception if delete is not possible. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IE, Implement the check in DataPortal_Delete or use Refernetial Integrity in the database.</p>
<p><b>Deferred Deletion</b> (an object is loaded, marked as deleted but actual delete does not happen until Save is called).&nbsp; <br />Here you can create an AuthorizationRule that will accept the object and check if object has &quot;children&quot;). </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
