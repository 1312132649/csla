<p>I have created a silverlight application using CSLA 4. I used the pattern of splitting the partial classes between two projects rather than using compiler directives just because of preference. I now have the task of writing a webform front end that does many of the same tasks as the silverlight project. Is it possible to reuse my classes for the web? I only ask because the static factory methods are async and I&#39;m not sure how that will affect the aspx page. I figure I will have to mark the webpage as async, but not sure if it will just work or if anyone has tried this before.</p>
<p>Any thoughts are welcome!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>This will change with .NET 4.5 and CSLA 4.5 when the new async/await keywords are available. But with today&#39;s event-based callback model it is quite difficult to get ASP.NET to work well with async calls.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Savij replied on Tuesday, May 29, 2012</h2><p>Thanks Rocky!! Thats what I figured, but wanted to be sure.</p>
<p>Great work as always on CSLA, I love working with it!!!!</p>
