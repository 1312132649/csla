<p>There is an issue&nbsp;with the following scenario which is common within our application;</p>
<p>A BusinessBase has a child&nbsp;Images collection. The BB also has a PrimaryImage property which references an Image object within the child images collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to saving and more specifically when ApplyEdit is called after changing the PrimaryImage property an Edit Level Mismatch exception is thrown.</p>
<p>How do we solve this issue?</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>David</p>
