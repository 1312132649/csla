<p>For those that have used CSLA business objects with, say, an ASP.Net MVC application... is there a particular set of JavaScript frameworks/libraries that seem to work really well with CSLA business objects and those that do not work well? </p>
<p>At present, it seems like using Angular with Bootstrap is the flavor du jour that is more or less going to be dictated / but I don&#39;t want to just accept something without good reason.&nbsp; Is Angular with Bootstrap as good as any to take on, or are there better JavaScript frameworks that make working with CSLA objects on the Web easier?</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will&nbsp;continue to hold out hope for something that won&#39;t have me writing JavaScript/HTML :).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Tuesday, December 09, 2014</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>skagen00<br></b></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>That was also my concern some years ago, The quest for an alternative led me to&nbsp;http://www.visualwebgui.com/. Visual WebGUI keeps improving and now it&#39;s free (as in bear).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if you met VisualWebGUI before, but you take a Windows Forms application and you can migrate it to VWG with minimal changes, PROVIDED you don&#39;t use third party controls.</p>
<p>CslaContrib supprts VisualWebGUI by implementing the Csla.Windows control library (as CslaContrib.WebGUI).</p>
<p>For those who used to know VWG, the most annoying non-feature was the asynchronous modal dialog forms. Now all modal dialog forms are synchronous and that makes easier the migration from WinForms to WebGUI.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
