<P>Where is the best place to Publish the event?</P>

<P>I guess I could keep track of what data portal event was called and publish this information in the Overriden Saved method?&nbsp; Any thoughts or a better approach?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Thursday, October 19, 2006</h2>Well, then you'd have to consider an approach similar to the one in ao.<br>Instead of calling observer directly, you need a method in your base class like Publish(). You need to detect whether you're on a remote dp or not and if you are, then store the event info somewhere and then refire the events when the object is deserialized.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
