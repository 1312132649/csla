<p>Thank you&nbsp;for such a great product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS.&nbsp;Hopefully we get the CSLA version for SL4 soon.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, April 30, 2010</h2><p>I am glad you have had a good experience and that your project is going well - thank you for sharing your thoughts!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, April 30, 2010</h2><p>We have a legacy product in PowerBuilder as well - what an interesting concept.</p>
<p>So you have a Web Browser OLE control - are you supplying html with a silverlight object tag somehow (supplying initparms to indicate perhaps the control to show)&nbsp;or are you pointing to an actual page on a site that has the Silverlight application?</p>
<p>How are you passing&nbsp;authentication context from the PB app to the Silverlight app?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ninoarena replied on Friday, April 30, 2010</h2><p>We are for now just pointing to an actual page on the site.&nbsp; Since the Web Browser OLE control does not show the address field or any of the IE header, the users cannot change to other sites or pages.&nbsp; They may not even know they are&nbsp;using Silverlight in the background.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We are right now just passing the database session_id through querystring and resolving the users&nbsp;authorization inside Silvelight.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
