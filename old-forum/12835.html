I have inherited a project that is using CSLA version 1.51.2163.27113. There is a method in the NameValueList component of this assembly named SimpleTableFetch with a signature of&nbsp;CSLA.NameValueList.SimpleTableFetch(String, String, String(), ByRef System.Data.DataTable).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see this method in any of the 1.5 versions of source code on the website. This leads me to guess that the method was added by a previous programmer; but there are no signs of CSLA source code anywhere on my end. I only have DLLs.</p>
<p>Is it possible that this method was part of CSLA at some point; and, if so, where might one find the source code?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, February 26, 2015</h2><p>Only the lasted 1.5 version is available:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx</a></p>
<p>Unless there&#39;s another I don&#39;t see somewhere.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Gary Patterson replied on Thursday, February 26, 2015</h2><p>Yes, I saw those. Downloaded the 1.4, 1.51 and 1.53 versions. None have that method signature. I was hoping to replace the CSLA DLLs with source code but my project is using that missing method and I hesitate to guess at its implementation. This isn&#39;t my actual problem with my inherited project. I was just hoping to get a full trace by using the source code so I could debug my real issue.</p>
<p>I will give this a while in case any old timers have an idea; but I will probably be posting a new topic with my real issue: i.e. really slow performance when issuing MarkOld() on a business object containing collections of business objects that contain collections of business objects. I don&#39;t want to fully explain here. I will save it for another topic.</p>
<p>Thanks, Andy</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Gary Patterson replied on Thursday, February 26, 2015</h2><p>There is a 1.4, 1.51, 1.53 and various alphas and betas out there. None had my missing method.</p>
<p>Thanks, Andy</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, February 26, 2015</h2><p>I don&#39;t recall if that method existed in that version or not, its been a while since I&#39;ve used it.&nbsp; In those days I think it was pretty common for people to modify the source code for Csla though to add helpers as the framework was more of a working sample to go along with the book.&nbsp; Later though it become more of a true framework, and really should be used like any other (don&#39;t modify the source). </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, February 26, 2015</h2><p>You could use a decompiler to get the source code from the dll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 3 free ones to choose from (each have different strengths and weaknesses so I ususally try at least 2 of them)</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>JustDecompile from Telerik,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/decompiler.aspx">http://www.telerik.com/products/decompiler.aspx</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>dotPeek from Jetbrains,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/</a></li>
<li>ILSpy,&nbsp;<a href="http://ilspy.net/">http://ilspy.net/&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>They usually differ on lamda stuff and newer compiler syntax sugar so for v 1.5 I would assume that any one will do the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All 3 support save as C# Project - but Resource files is not correctly generated by all of them. Just try!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my recommendation is</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>use the latest 1.5.x version source code&nbsp;</li>
<li>add missing methods/classes by using a decompiler.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Gary Patterson replied on Friday, February 27, 2015</h2><p>I think that&#39;s a great idea. I had already coded what I thought the method was doing from its usage and from the SimpleFetch method that is already in the source code. Now I can check my guess with the decompiler. Thanks very much.</p>
<p>I wonder ... I need to update some third party controls if I want to use them in designer mode and I was thinking I might update the project from VS2008. Now I am wondering if I should update CSLA also. If I did, should I update to a specific version or just jump all the way to the top and get the most recent version? What do you think?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, February 27, 2015</h2><p>I think moving to the latest CSLA will be well worth it.&nbsp; There are a TON of useful features, better support for plugging into the Csla processes, better support for unit testing, support for more modern UIs (Asp.Net MVC, Metro apps, WebApi), async / await (if you can get to .Net 4+) etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It will NOT be an easy thing to do though, and I think you&#39;ll need to do it in stages as there are numerous breaking changes along the way.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This thread discusses such an upgrade:&nbsp; <a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/10279.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/10279.aspx</a></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
