<p>In the nuget documentation it states:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;<span>Note - Although not dependant on any specific version of Caliburn.Micro, the ViewModel adapter uses code from v.1.5.1.&quot;</span></p>
<p>I understand the library is done by Tiago Freitas Leal. After searching this forum there are no recent posts concerning this.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use CM 2.0 with this library?</p>
<p>If so, does ScreenWithModel&lt;T&gt; replace ViewModel&lt;T&gt; used in the books and MVVM video series?</p>
<p>When would I use ScreenWithModelBase&lt;T&gt;?</p>
<p>When would I use ScreenWithSubject&lt;T&gt;?</p>
<p>After extensive Googling I was unable to find documentation for this. Does it exist?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

<p>CM 2.0 split into two separate assemblies.</p>
<p>A portable class library which keeps the assembly name Caliburn.Micro</p>
<p>A new assembly called Caliburn.Micro.Platform. This assembly now contains many classes (like View) which used to be a part of the Caliburn.Micro assembly.</p>
<p>Tiago or Jonny, how can i contribute a version which is CM 2.0 compatible?</p>

<p>I guess all it takes is to be a project member. Jonny can take care of that part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NuGetting CM 2.0.1 results to a total of 7 compile errors. The simplest one is to delete the</p>
<p><b>#if !SILVERLIGHT</b></p>
<p>compiler directive that surrounds the</p>
<p><b>public virtual void TryClose(bool? dialogResult)</b></p>
<p>method,</p>
<p>There is also an issue concerning View.DefaultContext as this property no longer exists on View. You are welcome to port the code and I can explain how I did it.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
