A browser-based implementation would of course have the objects running elsewhere, but I was wondering the the compact .NET framework implementation for Window CE had the necessary components for CSLA itself. </P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The CE implementation is a user port, and IIRC, most of the CSLA functionality is there.&nbsp; I don't know what version of CSLA was converted, and how&nbsp;"current" they are.&nbsp; I think some fudging had to be done because of some reflection issues, and I think undo was removed for space/speed concerns.&nbsp; But that's going off of memory - check the forum for all the scoop.</FONT></P>

<P>In any case,&nbsp;my impression from&nbsp;a quick investigation is that&nbsp;it's a separate implementation and I'm not sure you could easily implement a set BO's that work both with CSLA and CSLA CE, which was my main question. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, October 29, 2008</h2><P>I wonder if the new CSLA for Silverlight BOs woud run in CE too?</P>
<P>They do not use reflection.</P>
