This isn't a validation thing, it's a check in an Add/Assign etc.<br><br>However, in another post i read this;<br><br><blockquote><span>One of the
basic OOP principles to keep in mind is program to an interface and not an
implementation.<span>&nbsp; </span>A child should not have
a reference to its concrete parent.<span>&nbsp; </span>A
child should know as little about its parent as possible.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is not a good idea for the child to have a
reference to its parent because it becomes tightly-coupled with its parent.<span>&nbsp; </span>This creates a rigid design and does not make
your child reusable.<span>&nbsp; </span>The most common way
to solve your problem is to abstract out what your child needs into an
interface or abstract class.<span>&nbsp; </span>The parent
should implement this interface and the child should only reference the parent
through this interface.<br></span></blockquote><span></span><br>My dilemna - the 'SetParent and [NonSerialized(), NotUndoable()]' way or the 'OOP interface' way. <br><br>Does anyone have a working c# sample of the SetParent way that they could please share?<br><br>thanks in advance<br>FiaB<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SomeGuy replied on Thursday, January 10, 2008</h2><P>You could also have root monitor col1 for changes and throw the exception.</P>
