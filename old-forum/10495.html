<p class="MsoNormal">Given a business object called &ldquo;Rectangle&rdquo; consisting of three
integer properties &ldquo;Width&rdquo;, &ldquo;Height&rdquo; and a read-only &ldquo;Area&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Would you make the read-only
&ldquo;Area&rdquo; property a full blown PropertyInfo property? If so, you would need to create a rule that sets this
property value by multiplying &ldquo;Width&rdquo; * &ldquo;Height&rdquo; and have this rule run every
time the &ldquo;Width&rdquo; or &ldquo;Height&rdquo; property are modified. Is the CSLA official way to do
something like this? I guess that&rsquo;s the way to go if you have to bind the
property to some UI control but it just feels like such overkill to me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Just want to make sure I
am approaching this correctly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>Obviously the more complex the readonly property, the more argument their is to effectively calculate on change and store in a propertyInfo.</p>
<p>In a WinForms app this would work fine with binding, cannot say what affect this would have in other UI technologies. Assume they require a PropertyHasChanged event to be raised to refresh? Anyone?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Saturday, July 09, 2011</h2><p>Surely, you could make a simple property and create a calculate method for calculate Area and raise OnPropertyChanged.</p>
<p>But in general terms I prefer my properties to be as simple as possible (&quot;properties is not code&quot;) and create rules that does the calculation. Rules are generally easier to test and reuse and I prefer to make them as indepent as possible and independet of the actual BO.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
