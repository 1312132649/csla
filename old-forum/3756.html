I know .net 2 is better capable to do this, so I'll be writing some tests soon.</P>
<P>Using CSLA 3.x and .NET 2.0&nbsp;I need to allow an ASP.NET client computer to open and read a serial port and send updates to a data store all within the same domain, no firewalls are transversed. I'm preparing for the actual programming portion of it, but didn't know if another (intermediate) service is required to get the data. (Win/Web service, etc.)&nbsp;Writing to the port is not required.</P>
<P>The&nbsp;requirement is simple from a winform perspective: a form's control to a&nbsp; com port using INotifyPropertyChanged to detect voltage changes (current method)&nbsp;which indicate a count needs to increase. the count quantity is updated locally and sent to the data store for public access.&nbsp;The data stream from the port is consistent, and isn't required to be interpreted... just known to exist/not exist.</P>
<P>AFAIK, a property in a CSLA BO (or any class for that matter) cannot directly bind to a serial&nbsp;port. Only a [form] control can do that. Anyone have any experience doing this? Article to point me to.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance,</P>
