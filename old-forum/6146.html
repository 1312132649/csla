<p>Ok, I finally got the Rolodex example to work.&nbsp; All my Wcf error
messages were due to me NOT having the Web project as the StartUp
project.&nbsp; Glad I finally figured that out through some blogs on this
forum.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Now, I am taking a small of the application I am re-architecting and am
going to rewrite it utilizing Csla 3.6 and Silverlight 2.&nbsp; Need to do some
by hand before CodeComplete comes out with code to generate the complete
application with Silverlight.&nbsp; I always feel like I have to &quot;dig
in&quot; and get my hands dirty and figure stuff out before utilizing a code
generator.&nbsp; Need to know what is going on so when I make changes, I don't
totally mess things up!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I notice there are 3 files under the Rolodex.Business.Server project in the
Security directory.&nbsp; Those files are also shared in the Security directory
under the Rolodex.Business.Client project.&nbsp; The question I have is how did
those files get to the Client project directory Security folder.&nbsp; I have
added existing files and it seems to copy them there, but in the Rolodex
project, they are shared.&nbsp; I like that better because if you&nbsp; modify
one, it gets modified in both places.&nbsp; So, how did you get them to be
shared?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Also, how does the Rolodex project know to fire up the
LoginControl.xaml?&nbsp; I have been looking all over the files to find out how
it knows to fire up that control first, but cannot find it.<o:p></o:p></p>
