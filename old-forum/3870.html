 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I am getting the following error in our development server and our DB is in the Network. &nbsp; </p><p><b>&nbsp; " <font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span>DataPortal.Fetch failed

I'm not sure if this is the only piece of the puzzle that needs fixing, but have you looked into this part of the configuration?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Thursday, November 08, 2007</h2><font face="Arial" size="2">This message suggests that multiple connections are being created within a single dataportal.fetch method, if you do a search on the forums for MSDTC you'll find several posts relating to this problem.<br><br>You need to make sure that only a single connection to the DB is created and opened for any items within that any dataportal_xyz method. Though it was my understanding that this message only appears if you have transaction scope attribute on the method, which the fetch <b>wouldn't normally have.</b><br><br>The reason it works on your machine is probably because it has been enabled at some point and you will not see these errors until you move to another machine. Thus why we have scripts to disable the MSDTC every morning just in case.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>John Kennison<br></font></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
