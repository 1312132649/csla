<P>vbc : error BC30145: Unable to emit assembly: Referenced assembly 'Interop.SQLDMO' does not have a strong name</P>
<P>I am using CSLA 1.x and .NET 1.1 and SQL Server 2000.&nbsp; I might choose to try and achieve my SQL functionality with ADO, ADOX, or ADO.NET, of course.&nbsp; But I have to use another COM Interop assembly in another project anyway (an OCX file with several dependent DLLs - all part of an API offered by the external party's software with which mine interacts).&nbsp; So I'm not sure the re-coding effort would&nbsp;give me a way&nbsp;past this issue in any event.</P>
<P>Is there anything I can do to get around this?&nbsp; Without it, I have some hurdles to jump at my client's site because we have to set up special code access security rules tied to Trust a mapped drive letter where they install my program.&nbsp; I would much rather just have them Trust apps with my signature - if I could just&nbsp;<STRONG>give&nbsp;them&nbsp;one!</STRONG> &lt;g&gt;</P>
