<P>Consider a Silverlight app in 4-tier configuration. You (essentially simultaneously) need to get all your user workstations, all your web servers and all your app servers to discard all their auth rule definitions at the same time, thus causing all the static loaders to re-run.</P>
<P>CSLA could expose a method that would blank all the authz rules - in total or for a type - but there's no global messaging system in .NET or Windows to trigger this to be invoked on all instances of your running app.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
