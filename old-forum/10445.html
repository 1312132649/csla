<p>Thanks,<br />Michel</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 16, 2011</h2><p>You can subclass WcfProxy and override methods to create your own channel factory or proxy object to meet your needs.</p>
<p>This is covered in detail in the <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Portal Configuration</em> ebook.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MichelRenaud replied on Monday, June 20, 2011</h2><p>Thanks - I had not read that far in the ebook yet. That seems to have worked, although WCF (WTF, really) is still timing out. :(</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
