<p>I am trying to make a case for SL for a large, in-house&nbsp;project getting ready to kick off, and feel the above point is important to consider (since when we <em>do</em> have such rich capabilities with CSLA).&nbsp; But a quick search on the matter pointed me to Node.js.&nbsp; Just a brief reading on Wikipedia makes it look like it does run on the server.&nbsp; Could someone tell me whether that really occurs in a manner similar to what we have in CSLA/.NET?&nbsp; Even if it did, I would still assume there isn&#39;t a framework like CSLA that could provide all built-in technical&nbsp;plumbing to make mobile objects happen.&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
