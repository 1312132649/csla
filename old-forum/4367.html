<P>I believe version 3.0 is currently stable.&nbsp; If I use 3.5 Beta 1, will it be easy to supplant the Beta 1 with the release version?</P>
<P>I would hate to start with 3.0 when 3.5 is so close to release.&nbsp; However, I need to get started on the new project.</P>
<P>Any advice?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vdhant replied on Monday, February 18, 2008</h2><P>I dont know about other but i would really try and go for 3.5 if you can.<BR><BR>Imho 3.5 is quite different to 3.0 and brings a lot of new concepts to the table that are not in 3.0. In saying that I dont think WPF, WCF and Workflow have changed all that much in 3.5 (although I think a couple of small changes are in the WPF side in regards to validation).<BR><BR>If I where you I would attempt to start using 3.5 but if you do you have to be prepared for the fact that things will change. <BR><BR>Maybe if you can avoid creating any business objects and just concentrate on your UI, database (and stored procs if you use them), services and Workflows for as long as you can and then finalise your business objects last. <BR><BR>Just a couple of ideas.<BR>Good luck <BR>Anthony<o:p></o:p></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, February 19, 2008</h2><P>We're developing in 3.5 and certain facets such as the managed fields are so fundamental to objects (if you take advantage of them which I suggest you do) that I would recommend going to 3.5. </P>
<P>I would actually suggest that if you go with 3.5 you may end up on a path where you may help uncover a couple glitches, as we did, but that things likely won't be changing in the framework fundamentally to where you're having to go back and re-do something. </P>
<P>Thus far with using 3.5 it has been entirely workable in terms of developing off of. </P>
<P>Good luck,</P>
