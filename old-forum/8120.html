The attribute is invoked like a rule method, and its result is added to the broken rules collection like a rule method. In short, they are just another way to implement rule methods.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, December 09, 2009</h2>
