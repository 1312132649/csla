<P>If you really want me to upgrade all the samples for every release of CSLA I'm left with two choices - remove most of the samples, or dramatically slow down the rate at which I can enhance CSLA.</P>
<P>Remember, it is just me here :)</P>
<P>I fix up samples as I use them. Some I use a lot, others I don't. I realize this does lead to some confusion - but hopefully you understand the issue here. Either I drop the samples or CSLA innovation slows to a crawl.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
