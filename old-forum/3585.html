I just wanted to see if there are other folks in the pool as well.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, September 24, 2007</h2><P>Hi Matt!</P>
<P>Haven't seen you around these parts for a few years. </P>
<P>I am not familiar with those products. I recall a thread that discussed custom atributes in a big way though. It made use of another product to do some interesting stuff.</P>
<P>Maybe a search will turn it up.</P>
<P>Hope things are well with you.</P>
