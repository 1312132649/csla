They also have excerpts from the book published as "Linq Pocket Reference" and "C# Pocket Reference".<br><br>The accompanying LinqPad is an excellent learning tool for Linq and all C#/VB.NET code. Available for free and with includes all samples from the "C# in a Nutshell" book. You can even hook up your own assembly with L2S or L2EF context and write/run Linq queries in C#, VB.NET and more languages.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.linqpad.net">http://www.linqpad.net</a> <br><br>Joesph also wrote LinqBridge - a reimplementation of Linq over IEnumerable for .Net 2.0, also redefines Func/Action delegates and more to allow ndevelopers to use  C# 3.0 syntax and L2O in .Net 2.0 programs. I've used LinqBridge in Csla for N2 to enable most of the features from Csla 3.7.1 and Csla 3.6.3.&nbsp; This should also work for VB.NET in .Net 2.0. <br><br>DotNetKicks also offer a download (pdf book) of Scott Gu's <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/csharp/LINQ_To_Sql_tutorial_Series_By_Scott_Guthrie_Pdf_Book_Format">Linq to Sql tutorial</a> series.<br><br>Other interesting/recommended sites from me is: <br><ul><li>the wiki at <a href="http://www.hookedonlinq.com%20">www.hookedonlinq.com</a> - this site has lots of info about Linq. </li><li>Damien Guards blog at&nbsp; <a href="http://damieng.com">http://damieng.com</a>. He has also published several interesting extensions to Linq. And don't forget to printout his <a href="http://damieng.com/blog/2009/08/12/linq-to-sql-cheat-sheet">Linq2Sql CheatSheet</a> that has one page for C# and one page for VB.BET. <a href="http://damieng.com"><br></a></li></ul></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Saturday, October 10, 2009</h2>Thank you Vinod for your recommendations.  <br />Thank you Johny for your recommendations and for your contributions to the Csla community.<br /><br />By the way shouldn't I be getting something for writing the 37000th post. :-)<br />I mean, what are the odds!!<br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
