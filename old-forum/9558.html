<p>I&#39;m trying to use them in VS2008 VB.NET without any success.&nbsp; The namespace doesn&#39;t even seem to exist here.&nbsp; I&#39;ve double checked my compiled advanced options and my solution is definitely using .NET 3.5.</p>
<p>So why can&#39;t I find this class in the Framework?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, I too thought I was going crazy before I found it!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Tuesday, September 21, 2010</h2><p>Thanks - that did it, of course.</p>
<p>Can I ask another question about them?</p>
<p>My application requirement is just to read some data from the database and report things wrong with it that have to be fixed outside of my system.&nbsp; So I can really live with a&nbsp;ReadOnly object to fetch the data.&nbsp; But can I use Validation Rules functionality with a ReadOnly Object?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don&#39;t care about IsSaveable or any of that... all I need to know is IsValid and to be able to display the BrokenRules.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll need to do an Editable List of some type... but it would be nice to do ReadOnly.. so can it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>Marjon1 replied on Tuesday, September 21, 2010</h2><p>You would need to use an editable object to get the validation rules (and therefore broken rules), which I&#39;ve had to do several times.&nbsp;<br />However ,you can then just make all the properties read-only so you don&#39;t have to worry about users being able to make changes.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Tuesday, September 21, 2010</h2><p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I thought.&nbsp; I really should have just found that in the book instead of asking here but, heck, I was lazy and I was here already &lt;g&gt;.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I&#39;ll try and limit the noise in the future.&nbsp; Hope the rest of your week is a fine one.</p>
