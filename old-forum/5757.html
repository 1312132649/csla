The toolbar has a "New" button and a "Delete" button. I am using CSLA 3.5.</P>
<P>I am trying to find a way to:</P>
<P>1)&nbsp;bind the IsEnabled property of the "New" button to the Csla.Security.AuthorizationRules.CanCreateObject(typeof(Widget)).</P>
<P>2) bind the IsEnabled property of the "Delete" button to the Csla.Security.AuthorizationRules.CanDeleteObject(typeof(Widget)) AND&nbsp;ListView.SelectedItems.Count &gt; 0.</P>
<P>I would prefer to code this in XAML and I am trying to avoid creating an unnecessary instance of Widget.</P>
<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

You can put an instance of ObjectStatus as a resource on your page, bind it to the CslaDataProvider, and then bind your various UI elements to the properties of ObjectStatus.</P>
<P>We might have added them to the CslaDataProvider too, but I don't remember for sure. We did on Silverlight, and I'm not sure if we did the same in WPF.</P>
<P>I don't think the per-type authz properties were exposed in 3.5 (though I could be wrong).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Russ replied on Thursday, November 06, 2008</h2><P>Thanks for the quick response Rocky.&nbsp; I'll get started migrating my project to 3.6b2a.</P>
