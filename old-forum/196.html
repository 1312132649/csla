Neither of these work.&nbsp; Do I have to create a property on the root
object that mirrors the children.Count property so I can bind to this?<br>

When listchanged is fired you could do PropertyHasChanged("ChildCount").<br><br>Just a thought...<br><br>Andr√©s<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>hurcane replied on Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h2>By default, when data binding is bound to an object that implements an interface that makes it look like a list (IList, IEnumerable, etc.), the properties are passed to the current contained object. Data binding does not allow you to bind to a property of the collection when the collection is the data source.<br><br>You can bind this way: control.Bindings.Add("Text", "MyCollection.Count", "")<br><br>This creates more problems than it solves. The primary problem that I have is this introduces a new datasource (an integer). I'm not sure that PropertyChanged() events work with the integer data source.<br><br>The other suggestion sounds like a good workaround. I thought it might be helpful to know why it didn't work.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
