<P>No, I did!</P>
<P>Those two classes aren't ready to release yet, I haven't finished testing them.&nbsp; They shouldn't be there (yet!).&nbsp; So delete them.&nbsp; If I knew how to get them out of source code control, I would.</P>
<P>They'll be re-added when they are ready.</P>
<P>Basically, when Rocky added the rules severity capability (error, warning, info), he forgot (or didn't have time or didn't want) to add it to the read only classes.&nbsp; Techically, a read-only class could have broken rules (severity = warning or info), but the ReadOnlyBase class has no support for determining which rules are broken.&nbsp; The ReadOnlyRuledBase&lt;T&gt; class is adding that capability, but it's not quite working yet.&nbsp; Once it does, RuleReadOnlyRuledBase&lt;T&gt; would add the public properties of BrokenRules and Rules, just like RuleBusinessBase&lt;T&gt; has.</P>
