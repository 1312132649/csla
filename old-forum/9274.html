I glanced through the change logs and will probably sit down and read them all to find out if it got moved or completely removed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-small;">Anybody have any info on this?<br /><br />Thanks</span></p>

<p>If this is Windows Forms, then that is a component from CSLAcontrib on codeplex and was never part of the core framework.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
