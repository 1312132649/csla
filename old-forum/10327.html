<p>I am currently working on a Silverlight project using CSLA 3.8. We would like to make a &lt;Border&gt; XAML element change according to the severity of a property&#39;s broken rules, much like how &lt;csla:PropertyStatus&gt; produces a different icon depending upon the severity of the broken rule. For example, a red border would indicate a save is not possible, whereas a yellow border would indicate Warning-level rules have been broken, but the record is still savable.</p>
<p>From the posts I have read, it appears the best way to produce this effect is by way of the PropertyInfo control, which is only available in CSLA 4.1 and above. Can this effect be produced without PropertyInfo, using CSLA 3.8?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, April 29, 2011</h2><p>The simplest solution might be to back-port PropertyInfo to 3.8.</p>
<p>Alternately you could restyle PropertyStatus to have no visual appearance (I&#39;ve never tried - but I suspect it should be possible).</p>
<p>Either way, you need a PropertyInfo-like control against which your UI elements can bind.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
