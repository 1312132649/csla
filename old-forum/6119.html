And in any case they are used for data insert/update/delete, but not retrieval. You should read Chapter 18 for the details around this - but some of it is simply to illustrate various techniques you can use. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>luky_13 replied on Saturday, January 10, 2009</h2>Thanks Rocky, great help.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
