(There is no other functionality and property than the assignment itself!) Whereas the permissionlist itself should be edited, the single permissions (content of the list) shouldnt. Thereby I thought, that I should use BusinessListBase for the list itself and ReadOnlyBase for the contained objects. This doesnt work.<br /><br />Do I have to use BusinessBase for the list's-content?<br /><br />Kind regards and thanks for any hint.<br /><br />Volker</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 11, 2009</h2><P>Yes, you'll have to use BusinessBase as a subclass for something to be contained in a BusinessListBase.</P>
<P>Of course, there's no rule that a BusinessBase subclass must contain any properties which are writable (i.e., have property setters), so this will work fine for your needs and BusinessBase will provide you with Child_DeleteSelf and Child_Insert, which I&nbsp;imagine you'd used to add or remove the row from the table linking roles and permissions.</P>
<P>HTH</P>
