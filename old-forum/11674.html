I decided to finally post.</p>
<p>The primary links bar on the page (Home Page, Blog, CSLA Home, etc.) doesn&#39;t render or function the same in Chrome as IE. All items display differently and those that are supposed to have drop-downs don&#39;t function. For example in IE the drop-down from &quot;Downloads&quot; gives you &quot;Download CSLA .NET&quot; and &quot;Other Downloads&quot;. In Chrome nothing actually drops-down and clicking on the arrow or link takes you to the same destination as &quot;Other Downloads&quot; in IE. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to get to the &quot;Download CSLA .NET&quot; URI in Chrome.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 06, 2012</h2><p>Thanks for the post. I&#39;m aware of the issue, but haven&#39;t had time to restyle the site to fix it.</p>
<p>I created the original style using a web-based style generation tool, but that was before Chrome existed. Sadly Chrome works differently from FF/IE and so the style doesn&#39;t work. It goes to show how HTML is super-expensive, because things that work perfectly can break just because some browser vendor gets a wild hair and redefines some behavior...</p>
<p>Fixing it isn&#39;t trivial, because it means either understanding the now-ancient HTML/css generated by that tool (which is beyond my skills), or entirely restyling the web site by finding a new style generation tool and reworking the sites.</p>
<p>I really do plan on doing that restyling at some point, but it hasn&#39;t been as important as maintaining CSLA itself, so it just hasn&#39;t floated to the top of my priority list yet.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Dane replied on Tuesday, November 06, 2012</h2><p>I figured it might be something like that but just wanted to be sure the issue was know.</p>
