<p>When I databind a normal businesslist to a windform datagrid, I don&#39;t get any sorting functionality out of the grid.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is as expected.</p>
<p>I can simply do:</p>
<p>x.DataSource = new Csla.SortedBindingList(of Y)(Y.FetchList()) </p>
<p>and that will cause all the sorting functionality to work correctly.</p>
<p>However, in Rocky&#39;s book, he says that SortedBindingList and FilteredBindingList are obsolete with the introduction of LINQ.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Am I correct in thinking that using the sortedbindinglist would still be the ideal way to get sorting in a winform grid?&nbsp; I don&#39;t see any simple way to get the same results using linq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, February 17, 2010</h2><p>Well, they are and they aren&#39;t.&nbsp; They&#39;re obsolete really because of Wpf and SL, and WinForms is now being considered legacy technology.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But if you&#39;re still on WinForms, you should continue to use those classes if needed, because WinForms doesn&#39;t understand Linq.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cmay replied on Wednesday, February 17, 2010</h2><p>Thanks for verifying that for me.&nbsp; I wasn&#39;t sure.</p>
<p>Any idea why the Sorting and Filtering were not built into BusinessListBase back before Linq was an option? </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, February 17, 2010</h2><p>I think its because&nbsp;there&#39;s overhead associated with it, and if you don&#39;t need it you&#39;d still pay the price.&nbsp;Sorting and filtering is often though just a UI concern, and so shouldn&#39;t be part of the business layer. Csla provided those as a convience.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Saturday, February 20, 2010</h2><p>Hi, </p>
<p>Sorting/Filtering is usually closely connected to functionality in the UI and as such should not be in the core BusinessListBase. </p>
<p>DataSets implement the IBindingListView interface (that supports sorting/filtering) but unfortunately - there is no generic implementation from Microsoft available. There is one open source implementation on SourceForge tho&#39;. </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
