<p>Also, is there any reason to strong name Csla?&nbsp; If there is can we have a -Unsigned package as well?&nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 21, 2014</h2><p>You may be able to use an assembly redirect in your app.config file to resolve the version differences.</p>
<p>The Bcl.Async packages in nuget have been a problem since day 1, because they do some things that don&#39;t fit well into the tooling model (or so I&#39;m told). I&#39;m not sure how to resolve those issues to be honest, at least short of releasing a new CSLA build every time any of the various nuget packages we rely on change.</p>
<p>CSLA is strong named because that&#39;s a requirement for quite a number of .NET shops. For better or worse a lot of shops require signed assemblies. Normally being signed is not a drawback for people who don&#39;t care, so the lowest friction option is to always sign.</p>
<p>Why would you want an unsigned version?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
