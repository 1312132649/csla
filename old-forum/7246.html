My web apps are actually running in IIS on my windows 7 box, which I'm begining to think may be the issue...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ChrisM replied on Thursday, July 09, 2009</h2>I just grabbed the Demo006 code from Rocky's vid series and it has the same issue. It seems like the silverlight.js I have is not loading the Sys namespace?  That make any sense to anyone, and how do I fix it?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ChrisM replied on Thursday, July 09, 2009</h2>Okay, finally figured it out.  When the SL project is set up as the start up, then the Ajax js libs won't load.  Once I switched to the web project, it worked.  For my code, at some point the .html page had been set as start up, once I switched that back to the aspx, it started working fine.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, July 09, 2009</h2><P>And how is that different from what Sergey said? &lt;g&gt;</P>
<P>Sounds identical to me.</P>

The demo in my code was caused by having an IIS site server up a .html file instead of the ASPX.  Evidently the .html file in my web site wasn't loading the Ajax Js libs.  Once I changed it to use the .aspx file as the start up it fixed it.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
