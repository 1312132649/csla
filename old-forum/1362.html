If anybody can help, it would be much appreciated! Here's what I did:</P>
<P>State: EditableRoot<BR>-Products: EditableRootList of Product: EditableChild</P>
<P>Product also contains:</P>
<P>private State _state;</P>
<P>which introduces potential cyclical references.</P>
<P>The problem is that UndoableBase:CopyState() crashes with a stack overflow when I bind Products to a DataGridView. When I remove _state, everything works fine, but I need each of my BOs to have a reference to the top most BO so they can traverse the tree and access other objects as necessary. How can I fix my problem?</P>
<P>TIA,<BR>K</P>
<P>PS. I'm using CSLA 2.1 RC1, it looks really nice! I'm looking forward to using the filtered lists in a few days, just what I needed!</P>
