than the derived List object; however, one would imagine that the
ObjectAdaptor is sending you a definite no no. <br>
<br>
On the subject of DataAdapter bugs:&nbsp; I am having exceptions with
Nullable(of DateTime) properties. Can't provide much detail at this
time - as I have not yet had time to persue the issue.<br>

I don't know if that's your issue, but perhaps it is a clue?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jimbo replied on Saturday, April 21, 2007</h2>Basically, DataAdapter needs to be able to convert Nullable(of T) to DBNull.Value when creating the datatable rows.<br>
When I pass a datagridview data source list its not a problem as the
Null date (and or minValue) is preprocessed and expressed as an empty
string; but passing the root BO (csla) list is when the exception will
occur. <br>
Again, until I have analysed the issue in more detail there is little more to contribute at this time.<br>
