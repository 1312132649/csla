<P>Sorry for the noobish nature of this but I just can't get the PTWeb app to work on a new machine.</P>
<P>It all works perfectly on my home box, from when I first installed it all last year but, on this other machine I'm having problems.</P>
<P>Everything is configured the same as the home machine as far as I can tell.&nbsp; Everything builds fine and PTWin works flawlessly but when I try to run PTWeb I can't login.&nbsp; I get the login screen up (incidentally I had to change the default files on the PTWeb virtual directory settings in IIS to login.aspx as otherwise I got nothing) but when I enter the username and password and click to login, I get an exception in the Fetch method of the DataPortal class.&nbsp; The "result = proxy.Fetch(..." line throws the exception "Object reference not set to an instance of an object".</P>
<P>It looks like the EnterpriseServices proxy is throwing the exception but I just can't see why.&nbsp; Everything looks fine to me.</P>
<P>Anyone got any ideas of things to look for as I'm at a total loss here :(</P>
<P>Toby.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 20, 2007</h2>If you had to manually set the default document to login.aspx in your virtual root, then it sounds like ASP.NET isn't properly installed/configured on your machine. It should have added default.aspx to your global list of default documents if it was configured correctly...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vertigo1 replied on Thursday, June 21, 2007</h2><P>Hi Rocky,</P>

You most likely won't need it anyway and it adds a huge level of complexity to the task of getting PTwin to run.</P>

<p>Hi Rocky,<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>It's possible that something else was set incorrectly when I couldn't get it
to work with the original&nbsp;default documents in the virtual directory
settings.&nbsp; Just tried changing it back to default.aspx and it works fine
now.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The default page comes up, I can click the login link and enter the username
and password fine, so it looks like the ASP.NET pages are being generated and
served fine, it's just when I try to actually login I get the above exception
on the DataPortal Fetch method.&nbsp; Looks like the EnterpriseServicesHost is
failing to retrieve the data from the database somehow, although everything
seems to be configured correctly from what I can tell.<o:p></o:p></p>
