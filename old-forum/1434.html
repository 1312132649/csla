Can remoting handle this in real time ?<br>q2.)&nbsp; I would also need to have server in full control, meaning has to keep track of all client and send selective data in to each client (push from the server.)<br>q3.)Also Server must be able to kill, restrick and enhance client with specific messages with out shuting down the client.<br><br>possibel ? anybody did this ? please post your expert advise. <br><br>Any like to sample code?<br><br>TIA<br>Sendi<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, October 10, 2006</h2>Certainly this is outside the scope of anything CSLA handles. CSLA uses Remoting (or any other network protocol) to allow the client to contact the server.<br><br>But looking at the issue from a broader perspective, the general answer is "yes", but you'll have to do a lot of work and live with some serious restrictions.<br><br>Remoting, like web services, is a connectionless protocol. No TCP socket connection is maintained between client and server. The exception to this is that you can buy 3rd party Remoting channels that DO maintain a bi-directional TCP socket connection.<br><br>If you are just starting your project, I'd suggest you look at WCF (.NET 3.0), because it includes a bi-directional channel.<br><br>Why is this important? Because your typical client doesn't have a routable IP address. It is relatively uncommon to be in a situation where the server can "ping" the client. And if the server can't extablish a TCP socket to the client, then the server can't initiate communication. The typical solution is to have the client establish <i>and maintain </i>a connection: which means using a bi-directional TCP socket.<br><br>So yes, Remoting can do this with a 3rd party channel. WCF does it with a channel provided by Microsoft.<br><br>Either way, you will need to write your own protocols and code to handle your q2 and q3.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sendi_t34 replied on Tuesday, October 10, 2006</h2><br>Thanks Rocky for your reply,<br><br>Do you know if wcf is freeware technology or like MSMQ ?<br><br>Sorry about those spellings<br><br>Thanks<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
