<p>I am very happy to announce the release of CSLA 4, with support for .NET 4, 
Silverlight 4 and Visual Studio 2010.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a major release of the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/">CSLA 
.NET</a> framework, not only because of the support for the Visual Studio 2010 
wave of technologies from Microsoft, but also because of significant changes to 
CSLA itself based on feedback and input from the vibrant <a>CSLA community</a>.</p>
<p>As always, CSLA .NET couldn&rsquo;t exist as it does without the strong support I 
receive from <a href="http://www.magenic.com/">Magenic</a>. Thank you!</p>
<p>CSLA 4 is the result of a lot of effort on the part of a global development 
team:</p>

and <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4AuthorizationRules.aspx">here</a>)</li>
<li>Base list/collection types are now ObservableCollection for WPF; 
(BindingList implementations still exist for Windows Forms and some third party 
WPF controls)</li>
<li>Support for MVVM in Silverlight and WPF</li>
<li>Support for new Silverlight 4 data binding and validation features</li>
<li>Support for ASP.NET MVC 2</li>
<li>Allow an object to be bound to multiple bindingsource controls in Windows 
Forms</li>
<li>Silverlight data portal is now as extensible as the .NET data portal</li>
<li>Rework LINQ to CSLA to be easier to use</li>

in nunit with some work)</li>
<li>New solution and project structure to isolate UI technology support from the 
core framework</li>
<li>Consolidated release for .NET and Silverlight</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this is a major version change (from 3 to 4), there are numerous 
breaking changes, which are highlighted in the change log.</p>
<p>In terms of future activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am actively working on ebook and video content covering CSLA 4. Right now 
you can get special pre-release pricing on the CSLA 4 MVVM video series at <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/">http://store.lhotka.net</a>. Watch for more ebook 
and video content on the store over the next few months.</li>
<li>I am also actively working on CSLA 4 for Windows Phone 7, and I&rsquo;ll have more 
information about this over the next few months.</li>
<li>As always, <a title="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Roadmap.aspx" href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Roadmap.aspx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Roadmap.aspx</a>&nbsp;contains 
my plans for CSLA related work and content.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy CSLA 4 and find it useful in your development efforts. I 
know the CSLA 4 development team has put a lot of work into this release, and 
we&rsquo;re all excited to see how people make use of it to create cool 
applications.</p>
<p>Code well, have fun!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Also we worked hard on getting the <a href="http://www.codesmithtools.com/generate-csla-code-with-templates.aspx">CSLA CodeSmith templates</a> in sync with CSLA4 and Silverlight 4. Which worked out nicely as it allowed us to QA CSLA4, quite a bit (maybe push an extra RC in hehe)!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>CSLA has ben a wounderful o work around with and thanks for such a great framework. I have a project(developed by vendor) which is already using CSLA 3.8.2, now i(who dont have depth knowledge of CSLA) have to upgrade it into CSLA 4.3.12. The main issue here is time constraint. I have to complete this task in 6 weeks, and this solution file consists of 17 projects. So is there any link where in there is a direct comparision of these two versions of CSLA framework? Your early response would be appriciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-10.gif" alt="Embarrassed" /></p>

<p>The release notes is best place to start. See link in Rockys post. Note the Breaking Changes.</p>
<p>#1: The new Rule system will require rewrite of rules and updated skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2: Create your own base classes (if ot already present). List classes is default ObservableCollection. For WindowsForms make sure that your base classes use XYZBindingList classes.</p>
<p>#3: PropertyChangedMode in 4.x is Xaml. Make sure to set to Windows if your client is WIndowsForms.</p>
<p>#4: Indexed LINQ (IQueryable) is removed from list classes. &nbsp;Use Linq2Object and ToSyncList instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#5: CommandBase is now Cloneable and the DataPortal will make a clone before sending/calling DataPortal_XYZ.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>chethantr replied on Friday, July 13, 2012</h2><p>
<p><span>Hi JonnyBee,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks
a lot, you have been very helpful for me. I was able to convert most of the
methods to higher version from the links provided by you.</span></p>
<p><span>If
you can remember, there was a class called&nbsp;RuleArgs under Csla.Validation
in 3.8.2 version. But I could not find equivalent Class in 4.3.12 version?</span></p>
</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, July 13, 2012</h2><p>That&acute;s correct.</p>
<p>The entire ValidationRules namespace (including RuleArgs) &nbsp;belongs to the old RuleEngine and is not part of the new RuleEngine.</p>
<p>It is possible to enable <i>MOST </i>of the old validation rules (at least for the migration period) but this is not included with CSLA. this possible by adding a few classes from the old rule engine and use rule extensions to add old style rules as LambdaRules in the new rule engine. </p>
<p>All Authorization rules and async business rules from the old rule engine must be rewritten to classes.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>chethantr replied on Friday, July 13, 2012</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, July 13, 2012</h2><p>Rewrite the code in EventIsNotOverDelayLimit (static method) to a class that inherits from Csla.Rule.CommonRules.CommonBusinessRule. Ratherr the relying on RuleArgs you us the RuleContext parameter to the Execute metod in the rule. Remeber - 1 instance of the rule is used for ALL instances of a given class - and you should regard each rule instance as a singelton class (ie: NEVER store instance related properties in a rule instance).</p>
<p>The USING CSLA 4 - Creating Business Objects ebook is a good documentation of the new rule engine. You can also look at the Samples/Net/cs/RuleTutorial sample.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>chethantr replied on Wednesday, July 18, 2012</h2><p>HI,</p>
<p>I was able to re-strucutre the into class based on your input. Now its that, if you can remember that there was a class called &quot;<span>DecoratedRuleArgs&quot; in&nbsp;</span>Csla.Validation which was inheriting Csla.Validation.RuleArgs. Now in 4.X version, what would be the equivalent class, any input on this?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>chethantr replied on Wednesday, July 18, 2012</h2><p>to be more specific, here is my piece of code for 3.X version</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Serializable]</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public class SyntaxRuleArgs&lt;T&gt; : DecoratedRuleArgs</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public T Syntax</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {&nbsp;get { return (T)this[SyntaxName]; }&nbsp;}</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
<p>Also in some post i read that BusinessRule have some properties as an alternative for &quot;public object this[string key] { get; set; }&quot;, but couldn&#39;t find it.&nbsp;</p>
</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, July 18, 2012</h2><p>Read Rockys post, sectio InputProperties and InputPropertyValues:</p>
<p>http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4BusinessRulesSubsystem.aspx</p>
<p>BusinessRule also offers the ReadProperty/LoadProperty methods for access to properties in context.Target (similar to ObjectFactory).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>chethantr replied on Wednesday, July 18, 2012</h2><p>and how about the&nbsp;BrokenRulesCollection.CreateCollection() method in Csla.Rules.BrokenRulesCollection class? is&nbsp;CreateCollection ruled out?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, July 19, 2012</h2><p>BrokenRulesCollection has a public contructor now. </p>
<p>Please create new threads rather than postaing on this CSLA 4 Release annoncement thread. <br />These questions is not connected to the&nbsp;relese announcement of CSLA 4 - rather a theread on how to migrate rules from 3.x to 4.x. </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
