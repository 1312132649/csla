<P>Our state agency does alot of outsourcing/cosourcing on various IT projects.&nbsp; We don't want to necessarily lock ourselves into having only two companies as an sourcing option on .net projects,&nbsp;should CSLA become our standard.&nbsp; This same principle applies to hiring mentors/trainers to come in and provide us guidance and training&nbsp;in the&nbsp;use of CSLA.</P>
<P>Even better, it would be nice to have the names of companies located in Oregon or SW Washington.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thanks much.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 15, 2008</h2><P>I know there are other people and/or companies who do consulting on CSLA. Whether they are in your area I don't know...</P>
<P>In terms of training, the only company I've licensed to do training is Dunn. Over time I've talked to a couple other companies, but it is a serious investment up front to build a class, and it is questionable whether they'd get the investment back if they have to compete with someone who's already got a successful class up and running.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RanceDowner1234 replied on Wednesday, July 16, 2008</h2><P>Thx for the info.&nbsp; I'm hoping it won't be a show stopping issue.&nbsp; At the end of the day, we will just&nbsp;expect consultants to learn&nbsp;CSLA if they do not have prior experience with it.</P>
<P>BTW I used CSLA&nbsp;on a project&nbsp;a couple of years ago and loved it.&nbsp; I think there are alot of pros to adopting it on an agency level.&nbsp; The primary being that using a framework, in general, encourages us to code in a unified way.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The biggest obstacle we&nbsp;currently face&nbsp;is that inhouse programmer A, B, C are all great coders, but have greatly varying styles &amp; methodologies.&nbsp; Then we outsource a couple of projects, and consultant A, B, C are all great coders too, but also have greatly varying styles from eachother, and from our inhouse staff.&nbsp; It&nbsp;naturally breeds&nbsp;maintenance/cross-training issues.</P>
<P>I think using a framework will help get our inhouse and consultant resources on the same page.&nbsp; And CSLA is definitely in the running.&nbsp; Thanks for your hard work on it, it's great stuff.&nbsp; And thanks again for the information.&nbsp;</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RikGarner replied on Thursday, July 17, 2008</h2>IMHO one of the most important, albeit invisible,&nbsp;advantages that&nbsp;CSLA brings&nbsp;is that it forces all your developers to code <EM>in the same way</EM> (which you could call a 'pattern' I suppose <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /> ). This is an immense benefit especially in a consultancy, like where I work, where developers move in and out of teams pretty frequently.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
