<p>New to CSLA. Lots to absorb. &nbsp;From looking at previous info I need some things clarifying &nbsp;and would ask your assistance.</p>
<p>1) Versions</p>
<p>Can I use 3.8.3 in VS2010 targeting .Net 3.5 (I know CSLA 4.0 targets .Net 4)</p>
<p>I am very excited (but have no experience) by Silverlight.</p>
<p>2a) It makes sense to use SL4 &nbsp;and therefore this must use CSLA 4.0 and vs2010?? &nbsp;Any reasons not to start with this version?</p>
<p>2b) If 2a is correct I can&#39;t seem to find any sample code/projects showing CSLA 4 using Silverlight 4- is this correct (or have I overlooked something?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2c) I believe &nbsp;there is info on Silverlight &nbsp;and CSLA 3.8.3 by way of the Silverlight videos - is this &nbsp;SL3??</p>
<p>So I can&#39;t workout the best route to SL and CSLA from what looked at on the web site - any advise (in way of a learning map) &nbsp;warmly welcome.</p>
<p>Finally...</p>
<p>3) Not knowing much about SL I am looking to rewrite a business app. Currently vb.net/windows app/sql 2005 which has a online module (for bookings) - due to clients not able to give access to the office server my app has two databases - client office and ISP database (with a hotch-potch of data sync stuff)......this is obviously not the best way.</p>
<p>So a new version really needs to have all data stored online, so office can access and online user can do their bits. &nbsp;I could write a new vb app (or wpf) and a new web app (as now I guess) &nbsp;to target the single data source or as SL seems to offer a windows type user experience then I would only need one SL application.</p>
<p>Is my analysis correct here - do you think that this makes sense. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional info.</p>
<p>The app is basically a job booking system - 5-10 office users -&nbsp;similar&nbsp;on-line&nbsp;clients (although this may grow but only to a 100. &nbsp;Abount 3 or 4 main client will use to book upto 50 jobs a day -so this is light usage system).</p>
<p>I know there is a lot of queries here but any advice would be good &nbsp;as being a lone developer I just need some reassurance of my understanding.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>That said, CSLA 4 beta 3 is nearly out, and my plan is still for CSLA 4 to release by the end of June, so I think it is valid to consider using CSLA 4 for a new project that targets SL4.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>peterj replied on Sunday, June 13, 2010</h2><p>Hi</p>
