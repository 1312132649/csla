Currently it is hard coded to get the proxy from <FONT color=#008000 size=2>CslaDataPortalProxy</FONT>&nbsp;in the appsettings of the&nbsp;app.config file. I need the flexibility to set the config source to be an external xml file or the parameters passed to the application. It is not that hard to do it but would like to know if somebody has already done it. It would be nice to have this baked in the framework where the default is to use the app.config settings.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, August 27, 2008</h2><P>.NET already does this. CSLA uses the System.Configuration system in .NET, and they already allow you to reconfigure how System.Configuration gets the settings - including from other config files, or custom providers that you might create.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
