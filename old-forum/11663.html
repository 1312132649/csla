<p>The old code works all right but Caliburn.Micro has improved its code to solve a number of&nbsp;issues. So I&#39;ve re-done the&nbsp;port of Csla&#39;&nbsp;s ViewModelBase and all Caliburn.Micro methods.</p>
<p>This is based on Caliburn.Micro 1.3.1+ (3cc9a20b8554 2012-10-12) and Csla 4.3.13.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a pre-release since CslaContrib will be updated to use this code.</p>
<p>You can grab the assemblies and the code at <a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B0hxPXhUZfjITzRhZHhSM1lHWTA/edit">my shared google drive</a></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>c_manboy replied on Tuesday, November 06, 2012</h2><p>Tiago,</p>
<p>I had a need for a ConductorWithModel class and ended up copy/paste the conductor classes from CM and substituting Screen with your ScreenWithModel.&nbsp; I also changed your Screen&lt;T&gt; to Screen&lt;M&gt; so that there were no conflict.</p>
<p>I dont know if this is something you would want to add, but I have found it helpful.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mgaray replied on Thursday, November 08, 2012</h2><div><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:x-small;"><span class="187485823-08112012">Hi

contribution. I&#39;m new to Caliburn.Micro and CSLA. Do you have any CSLA sample

get me started?&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have a CSLA + CM sample&nbsp;that can be published.</p>
<p>For those that are familair with Caliburn.Micro and Csla, a sample isn&#39;t really needed. A sample would be usefull for those that know CSLA and are starting on Caliburn.Micro.</p>
<p>For those that aren&#39;t familiar with neither of these frameworks, a sample is almost useless. Each of these frameworks has its own&nbsp;set of rules/principles that must be well understood before doing anything that works. If that&#39;s your case, I&nbsp;suggest reading the &quot;Using CSLA 4&quot; ebooks and all Caliburn.Micro documentation you can find. Of course samples of each framework <em>per se</em> are also useful.</p>
<p>Concerning samples, my priorities go to CSLA + MVVM Light Toolkit as a way to test my ViewModel adapter for this MVVM framework. A CSLA + CM sample may result as a side effect. That is not a promise though <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mgaray replied on Friday, November 09, 2012</h2><p>Thanks for the quick response Tiago!</p>
<p>A CSLA + CM sample is exactly what I&#39;m looking for. Looking forward to a possible one.&nbsp;:)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bill.mybiz replied on Monday, November 19, 2012</h2><p>Yo People!</p>
<p>I just wanted to throw in that I also would love a CSLA + CM sample, but it&#39;s not core essential. CSLA is awesome, and so is CM <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-15.gif" alt="Geeked" />.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
