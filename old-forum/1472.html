<br>
Just wondering what's a good way to go about tweaking the CodeSmith
templates?&nbsp; We are new to CodeSmith and would like to tweak the
output code to work for us.&nbsp; Nothing major, but would like to
add/delete a few things here and there.&nbsp; Obviously we can go in
and alter the main templates but as soon as the next verion of the
templates are released, then we would have to go and re-add our
changes.&nbsp; What would be the best approach?&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>When a new set of templates are released I simply have to reapply the documented changed from my change log.&nbsp; I know its not an automated solution, but it works!</FONT></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
