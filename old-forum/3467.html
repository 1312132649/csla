<P>But ClientContext may not be ideal because that flows across from client to server on <EM>every</EM> data portal call. That'd be more expensive than doing a dictionary lookup <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
<P>It sounds like you only need the app name for the login process, not on every data portal call. So it seems to me that getting the value from config and passing it in your identity object's criteria would be most efficient.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
