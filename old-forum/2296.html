<P>Anyone interested drop me a private message and I'll get your information to pass along.</P>

<P>P.S. Rocky, maybe you could add a new forum specifically for this type of posting? A way for CSLA developers to network and help each other and keep these posts from cluttering the main forum. Just a thought...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, February 08, 2007</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/basicblue/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>SonOfPirate:</strong></div><div>P.S.

But it is important to keep in mind that some people only interact with the forum via email, and they only see the main discussion forum, not any other forums.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
