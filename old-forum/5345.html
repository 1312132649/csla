E.g. have a proxy which is capable of utilizing e.g. 26 (52) connections by round-robin on a.www.website.com to z.www.website.com instead of just www.website.com?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 05, 2008</h2><P>It is actually due to a bug in the WCF stack on Silverlight, where multiple simultaneous connections to the same server may (and does) result in random 404 errors on some of the requests.</P>
<P>Sometimes they work, sometimes they fail, you can't predict. Nor can you do anything about them...</P>
<P>So we put a (hopefully temporary) workaround into the data portal so it only allows one request at a time. This solves the issue, but obviously isn't ideal.</P>
<P>On the upside, in most business apps you aren't doing a lot of simultaneous requests anyway. Get a customer, save a customer, get an order, save an order.</P>
<P>Early in an app's lifetime there are probably a lot of NVL objects and maybe some read-only lists, being loaded and cached - so this hurts that process. But for most of an app's lifetime only one request is occurring at a time anyway.</P>
<P>Not that I want to keep this workaround!!!! I'm just saying it isn't the end of the world.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
