The book is very clear and well written and&nbsp;the end result is Business objects that are OO. </P>
<P>I would agree with Mr. Lhotka that OO is the way to do things, especially over a data centric approach. This remains to be the problem with SOA. Sure, you can share data... but you're still blind as to what the business rules are, data isn't enough alone.</P>
<P>I still&nbsp;have some remaining concerns and I would appreciate any help with addressing them:</P>
<P>1) It seems likely microsoft will address this problem area directly in time. If it is built directly into .net it is more likely&nbsp;to have&nbsp;better support.</P>
<P>2) How long will this framework be supported? What happens if Mr. Lhotka gets eaten by a pack of wolves on a camping trip tomorrow?</P>
<P>3) Has anyone tried&nbsp; a OO database like <A href="http://www.intersystems.com/index.html">http://www.intersystems.com/index.html</A>? Does this help solve the problem? Where are the alternatives to Mr. Lhotkas framework? I see a lot of ORM but really nothing that create OO business objects... why is this?</P>

<P>Well it just seems like the ONE thing that microsoft has going for it is the development tools and I think this makes their product very appealing to business owners. Thus, business objects is much more appealing than datasets any day of the week.</P>

<P>This is true. The community could certainly attempt to maintain this code when bug reports come in.</P>

<P>This is very confusing for me because I see these arguments and they make a lot of sense in Rocky's favor. However, I am wondering why, if Rocky is very correct, why the industry doesn't recognize this and why microsoft itself doesn't build business objects directly into the pie. I agree so much with Rocky in that data has very little meaning when you take it out of its business context. And that is why I agree that SOA is mainly marketing noise and perhaps business rules need its own language. Having a business rules engine or something baked directly into your development tools would be awesome. <BR></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>vdhant replied on Wednesday, November 19, 2008</h2>On the OODbms argument, its important to remeber that it may solve some problems but causes a whole heap more...<br><br>Critics of navigational database-based technologies like ODBMS suggest that pointer-based techniques are optimized for very specific "search routes" or viewpoints. However, for general-purpose queries on the same information, pointer-based techniques will tend to be slower and more difficult to formulate than relational. Thus, navigation appears to simplify specific known uses at the expense of general, unforeseen, and varied future uses. However, with suitable language support, direct object references may be maintained in addition to normalised, indexed aggregations, allowing both kinds of access; furthermore, a persistent language may index aggregations on whatever its content elements return from a call to some arbitrary object access method, rather than only on attribute value, which allows a query to 'drill down' into complex data structures.<br><br>Other things that work against ODBMS seem to be the lack of interoperability with a great number of tools/features that are taken for granted in the SQL world, including but not limited to industry standard connectivity, reporting tools, OLAP tools, and backup and recovery standards. Additionally, object databases lack a formal mathematical foundation, unlike the relational model, and this in turn leads to weaknesses in their query support. However, this objection is offset by the fact that some ODBMSs fully support SQL in addition to navigational access.<br><br>In fact there is an intrinsic tension between the notion of encapsulation, which hides data and makes it available only through a published set of interface methods, and the assumption underlying much database technology, which is that data should be accessible to queries based on data content rather than predefined access paths. Database-centric thinking tends to view the world through a declarative and attribute-driven viewpoint, while OOP tends to view the world through a behavioral viewpoint, maintaining entity-identity independently of changing attributes. This is one of the many impedance mismatch issues surrounding OOP and databases.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Wednesday, November 19, 2008</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Well... if you look at MS's history, it's fairly obvious (at least to me) that MS does not share the BO view.&nbsp; MS has had a data-centric view ever since ADO first came about, and they built their entire IDE infrastructure around that.&nbsp; They are starting to move away from that with EF, but it's still largely a data-centric view&nbsp; - after all, the "E" stands for Entity object, which is vastly different from a Business object.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>(I would also disagree with you that business owners view objects as "better" than datasets any day of the week.&nbsp; Most developers do not see that - otherwise MS and VS would have evolved differently -&nbsp;and most business owners - at least those I've worked with - wouldn't care one way or the other.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Having said that, switching from a data-centric viewpoint to an object-centric viewpoint is not nearly as easy as it sounds.&nbsp; MS was at least eventually smart enough to build their IDE's around interfaces, thus giving you the ability to do it and get a pretty decent design-time experience (also one of MS's decisions, and also another bone of contention among developers.)&nbsp; But you see how much work it takes to get that, and it still doesn't interface as well as the native .NET objects do.&nbsp; Providing a "better" interface to manage an object-centric system would incur even more overhead to Visual Studio, since they couldn't really abandon the current viewpoint.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I guess I have had a difficult time with datasets. Mainly with embedding business rules in them and I have been working with them for the last 2 years fairly exclusively. Datasets are great for building a UI in two seconds and getting data into and out of the ui quickly. But they fail horribly when you start adding business logic to the app in my opinion.</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tmg4340 replied on Wednesday, November 19, 2008</h2><P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>In my experience, "business owners" are non-technical folks who don't really pay too much attention to how we solve their problems - only that we do solve them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them tend to think I work just over the "black magic" line, so to speak.&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />&nbsp; Perhaps your definition of a business owner&nbsp;is different than mine, or perhaps yours have a different mindset than mine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>As for working with DataSets - well, if DataSets (and its predecessors)&nbsp;were all that and a bag of chips, Rocky probably wouldn't have had near the incentive to start the CSLA project in the first place.&nbsp; <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></FONT></P>

<P>I'm not sure if this is becauses of lack of understanding, or they just don't know there is a better way, or are comfortable with what they do know and happy to build systems like they've done for ever.</P>

<P>I think this comes down to the simple difference between data-centric and behavior-centric design.</P>
<P>If your application is designed purely around data, with behavior as a secondary consideration (and an often informal one at that), you can often create something quickly, but it is difficult to maintain or modify over time.</P>
<P>If your application is designed purely around behavior, with no formal thought given to data, I suspect the same poor results would occur. I think this is hypothetical, because our industry is so data-focused that I've never seen this happen.</P>
<P>My hope with CSLA is to get people to at least consider behavior at an equal level with data. Yes, data is the "most valuable asset of an organization". But data without behavior is meaningless. Useless. </P>
<P>So I don't argue that data should be analyzed and normalized and carefully organized into databases. But I do argue that behavior should also be analyzed and carefully organized into some first-class structure. </P>
<P>In my case, I think that first-class structure should be a set of responsibility-based, behavioral business domain objects. And this is what CSLA .NET tries to support - the easy creation of these first-class behavioral objects. These objects <EM>use</EM> data, but aren't designed around data. Just like the database is useless without behavior, but isn't designed around behavior.</P>
<P>I have no problem with people who want to create business layers using function libraries, workflows, rules engines or other techniques. That's all good too, because there's a formal "home for behavior" in those models. (though honestly, I do think those techniques are inferior to a good OO design)</P>
<P>Things like a DataTable or EF entity onto which you graft some behavior are ultimately doomed (imo), because they are data constructs first, and any behavior is an after-thought. Behavior is still second class, and in the end that'll lead to disaster.</P>
<P>Conversely, if you have the discipline (and can overcome the tooling limitations) you could create EF entities that are responsibility-driven, and coincidentally have data (as required by the behavior). I suspect this will be easier in EF version 2 or 3, but today it is sadly not practical for anyone but the most dedicated and masochistic.</P>
<P>Which is why I think CSLA .NET is a good answer. If you do the OO design "right" (by which I mean you use the single-responsibility pattern, and make your objects exist to fill roles in your use cases), the end results can be really great.</P>
<P>Is this more up-front work? Probably. Does it save time/money/effort over the lifetime of the app? I absolutely believe it does.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>kyle.l.watson@gmail.com replied on Thursday, November 20, 2008</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div>But data without behavior is meaningless.

<P>This is where I agree the most. I believe you said somewhere that this was a limitation of Soa - as the behavior/context of the data is unknown.</P>

<P>Deklarit at least seemed to give the appearance that one was trying to build out _from_ the business object. I don't recollect that well from years ago, so I don't quite remember.

<P>The one thing we wanted to avoid was being on our own little island dependent on some 3rd party dll we couldn't control or change.
