This grid can render 'combobox-ish' cells, but they are not 'true' comboboxes (i.e. System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox instance), but merely have an appearance that resembles comboboxes. <br><br>Usually, 3rd party grid controls <i>do </i>provide a mechanism to at least do something that resembles databinding. In Infragistics' Grid for example this is manifested in so-called ValueLists. They do not provide true databinding capabilities, but it's reasonably workable.<br><br>So, to answer your question:<br>- I don't know your particular control, but it sounds like databinding is not supported at the cell level, however you'd better make sure;<br>- perhaps your control supports databinding differently, or in a workable fashion like Infragistics does<br>- otherwise: you will have to take the DYI approach ...(do-it-yourself), which is not too hard actually<br><br><br>Bayu</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
