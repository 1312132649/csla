What I'm having trouble understanding is how to get a reference directly to the (child) root object from the UI (Webform gridview) to do insert/update/delete, and would appreciate some guidance as to just how this is done.</P>
<P>The only choice I see to have are supplying a collection index, which I don't have, or the child object, which I also don't have - at least I can't see it.</P>
<P>Thx</P>
