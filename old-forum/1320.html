<P>User Controls are already having their Dock Property to Fill but still there is Code in Panel Resize which assigns Panel's ClientSize to Control's Size..</P>
<P>Why this is required ?? I commented out this code in my project and still resizing is working.. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Thursday, September 28, 2006</h2><P>any comments on above points...</P>

<P>as i feel that just setting usercontrol dock property to Fill automatically takes care to autosizing of control and resize code in panel's resize is not required..</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>figuerres replied on Thursday, September 28, 2006</h2><P>You may be right.</P>
<P>the sample was mostly to show how CSLA works, not as the best UI / winforms app ever made.<BR>in a post a while back when I mentiond a problem I had in first using the "winpart" UC Rocky </P>
<P>commented that it was "Just a sample".&nbsp; </P>
<P>so the time is spent on the CSLA library and classes - PT is just a quick demo app.<BR>use it if you like or roll your own UI is I think the idea.&nbsp; I have used a bit of it in my app but not much.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
