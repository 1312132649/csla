I'm on my 2nd try and am almost through with the Code portion, the second half being XAML.  I'm curious to hear others' opinions, as I'm finding it to be both fascinating and unbelievably frustrating.  You get info available nowhere else, but he seems obsessively fascinated with the logic and mathematics of rendering graphics (every chapter, page after page of it), to the degree that the purpose of the chapter gets lost.  <br /><br />I read the Amazon reviews, and it seems to be the consumate love it/hate it relationship.<br /><br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
