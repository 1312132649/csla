A Small question.

I try to make my first ASP.NET CSLA form today and I am bit confused.

In the properties for the csladatasource object there is a property
called "TypeAssemblyName". 

I assume that I should point it to the assembly where my CSLA classes
are stored.

But , if I make a web-project where I have no separate assembly
for my CSLA classes, then this won't work? As I won't know the assembly
name for my ASP.NET web-project? (Basically, I include the CSLA classes
in my web-project directly).


Does this mean that I am forced to use a separate project for my CSLA classes?
to be able to use the csladatasource functionality?

(I know its good to have a separate assembly for them, but my question is if 
it is possible to not having it?)

<P>You should also create a set of Base classes in your BO project that Inherit from Csla. The derive all your BOs from your Base class instead of directly from Csla.</P>
<P>You should do this even if the Base classes are all essentially blank. In the future you will decide you need to extend Csla somehow and then you will be very grateful that you have these Base classes in place.</P>
