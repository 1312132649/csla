Anything CSLA related coming down the pipe for the Win Phone 7? I admit the development for the native platform looks fantastic but I am not sure if the adoption rate is going to be there to make it worth my time. Right now I can write a HTML5/CSS3 web app and have it work on the major touch phones. Somehow I don&#39;t think WinPhone 7&#39;s IE 7.5 is going to be as easy.</p>

<p>My summary of the whole thing: if you had any doubt that Silverlight was worth learning, that doubt should be pretty much disintigrated at this point <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
