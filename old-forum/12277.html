<p>I am trying to upgrade an existing application build on Windows Form -CSLA to MVC 3- CSLA. </p>
<p>The windows form application consists of many forms which have a master detail functionality. In other words the user can edit a CSLA root&nbsp; object properties (presented from textboxes, comboboxes ecc) and also a child collection presented from a grid in which he can edit, add or remove rows. Than a save operation through root.save stores all the data&nbsp; (root object and dependent child collection) just in one step.</p>
<p>Does anyone has any real word example implementation or a suggestion how this functionality can be implemented in MVC 3 - CSLA? </p>
