<p>I really hope I can find an answer to this Dilemma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just move to a new version of telerik reporting. In the previous version Telerik reporting and Csla worked beautifully.&nbsp;Now, Telerik added&nbsp;Data Source Components. The limitation this thing has is that I does not take static methods either in design mode or runtime. as a result of this I cannot see the fields to draw new reports and even less run it. The guys from Telerik told me that I can go around this by wrapping the static method. I&#39;ve tried delegates without success(maybe I&#39;m doing something wrong).&nbsp;</p>
<p>my question is how can I wrap a CSLA static method?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The answer to your question is yes. But since the factory method is a static one Telerik suggested that I should wrap the static method</p>
<p>Temember that this is in design time (using telerik wizard)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
