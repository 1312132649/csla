<P>And if you just want to use a Root object (that doesn't support IList), you can just create an arraylist, add your object to it, and then use that arraylist for the report's datasource.&nbsp; Very nice.&nbsp; No need to fool with the data adapter at all.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
