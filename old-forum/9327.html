<p>Now that I am in Csla4.0, my UI isshowing a lot of red, the TextBox controls have red borders, there is sliding red - and I mean red, message that pops out when the TextBox is entered, and of course the PropertyStatus is still there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the SimpleApp, which also has DataAnnotations on the Name Property, and a PropertyStatus in UI is showing only the PropertyStatus.</p>
<p>I would like to standardize my UI on a single behavior.&nbsp; Is there a way to turn one or the other on/off.&nbsp; Is there some guidance as to which is more in fashion these days?&nbsp; Of course the PropertyStatus is of value in many other ways for enabling and disabling controls.&nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, August 06, 2010</h2><p>This is because you are using Silverlight 4, not because you are using CSLA 4.</p>
<p>SL4 has some really nice validation stuff built into the UI. If you are not using warning/info severity rules, you might choose to just use the built-in stuff (I frequently do). In which case you&#39;d just not use PropertyStatus controls.</p>
<p>Or if you want PropertyStatus, then you need to add a clause to each binding expression to turn off the SL4 feature to handle NotifyDataErrorInfo.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Friday, August 06, 2010</h2><p>For us the decision is relatively simple., we&#39;ll use PropertyStatus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our users are in our Apps all day, every working day, year after year for decades.&nbsp; For them, SL&#39;s system is way overbearing.&nbsp; For example, sticking out&nbsp;a red message saying&nbsp;that data in a field is necessary when the user clicks in/tabs into a textbox is not very polite and will get old very quickly.&nbsp; I can hear our users screaming, &quot;Why do you think I tabbed into this field - you moron&nbsp;- you don&#39;t have to tell me this is necessary every single time!&quot;&nbsp; SL system is great for survey forms, etc. where user will fill out a form once.</p>
<p>More importantly, Csla community has been clamouring for warning/info serverity rule system for years.&nbsp; I am looking forward to putting this capability to some good use.&nbsp; Also, I am not sure SL&#39;s system work (may be it will - I just don&#39;t know) in situations where you have more complex rules involving multiple properties and their interaction with each other.</p>

The primary thing you lose is the severity concept, and the PropertyStatus look and feel.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>griff replied on Friday, August 06, 2010</h2><p>Hi</p>
<p>I too am interested in this. &nbsp;It&#39;s acceptable if your form has a few controls but if it&#39;s already busy with 30 or more controls then this &#39;feature&#39; with red&nbsp;highlights&nbsp;do make too much noise. &nbsp;Unfortunately I&#39;m putting all my resources into getting up and running with Sivlerlight at the&nbsp;moment&nbsp;and can&#39;t put any time&nbsp;to&nbsp;solve this one....I would be very interested (I&#39;m sure others will be as well) if you find a good workable solution. Keep up posted please.</p>
