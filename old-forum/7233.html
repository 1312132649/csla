<P><BR>I believe that IsSelfValid means that the current object is Valid and IsValid checks both itself and any children.</P>
<P>If that is correct then how can IsSelfValid = True and IsValid = False when there are no children and the BrokenRulesList is empty?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I've regenerated my objects and have been beating my head against it off and on for a day or two.</P>
<P>Any insight would be awsome.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>colemn203 replied on Monday, July 06, 2009</h2>Never mind I was able to figure it out.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DocJames replied on Monday, July 06, 2009</h2><br />And the answer is?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, July 06, 2009</h2><P>You can't just pull a "Roseanne Rosannadanna" and leave us hanging like that! &lt;g&gt;</P>

For some reason we were not calling mybase.IsValid and where just calling IsValid.</P>
<P>I knew it was something dumb from the start but I overlooked it. The plus side is that I have a good understanding of the whole validation process works.</P>
