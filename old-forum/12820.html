<p>I have read on many posts about the error message that it is there because we try to write to a collection when it is in ReadOnly mode.</p>
<p>In my case I am setting a property and after that using PropertyHasChanged(string item) method</p>
<p>where the error comes.</p>
<p>The class in which we have used the validation is inheritted from BusinessBAse.</p>
<p>I would like to know where is the best place to set ReadOnlyP propert to False and&nbsp;</p>
<p>which method shoul I implement and if you can let me know how.</p>
<p>I would appreciate,</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
