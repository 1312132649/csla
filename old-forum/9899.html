<p>Make sure that the <strong>Application project</strong> is selected in the Solution Explorer&nbsp;before you click F5.&nbsp; What the VS is doing is &quot;running&quot; whatever file/form is selected in the Solution Explorer - which is the standard behavior.</p>

<p>But , I&#39;ll try to describe my problem i think.</p>
<p>Yes I have select correct app project. SO the situation is like this :</p>
<p>I tried to create small WPF app, in VS 2010, I choose .NET Framework 4. </p>
<p>I tried to display a window with a video file only ( CSLA MVVM Intro :) ). </p>
<p>When I was run ( F5 ) =&gt; The Displayed window is BLANK Window ( BLACK Screen window ) and the video of CSLA MVVM Intro is doing the right behavior ( I can hear the roc voice ).</p>
<p>And then I tried to run from debug folder manually =&gt; I got the correct result ( Video and Audio is run both )</p>
<p>I tried another alternative to changed my application into 3.5 Framework on properties, i run again use F5 =&gt; I got the correct result.</p>
<p>SO.. I don;t know why if i use .NET Framework 4.0 i can&#39;t run my app use F5 ??</p>
<p>I&#39;m waiting for this :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot everyone </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God Bless You</p>
