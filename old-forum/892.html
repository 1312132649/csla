The application has been up and running for a year or more and the said pc has been capable of running it all that time. </P>
<P>Now all of a sudden when attempting&nbsp;to launch the app from the particular pc it fails with a FileNotFound exception.</P>
<P>NetRun was unable to launch the application <A href="http://iSop/TimesheetManager.exe">http://iSop/TimesheetManager.exe</A>.&nbsp;File or assembly name TimesheetManager.exe, or one of its dependancies was not found.</P>
<P>Anybody any ideas ?</P>
