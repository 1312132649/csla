Sometimes, items in the list cannot be deleted, for whatever reason.  So I'm trying to work out a good way for the UI to determine this.<br /><br />In this case, an instance that is saved into the database can't be removed, but if a user addes a new row they should be able to delete it.<br /><br />So whats would be the "proper" way to handle this?  Add a CanDelete property to the instance?  Add a CanDelete method to the list? (The list already overrides RemoveItem to prevent removing instances).<br /><br />Should there be some standard way to ask if an item can be deleted?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Friday, August 14, 2009</h2>Hi,<br><br>I will point to my answer to another similar question:<br><a HREF="/forums/permalink/35485/35490/ShowThread.aspx#35490">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/permalink/35485/35490/ShowThread.aspx#35490</a><br><br>I prefer to use the methods that Rocky has already provided in Csla and add my own custom checks in overrides. <br><br>/jonnybee<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
