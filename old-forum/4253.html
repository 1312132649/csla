For example:</P>
<P>c:\projects\csla20cs\...</P>
<P>c:\projects\ProjectTracker20cs\...</P>
<P>And then you must build the Csla project first before attempting to build ProjectTracker.</P>
<P>Visual Studio uses relative paths to find the reference though, so having the projects in the same relative position is required - unless you want to run through each project in the ProjectTracker solution and remove/add a reference to Csla.dll.</P>
<P>Oh, and the references are for the debug build (bin\debug), so make sure you are building the Csla project in Debug, not Release.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dbsaxman replied on Tuesday, January 29, 2008</h2><font size="2"><font face="Verdana">Thank you, that seemed to fix that problem... encountering other issues, but not ready to ask further questions until I do a little more homework.&nbsp; Thanks again.<br></font></font></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
