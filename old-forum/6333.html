<DIV>I know this error doesn't say much here.</DIV>

<P>Sounds much more like an ASP.Net Session issue.</P>
<P>There are 3 models for this:</P>
<P>1. In process - fastest but riskiest as you lose all session data when the AppDomain recycles - which happens more often than you might think.</P>
<P>2. Session State Server - Out of process - in memory of some server (even itself) - slower as you have to serialize the session blob in and out - but safer as you do not lose anything when the AppDomain recycles.</P>
<P>3. Database - Out of process - about the same speed as #2. Even safer as you do not lose anything even if the web server goes down.</P>
<P>Your problem may exist due to #1.</P>

<P>Remember to set this attribute back to "RemoteOnly" when releasing your application into production as you don't want users to see the details.</P>

No amount of config file changes can help you then... :(</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
