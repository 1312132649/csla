<P>Error:Principal must be of type BusinessPrincipal, not System.Security.Principal.GenericPrincipal </P>
<P>I got this resolved by creating my own custom csla principal and then forcing a logout on Page_Load.&nbsp; Problem is that I was hoping to use Windows Authentication!&nbsp; In my work environment, we have our own User Authentication system setup that we perform inside the rest of the application.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It seems silly to me to have to create a Principal object from BusinessPrincipal that serves no purpose for every application in our environment...&nbsp; Is there not any other way to not to have to do this????</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, July 23, 2008</h2>Setting CslaAuthentiation = Windows in your .config file should be all that's necessary. I never had to create a custom principal... but that value must be set both in your app.config and your remoting host's web.config.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, July 23, 2008</h2><P>Andy is correct - as long as you *really* plan on using Windows authentication. Many people say they plan to but they really have a hybrid in mind. If you need to get roles or Permissions from some source other than Windows then you are planning on a hybrid - and that will require a custom Principal. There are many threads on this topic so you can do some research if your plans change.</P>
