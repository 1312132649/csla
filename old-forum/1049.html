<P>1.&nbsp; I need the ability to mark a record as inactive so that I can still use it for reporting, but I don't delete it.</P>
<P>2.&nbsp; I have to interface this with DotNetNuke modules somehow.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In response to item one, I plan on:</P>
<P>1.&nbsp; Adding a 'Active' bit field in all my Sql tables.<BR>2.&nbsp; Adding DataPortal_Activate and DataPortal_Deactivate methods for BusinessBase and BusinessListBase.<BR>3.&nbsp; Add CanDeactivate() and CanReactivate() methods for checking user rights.<BR>4.&nbsp; Instead of Fetch, I plan on using FetchActive and FetchAll to retrieve records for the object and make SQL Server stored procedures for those as well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I haven't researched how to interface DotNetNuke with CSLA yet.&nbsp; If anyone has done this, I would appreciate some help.</P>

<P>I use this for my "deletion" logic so that when a user deletes an item it gets marked as Active=false and then is not shown.</P>
<P>I am working thru my first project with CSLA so I am not all the way thru the life cycle but I see no problems with this or other tweaks.</P>
<P>as for the DNN stuff there is in CSLA an "ObjectAdapter" thing that I recall as reading that it can output datasets and other custom objects .... so you may want to look that up as one way to go.</P>
<P>also CSLA can go with WebServcies and DNN uses WebServices, will CSLA and DNN be on one server or different servers ?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DeHaynes replied on Tuesday, August 29, 2006</h2><P>Sorry I haven't gotten online to respond lately.&nbsp; I was sidelined by another project.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To answer your question, DNN and CSLA are on seperate servers.&nbsp; I am actually thinking of installing the CSLA application server on the SQL Server where the actual data is stored.&nbsp; I know you probably think that is a mistake, but my company has a max of 75 employees and we are keeping records for 1700 entities.&nbsp;&nbsp; (700 stores and 1000 owners)&nbsp; And most of the the financial data exists in a seperate Great Plains SQL server.&nbsp; I am building the system from scratch because my company doesn't currently have a centralized data repository.&nbsp; The overall goal is to build a company Intranet and Extranet.</P>
<P>About the Active/InActive ability, did you provide an interface/functionality to reactivate an object?&nbsp; My thoughts where that if I programmed the Active status into the framework, then I would subsequently enable the UI the ability to work with Active and InActive objects.</P>
<P>Another&nbsp;reason I was thinking about putting the code in the framework is because essentially EVERY table and record in the database will have the ability to be Active or Inactive.&nbsp; By putting this in the framework, I reduce my code.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It has the by-product of getting me very familiar with the CSLA framework.&nbsp; My hope is that I can take the knowledge and make a Report-Business Object framework.&nbsp; I have a couple of specialized applications that I have created for my company that do intense calculations.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;hope to automate the number crunching of the reports into Data Objects and expose it via the same process that CSLA exposes it's data, along with using a security model. </P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
