However, inheriting (which is different from usinggenerics) from a non generic, if I'm right, shouldn't give you the statics - they belong to the ancestor class. The thing with generics is that they're really not a class themselves, just a template for other classes. </P>
<P>If you do FxCop, though, it frowns on using statics within generics - I'm not entirely sure why, I haven't read an associated article. </P>
