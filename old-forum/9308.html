<p>In my project I&nbsp;have been using SL Navigation to navigate through more than two dozen pages in one region of a larger overall SL page. The navigation is triggered through button clicks outside the navigation Frame.&nbsp; Everything has been working like a charm.&nbsp; </p>
<p>SlDemo appears to be demonstrating the same exact process&nbsp;using a different technique by setting the MainContent of&nbsp;a ContentControl&nbsp;in response to button clicks outside the mainContent area.&nbsp; Seeing that I have come quite far with the SL navigation, I would probaby not want to backtrack on this issue.</p>
<p>One thing that I would love to implement and which SlDemo has, is showing the IsBusy control and the StatusText - and I would like to show it outside the &quot;MainContent&quot; area, in my case outsite&nbsp;the Frame area and in a single set of controls for the entire app, &nbsp;just like SlDemo.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t yet figured out how to do that and would appreciate a hint or two.</p>
<p>The secong thing I would love to do:&nbsp;&nbsp; All of my View -&nbsp;Model communication is through a number of &nbsp;ViewModels, but only a single ViewModel is handling the entire ObjectGraph.&nbsp; I did learn in the video and&nbsp;saw in&nbsp;SlDemo the Overload of a ViewModel constructor where the Model object is being sent as a&nbsp;parameter (hint, hint)&nbsp;- interesting.&nbsp; I am waiting for the last video before embarking on that just so I don&#39;t barge into something undesireable.</p>
