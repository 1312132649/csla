<P>Can't find a reason why PTPrincipal and PTIdentity classes was put into the Business assembly. Is there a reason for this?</P>
<P>I have a application that's about to evolve into covering a second business area. Each business area will have their own business assembly for re-use. Can I separate custom security into it's own assembly&nbsp;to be used&nbsp;by both business assemblies or for re-use by other applications?&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
<P>Regards</P>
