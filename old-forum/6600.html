It came back with an exception about trying to convert the lambda(Type, Int32, bool) to lambda(Type, bool). I then just did a ToList on the BusinessListBase object then applied the Where extension with no problem. Is that overloaded method just not supported directly by the BusinessListBase?<br><br>Thank you,<br>Kelly<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DivisibleByZero replied on Thursday, March 12, 2009</h2>If BusinessListBase implements IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; then it would work. Maybe you had your lambda wrong?<br><br>class ChildList : BusinessListBase&lt;ChildList, Child&gt;<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public IEnumerable&lt;Child&gt; Select(string foo)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return this.Where( c =&gt; c.Foo == foo );<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>}<br>class Child : BusinessBase&lt;Child&gt;<br>{ <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; public string Foo { get; set }<br>}<br><br><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Killian35 replied on Thursday, March 12, 2009</h2>Thank you for your reply! However, I've failed to explain my problem correctly. I'm using the Where overload that accepts an index variable, like so:<br><br>var list = MyList.GetList();<br>var filtered = list.Where((emp, index) =&gt; index &gt; 50); // does not work<br><br>This will use the current item's index within the list for the 'index' value. However, this does not work on a BusinessListBase class. This causes an Exception. Somewhere down in the code there
is an attempt to cast the lambda(Type, Int32, bool) to lambda(Type,
bool). It does work on a regular List&lt;&gt;, so the following works correctly:<br><br>var filtered = list.ToList().Where((emp, index) =&gt; index &gt; 50); // works<br><br>So if I push the business list to a generic list, the Where LINQ works as expected, giving me access to the current item's index.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kelly<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, March 13, 2009</h2><P>It is possible this is caused by LINQ to CSLA. Or by Collection&lt;T&gt; or BindingList&lt;T&gt;.</P>
<P>I'll add an item to the bug tracker so this gets looked at in more depth when Aaron has time.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Friday, March 13, 2009</h2><P>Cna you try 2 alternatives on your BLB class?</P>
<P>1. For MS Dynamic query extensions use a string for filtering:<BR>var filtered = list.Where("index &gt; 50"); </P>
<P>2.Also use&nbsp;std LINQ syntax:</P>
<P>From x in list Where x.Index &gt; 50</P>
<P>Do either (or both) of these work? They probably should.</P>
