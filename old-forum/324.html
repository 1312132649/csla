This occurs in the IDE designer and results in DetailsView and Gridview controls not displaying properly. The app builds and runs OK - just a designer issue.</P>
<P>Have confirmed the new Typeloader class is present. The problem can be corrected by restarting VS, but it comes back as soon as any changes are made to the page.</P>
<P>Anyone else seen this, or know how to correct it?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dfmartin replied on Thursday, August 03, 2006</h2>Did you ever find a solution to this?&nbsp; I'm experiencing it now that I updated to 2.0.3.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, August 03, 2006</h2><P>Peter, the CslaDataSource in 2.0, 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 is problematic - you should upgrade to 2.0.3 where it is much better.</P>
<P>Overall though, the issue you guys are seeing is (I think) due to the way VS caches web project files. Somewhere in one of the VS cache directories you have an old version of Csla.dll and that's causing your problem - at least that's my hypothesis...</P>
<P>You might try running Build | Clean Solution to force VS to clear a lot of that stuff. Otherwise you may have to manually track down the cache directories and clear them.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
