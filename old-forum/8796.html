<p>I would say, there is no reason why it should not work, but I suspect there will be a few minor changes, such as removing dependency on System.WIndows.Browser, which is not supported on the phone, to get it to work.&nbsp; I am convinced that there will be a version of CSLA that works on WP7 though, as there are not technological barriers that would be obvious to making this work.</p>

<p>In terms of priorities though, the first priority is to get CSLA 4 released, then work on the phone version <img src="http://forums.lhotka.net/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /></p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
