<P>I have the following hierarchy in my application</P>
<P>Programs</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sites</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site</P>
<P>I have programs/projects as the top level of business object.&nbsp; The problem is that people have different roles across the different projects and different sites.&nbsp; There is a different site_admin at each site which is also different in each program.</P>
<P>So when program_id = 400 john has role=program_admin but in program_id = 200 he does not.</P>
<P>Within program_id = 400 and site_id = 47 he is the site_admin but not at program_id=400 and site_id in (41..46)</P>
<P>Obviously in the database it is quite easy as I have my application roles and I have my data_roles that are tied to the entity.&nbsp; I'm trying to figure out how best to do it in the CSLA authorization.</P>
<P>I don't want to re-read the roles based on a program_id/site_id all the time as you can jump all over the place and that would get confusing.&nbsp; I've contemplated appending the data_id to the role name and doing something like ProgramAdmin400, SiteAdmin400 and then trying to do the same in my authorization.&nbsp; It gets a little bit annoying though...</P>
<P>Surely someone else is doing something similar?&nbsp; Any suggestions.</P>
<P>thanks</P>
