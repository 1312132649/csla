Actually, i have one business class that represents Products, and i have one class that inherits BusinessListBase, witch contains all the Products, so I could later bind  that list to the combobox and other fields in GUI... Now, my problem is that i can't find a way to itterate products, so i can add them to the ProductList, because ther's Id that's used to get a single product from database and i can't get all of Id's from the DataSet just like that !!!<br />I know my way of describing this is a bit confusing, but i don't know what to do!!!<br /><br />It would be great if someone had some advice!!<br /> Thanks<br />Luka</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mamboer replied on Monday, April 13, 2009</h2>Hi,<br>I suggest that you take a look at the ProjectTracker project,it's very helpful with your begin with Csla.net.<br><br>http://www.lhotka.net/cslacvs/viewvc.cgi/samples/trunk/CslaNet/cs/ProjectTrackercs/ProjectTracker.Library/<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lmatovic replied on Monday, April 13, 2009</h2>Thanks for the suggest, but I already tryied it and still, it's a bit different, it uses LINQ to SQL, and i use Entlib data acces application block, and there's used some differrent way of loading values into the form</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
