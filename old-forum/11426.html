<p>I have BB that could have children of the same type, I have property to determine if the current instance is Simple or Complex</p>
<p>and I have Price property</p>
<p>Let me give you this example:</p>
<p>Water (Simple), Sugar (Simple), Milk(Simple), Pie(Complex), Tea(Complex)</p>
<p>Pie contains: Water + Sugar + Milk<br />Tea contains: Water + Sugar</p>
<p>Breakfast contains: Pie + Tea + Water</p>
<p>so if I open Pie window and edit the Price of sugar, ChildChanged will fired and I will update price of the Pie,</p>
<p>but Breakfast cost will not get updated until I open its window and manually call refresh method which will do all the calculation.</p>
<p>my question is this, can I automate this process as I had a lot of objects and I can&#39;t figure what is the best practice to fix this problem.</p>
<p>I am thinking of updating this using linq but I am hoping to find a better more robust solution</p>

<p>The safest way is to do this within triggers in the database. </p>
<p>If you wish to do this outside the database then I would create CommandObject(s) to do the recalculation and call this from the Update method of the actual BusinessObjects. Remember this will have to be done recursively.</p>
