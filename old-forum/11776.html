<p>We have a number of classes that provide business logic and act as glue between our MVC controllers and business objects. Can these be vanilla classes or should they inherit from one of the CSLA classes? Or perhaps there&#39;s a design issue and these methods should be part of a relevant business object?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Thursday, January 10, 2013</h2><p>Sounds like you are writing some ViewModels (i.e. that&#39;s the glue).<br />I think there is a CslaViewModelBase class that helps here with binding - worth investigating.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Stijn replied on Thursday, January 10, 2013</h2><p>The classes contain no properties, only methods that manipulate data based on parameters and/or make calls to a third party webservice.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Thursday, January 10, 2013</h2><p>Can you show an example?</p>
<p>&quot;We have a number of classes that provide business logic....&quot; sounds like they might be candidates for being in your business layer model.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you wanted them to be CSLA inherited classes, what would they be?&nbsp; Command objects maybe?&nbsp; What are they actually doing in your user story?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Stijn replied on Friday, January 11, 2013</h2><p>They&#39;re indeed more our less our business layer.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t specifically want them to be CSLA inherited classes, it&#39;s just being done this way right now and I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s necessary.</p>
<p>Our flow is something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>User visits a page on the website</li>
<li>MVC Controller talks to the business logic, sending parameters</li>
<li>Business logic talks to the required CSLA objects, does some extra stuff to it like sorting the data</li>
<li>MVC controller receives the data, makes some decisions if needed and maps to viewmodels.</li>
</ol></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>richardb replied on Friday, January 11, 2013</h2><p>Sounds like that&#39;s a management / team choice then - do you follow the existing pattern and process or is there a good reason to NOT use the existing pattern.</p>
<p>Your choice - your decision.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 14, 2013</h2><p>If you are using CSLA to create data-centric objects (basically as an ORM) then you are missing out on most of the value of the framework.</p>
<p>CSLA isn&#39;t an ORM, it is designed to help you create a business layer that encapsulates all your business logic. So if you allow business logic to &quot;leak&quot; out of the business layer, then you are compromising your overall application architecture - at least as CSLA is designed to work.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
