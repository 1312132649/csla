<P>- place for discussions with a better editor &amp; notification functionality;<BR>- access to issues&nbsp;is easier and they can be rated by the community;<BR>- the latest source is available and integrates easy with differend source control programs for the csla team members.<BR><BR>and lots more, and the forum won't be down for backup's </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Regent replied on Thursday, November 12, 2009</h2>I hate the community server editor too and I would be happy if CSLA.NET moved to Codeplex, but I think it won't be possible at least because it is only support a bunch of standard licences but CSLA.NET use a custom one...</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, November 13, 2009</h2><P>I have a license for the current version of Community Server. Upgrading apparently takes a day or so - mostly to run SQL scripts, update the software and reapply the minor UX style changes I've made.</P>
<P>If anyone knows CS well, I'm interested in having someone do the upgrade - I clearly don't have the time/interest to do it myself :)&nbsp; If this describes you, let me know.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
