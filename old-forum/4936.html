<P>I'm evaluating to adopt this framework for a new web application but I'm a little confused about the load that is generated on the network by serialized objects. From what I've understood I've realize that each transfer beetween webserver and application server is huge due to the serialized objects. I would like to have some explanation on this.</P>
<P>Moreover my web application will run on a webfarm, is possible to use CSLA in this context? </P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>mine was only a question, and the huge network load is what i've supposed when I've read the serialized object&nbsp;are moving on&nbsp;the network.</P>
<P>Anyway I'll make some test with a sample project. </P>
<P>I see the community is big and alive so this is good start for adopt a new technology.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>

<P>The one scenario that we would expect to use remoting is for a web server in the DMZ of a company that faces the Internet. This web server should use remoting to contact an app server inside the fireall to keep security as tight as possible.</P>
