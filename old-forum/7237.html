Even if you don't change anything on that class (i.e. everything is read-only) your student class should manage the three collections, which should be editable child collections.<br /><br />Is there a context where you actually manage student information separately?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>superkuton replied on Tuesday, July 07, 2009</h2>Thanks for the immediate response.<br><br>In my UI, I present the Student Object (editable root) <br>with <b>read-only child lists </b>of certain records:<br><ol><li>Contact Addresses</li><li>Contact Numbers<br></li><li>Contact Persons</li><li>Training records</li><li>Employment records</li><li>etc.</li></ol>When the user will edit the Training records, an editable Training Object is presented in another form.<br>When the user will edit the Contact Information, 1, 2 &amp; 3 above, I present the editable child collection of the 3 contact information in another form.<br><br>So, to do the editing of contact information, i should create another Student (editable root)<br>which contains the child collections for the 3 contact information. Is this correct?<br><br>Thanks.<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
