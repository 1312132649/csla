<P>Currently i'm using IsDirty Property to change status of cancel button on my forms when CurrentItemChange occurs (Same like save button)..</P>
<P>is this the right way or am i missing some property which exposes whether Undo is available on object or not...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, February 13, 2007</h2><P>That should be correct.</P>
<P>However, there is a protected EditLevel value available, so I suppose you could use that to create a public IsUndoable property or something. If EditLevel is greater than 0 then undo is technically possible, even if the object hasn't been changed.</P>
<P>Or you could combine the two: returning true only if IsDirty is true and EditLevel is &gt;0.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Vinodonly replied on Wednesday, February 14, 2007</h2><P>Thanks for your help.. can this property also be added like other properties (IsDirty, Issavable etc.) as this can be useful.</P>
<P>I have one more issue, in cancel button click event i'm calling CancelEdit which is undoing all the changes, so if i have changed 3 fields it is changing all the 3 fields.</P>
<P>I have added a BeginEdit call&nbsp;in <FONT size=2>CurrentItemChanged, hoping that this will give me field wise undo capability but that is not happenning.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Infact after beginedit call, canceledit is not undoing any changes...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>can you pls help in that..</P></FONT></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 14, 2007</h2>






 





<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If you are using a bindingsource control, which I recommend,
then you should NOT call BeginEdit, CancelEdit or ApplyEdit directly on your
object at all. Instead, you should call CancelEdit and EndEdit on the
bindingsource (you don&#8217;t need to call BeginEdit at all &#8211; that&#8217;s
automatic).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
