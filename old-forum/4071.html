<p class=MsoNormal><span>It could be the network drive. Remember that .NET treats network
drives like they are part of the Intranet, and so files from those locations
aren&#8217;t trusted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, 2008 Pro RTM.&nbsp; I've deleted and retyped the
line... maybe I'll copy and paste it from PTracker, which seems to work.<br>
<br>
Could there be a problem because my reference points to a mapped network drive?&nbsp;
Copy Local is set to true though, and nothing else has a problem with the
assembly refering to that location.<br>
<br>
I'll try some things and see.<br>

</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 21, 2007</h2>I found the problem; I copied the Csla assembly to my desktop and referenced it in my project, and it works fine.&nbsp; Everything else works from the network location, so I'm a bit suprised the designer isn't.&nbsp; I guess my next step is to try to get .Net to trust that location via IE's trusted sites, or the .Net 2 control panel.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 21, 2007</h2>Here's the fix; just use the .Net 2.0 Configuration snap-in to specifically trust that assembly on the network drive.<br><br>I tried adding the drive to IE's trusted site, and having .Net trust fully all Trusted sites, but instead of file:///r:/* it would change it to file:////dev_server.&nbsp; Grr.&nbsp; <br><br>Fixed now though.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
