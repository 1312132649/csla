Similar to clone, but the user is left with a new instance with a copy of most of the data already filled in.<br /><br />I am having a problem on a form where I switched to BindingSourceNode to manage the BindingSources for the root and child objects.  <br /><br />Where this is a problem is that I used to have code in the Duplicate method of the BO which did a Clone, then called ApplyEdit on the clone.  I guess this used to work, but no longer does (the child objects have a EditLevel of 2, and the root now has an edit level of 1 after the apply edit... previously I suppose it was all 0, because it was all working).<br /><br />So I was looking at fixing the code, but now I'm questioning whether or not the BO should be responsible for fixing the edit level, or if the UI should do it.  <br /><br />I would think the UI should be responsible for this by unbinding and applying edit before the duplicate, but I'd just like a reality check.  Is that the right way to go?  I'm not worried about the user not being able to hit cancel in any of the grids because a new window will be opening anyway.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Andy</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, October 13, 2009</h2><P>I suspect the only answer is to safely unbind the object from the UI (so editlevels are all 0), then do the clone, then rebind.</P>
<P>Remember that Clone() is a real clone - warts and all - of the object <EM>as it is when cloned</EM>.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, October 13, 2009</h2>That's what I thought.  I'll remove the appy edit from the BO's duplicate and do the work in the UI.<br /><br />Thanks!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
