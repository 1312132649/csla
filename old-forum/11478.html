<p>I have backported the changes necessary to support multiple binding sources on a single object to CSLA 3.8.3 source.</p>
<p>It is still a mighty struggle when dealing with a complex object graph. In fact the Multiple BindingSource sample in 4.0 has a logical bug which further confuses the issue of proper implementation. (I will make a separate post reporting that)</p>
<p>After further reading, I determined that I would try using DisableIEditableObject. My project does not need N Level Undo.</p>
<p>My experience has been surprising. It appears from my proof of concept work, this is by far the easiest way to work with multiple binding sources in a complex object graph, at least for 3.8.x</p>
<p>I just want to make sure I am not missing something.</p>
<p>Per Rocky from a post long ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/p/3947/19406.aspx#19406">&quot;The specific rule is that you should never call the *Edit() methods on the business object <em>while it is data bound to a bindingsource</em>.&quot;</a></p>
<p>Does this rule apply if I am using DisableIEditableObject set to true in my objects?</p>
<p>Does this rule only apply to root objects?</p>
<p>I have child objects in a list that are each bound to an there own instance of a BindingSource contained in a custom control. I do not unbind them when I call Root.ApplyEdit() or Root.CancelEdit() and it seems to work fine.</p>
<p>AM I missing a possible gotcha by not unbinding the child objects?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
