The paging controls (like the label that shows the current page) have to be updated manually&nbsp;anyway (in the Select event of DataSource Object).</P>
<P>Why can't I just bind the Business Object directly to the DataList and update the Pager's display controls manually? Am I missing something or it's another separation between the UI and the Business Objects Layer?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Amir replied on Tuesday, October 09, 2007</h2><P><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>Amir:</strong></div><div></P>
<P>Let me ask it this way:</P>
<P>What's the advantage of using CslaDataSource in this case (Paging is done in Database)?</P>
