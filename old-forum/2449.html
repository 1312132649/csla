<P>been developing one of editablebusinessbase classes, working good. I basically have private variables like</P>
<P>Guid _id;<BR>string _propertyName = string.empty;<BR>int _plotSize;</P>
<P>Do i need to initialise _plotSize to a number? I know i have to with strings as it doesn't bind if its null.</P>
<P>Then i have various public properties like</P>
<P>public string PropertyName<BR>{<BR>get </P>
<P>etc</P>
<P>All fine and now i need another property that will&nbsp;be "Property Type" which will contain things like "house", "office", "farm house", "land", "apartment" etc.. so I presume i create another BusinessEditableBase for property types this i am ok with... but then how do i create the property on my original EditableBase class above, i could put</P>
<P>private MyNewEditableBase.PropertyTypes _propertyTypes;<BR><BR>public MyNewEditableBase.PropertyTypes PropertyTypes<BR>{<BR>get</P>
<P>etc..</P>
<P>But this would tightly couple the 2 objects wouldn't it??</P>
<P>I don't think i need some kind of Assignment type object like in the csla.net book as its only a 1 to 1 relationship... It is a real estate(property) record and one the of fields/properties on the object will be of a type EditableBase (as it can be modified at a later stage..)</P>
<P>A little lost, can anyone give me a little input, thanks in advance..</P>
