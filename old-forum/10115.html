<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After creation of a&nbsp;</span><span>TriggerAction and binding it to a button the following question pops up:</span></p>
<p>How do you organize your TriggerActions in the XAML? It seems like there will be a</p>
<p>whole bunch of&nbsp;<span>TriggerAction for things like Save, AddNew.</span></p>
<p>And must I declare two separate&nbsp;<span>TriggerAction to get a Save Button and a Save Menu Item?</span></p>

So you need a different TriggerAction to listen to each UI event of each different UI control.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the only option out there, and if this approach disturbs you, one option is to evaluate some of the other options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commanding</li>
<li>Various commanding frameworks that make commanding more broadly useful</li>
<li>Expression Blend SDK trigger event and behavior concepts</li>
<li>Solutions provided with various UI and/or MVVM frameworks out there</li>
<li>SL5 event binding (when SL5 comes out)</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, Microsoft didn&#39;t provide a comprehensive solution in the box - certainly not one that does everything we all want, and also works with the VS designer and with the Blend designer.</p>
<p>So everyone has had to create some solution of their own.</p>
<p>TriggerAction is the third solution I&#39;ve come up with - after InvokeMethod and Execute. It isn&#39;t perfect, but it is (imo) better than the previous two attempts.</p>
<p>I really like the Blend SDK solution, except that attached properties aren&#39;t supported by the VS designer, so that solution forces you to type lots of XAML by hand...</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
