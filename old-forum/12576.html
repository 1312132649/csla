<p>In thinking about advocating for the Xamarin approach here, I wanted to see what the envisioned CSLA support for Mac OS would be.&nbsp; Is that basically done when iOS became potentially supported or is this another ball of wax?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, April 10, 2014</h2><p>Right now we support OS X because mono works there and CSLA works on mono.</p>
<p>If Xamarin provides something more specific than mono for OS X then we&#39;ll adapt to that as necessary.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Friday, April 11, 2014</h2><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I&#39;m probably missing something - apparently they use MonoMac for Xamarin.Mac.</p>

<p>Xamarin.Mac isn&#39;t using mono, then?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
