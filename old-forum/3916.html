<P>Me and my team are new to the CSLA and need to get up to speed quickly. I have a copy of Expert VB 2005 BO which I have read. However we&nbsp; need to move to CSLA version 3 to take advantage of the latest databinding fixes. We are not using WCF, WPF, etc <EM>at this</EM> time just the .NET 2.0 capabilities. My question is:</P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff>Should I buy copies of the eBooks for version 2.1 <STRONG>and</STRONG> 3.0 or just 3.0? Along with copies of the Expert VB 2005 BO.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Thanks for reading.</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 20, 2007</h2><P>Of course I would like everyone to buy&nbsp;several copies of each <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
<P>But the reality is that you probably only need the 2.1 ebook, if you can figure out the data binding code in the 3.0 version of PTWin yourself. </P>
<P>The 3.0 ebook does include a discussion about the PTWin data binding code and how/why it works. But the majority of the 3.0 ebook is focused on WPF, WCF and WF. So if you can figure out the PTWin code (by looking at the code and/or searching through the forum for the 2-3 threads that discuss the topic), then you probably don't need the 3.0 ebook right now.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>elfstoneUK replied on Tuesday, November 20, 2007</h2><P>..understood... </P>
<P>Thanks Rocky <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 20, 2007</h2>Of course, putting on my sales hat, I should point out that the 3.0 ebook covers the new validation features, the Windows Forms data binding changes, enhancements to the authorization subsystem, the new AutoCloneOnUpdate setting and various other small changes from 2.1 to 3.0. So it is possible that some of those might be of value to you as well&nbsp;<img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
