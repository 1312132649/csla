<P>A developer in my team has a use case that requires a business rules to be dependant on another business rule.&nbsp; We are using CSLA 2.0.</P>
<P>Business Rule A</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Rule B (is dependant on A)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Rule C (is dependant on A)</P>
<P>Business Rule D</P>
<P>In this example Business Rule B and C and dependant on A in that A, B, and C has to give the green light for A as a whole to have a&nbsp;green light.&nbsp; If A is not met, then B and C must NOT be executed.&nbsp; D on the other hand will always be executed.</P>
<P>Any way we can accomodate this use case with CSLA 2.0</P>
<P>Much appreciated</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, February 27, 2008</h2>Good to see you're back. <br><br>I've done this by simply having rule A call rule B and C... something like:<br><br>private static bool RuleA( MyClass inst, RuleArgs e ) {<br><br>bool result;<br><br>result = RuleB( inst, e );<br>if ( result ) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; result = RuleC( inst, e );<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( result )<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // rule A check here<br><br>return result;<br>}<br><br>Of course that stops C and A from running if B returns false, but I don't see a way around that.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Wednesday, February 27, 2008</h2><P>Umm... already thought about that, I was hoping for a solution that did not tightly coupled the dependant business rules by encapsulating them in if statements.</P>
<P>I probably chasing a ghost here :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonM replied on Wednesday, February 27, 2008</h2><P>CSLA 3.0 can do shortcircuiting.&nbsp; Basically you can keep other rules from running for the same property.&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't exactly what you want but it will probably get you close.&nbsp; I'm not sure how you control the rule order (perhaps it is just the order you add then to the validationrules collection).</P>
<P>Inside of the rule:</P>
<P>&nbsp; e.StopProcessing = true;</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
