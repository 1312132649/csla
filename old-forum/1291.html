That is pretty clear.</P>
<P>But what if I want to use a value of the BO instance that can change over time instead of a constant like maxLength. What if I have a Property in the BO named VariableLength and I pass that in as the rulearg parameter? Will the rule be created once and that value be treated as a constant? Or will the rule "look up" the current value of that field in the BO and use it instead? I have a feeling it won;t do that without using reflection - so maybe I should be passing the fieldname to look up instead of the current value.</P>
<P>Comments?</P>

<P>Or you could put the rule implementation directly in your business class and just access the field directly.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, September 21, 2006</h2><P>Rocky,</P>
<P>Thanks for the feedback. I was "thinking out loud" when I posted and came to the conclusion that I would need to pass the PropertyName in RuleArgs and then access it through reflection.</P>
<P>The main reason for doing it that way (instead of building the rule into the BO) is that I am trying to centralize common rules for my BOs. This is working out very well so far. I like the idea of writing the rule once and calling it from many places. </P>
<P>When I get to the point where a rule is unique to a given BO I will probaly embed the method in it the BO so it can access any values it needs directly.</P>
