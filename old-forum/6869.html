It should not be run when ValidationRules.CheckRules is called.<br /><br />I can hack together a solution using the oldschool Csla property declaration (ie, not using SetProperty, GetProperty), but as I'd like to move to that eventually, whats the best way to go?<br /><br />Thanks</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
