<p>The pre-release price has changed as well, as I&#39;m almost done with the series. I&#39;m still on track for being done by the end of July, as there&#39;s just one more video to go.</p>
<p>This latest video segment illustrates how to create an editable root list of child objects, along with a corresponding viewmodel object. That viewmodel is used to create a view using the Silverlight 4 DataGrid control.</p>
<p>The end result is, with very little effort, to have a fully functional in-place editing experience, complete with validation rules displayed.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the demo has also been updated to use an in-memory mock database, and the video briefly walks through the construction of that mock database and shows how the DataPortal_XYZ methods were updated to take advantage of this concept.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
