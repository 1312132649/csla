While adding it as a placeholder might help keep the UI code more similar, it would almost certainly be confusing because it would lead people to believe that the other behaviors are the same as in WPF, and they are not.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jack replied on Monday, March 09, 2009</h2>That makes sense.&nbsp; Thanks.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
