Those files can be placed in their own projects - one for Silverlight, the other for .NET - and reused across all your applications.</p>
<p>They are in the business projects only for simplicity, not because they need to be.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Wednesday, May 26, 2010</h2><p>Rocky,</p>
<p>I thought I heard you talk about compression in one of your videos, but now I cannot find it.&nbsp; Do you still remember which video it was?</p>

<p>So I think video 4 is what you need.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Thursday, May 27, 2010</h2><p>Thank you, thank you, thank you Russ Blair.&nbsp; May you live long and prosper.</p>

<p>Okay, so I am creating a &quot;Server&quot; side project with CompressedHost.cs and CompressionUtility.cs files; and a &quot;Client&quot; side project with CompressedProxy.cs and a link to the CompressionUtility.cs.&nbsp; (&nbsp;I have three &quot;business&quot; projects - they each have a different namespace and assembly.&nbsp; I suppose I can give them a single namespace and put them all in one assembly - if that is necessary or even&nbsp;preferable (I&#39;m a glutton for punishment :).) </p>
<p>Then I would include these projects in the references on the appropriate side. I already have references to the files in the zipbin.&nbsp; I still have two questions. </p>
<p>First has to do&nbsp;with the line in App.xaml.cs: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Csla.DataPortal.ProxyTypeName = typeof(<strong>Business.Compression</strong>.CompressedProxy&lt;&gt;).AssemblyQualifiedName;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here Business.Compression is the namespace, and since&nbsp;I have three of them, how would handle it &nbsp;(unless I consolidate them in one) - or is there another way.</p>
<p>Second has to do with the name of the Service in Web.Config.&nbsp; Do I create three different services with four WcfPortal.svc files (with different names, of course).</p>
<p>I seem to be talking myself into a single consolidated namespace and a single assembly - just keep the code files in separate projects.</p>

My examples often put it in the business projects - but that is just to keep things simple.</p>
<p>In a bigger app you would absolutely want to have a client assembly with the compression proxy, and a server assembly with the compression host - and those would be entirely separate from your business assemblies.</p>
<p>In reality, you&#39;ll probably have your own client and server projects anyway - to contain things like your custom base classes, rule libraries and that sort of framework-related stuff. That&#39;s a good place to put the proxy and host code.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Tuesday, June 15, 2010</h2><p>I got it - and it works. It works even on the server (can you believe it!!!) Wow.&nbsp; Life is good.</p>
<p>Thanks Rocky</p>
