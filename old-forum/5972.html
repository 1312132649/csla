The problem is in my winform, the errorProvider does not show unless the severity is error. Is there a way to always have error provider show if there is a rule broken?&nbsp; Is there another errorProvider type control out there?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, December 10, 2008</h2>Yes, there's another control you can use with Csla instead of the ErrorProvider.&nbsp; It's on the Cslacontrib site.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Wednesday, December 10, 2008</h2>Just as an aside, the DevExpress controls suite supports&nbsp;an enhanced data error info interface (very easy to map/translate from the CSLA broken rules), so this is another bonus for moving to DevExpress if you had considered going&nbsp;that route. If you implement the interface, then you get Information, Warning, and Error indicators throughout the control suite (grid, forms, etc). </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, December 11, 2008</h2>Also, CSLA .NET 3.6 includes the PropertyStatus control for WPF and Silverlight, which understands severities and also understands property-level authorization rules.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
