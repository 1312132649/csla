<P>First off, the association that my business root contains a child collection is not represented.&nbsp; I have to manually choose to "Show as Association" for each property to make the representation accurate.&nbsp; It's a pain but it's feasible.&nbsp; Does anybody know a global method of changing these (assuming the children are classes defined in my project since you obviously would&nbsp;not want that functionality for .NET framework types)?</P>
<P>More importantly, I'm noticing that there is no visual association between my child collection and my child object.&nbsp; Further, I can't seem to manually provide one (without changing the code - which I don't want to do).&nbsp; Is this a limitation&nbsp;where the class designer hasn't caught up to the framework (regarding generics)?&nbsp; Or am I missing something else?</P>
<P>I understand this may not be specifically a CSLA question but any CSLA user wishing to see visual representation of their class diagram has surely seen this issue.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DansDreams replied on Thursday, July 12, 2007</h2>I was VERY excited about the class designer when I first looked at it, especially given the apparent bulls-eye on the round-tripping aspects.&nbsp; But I quickly found it to be really inadequate for a complex solution like we're building with CSLA.&nbsp; I don't remember all the details, but the general feel of what you describe sounds familiar.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
