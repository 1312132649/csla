It&#39;s really new (read: not mature) and I have some reservations about using it as opposed to a framework such as CSLA that has a lot of years behind it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agatha seems to offer a lot in the dependency injection/IOC arena. In other ways it seems to mirror a lot of the functionality I see in CSLA.Net.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my knowledge of CSLA is only book knowledge at this point as I have been evaluating it along with other frameworks so I&#39;m hoping that someone can shed some light on the pros and cons of Agatha vs. CLSA.&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>yummyfish replied on Tuesday, January 17, 2012</h2><p>I found my answer: Neither.</p>
<p>After some serious discussions and a lot of reading I have come to the conclusion (whether wrong or right) that Agatha and CSLA both embrace what appears to be the &quot;Loosey Goosey&quot; SOA anti-pattern (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954638.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954638.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>I&#39;m a big fan of many of the features that CSLA offers. It&#39;s possible that it offers something like versioned objects or other features that I don&#39;t know about. But I think that solid N-Tier architecture involves service contracts.</p>
<p>I&#39;d be happy to be proved wrong or hear the insight of others with more experience.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, January 17, 2012</h2><p>Hi Josh, </p>
<p>No, CSLA does not embrace the &quot;Loosey Goosey&quot; pattern. </p>
