Not using a framework. Not using the code generation options that come with using CSLA. <br>
<br>
Assume framwork saves you 20 to 25% of the coding effort. And Code
generation another 20 to 25% of the effort. The cost of not using it,
and doing everything yourself is 40 to 50% of the development effort. <br>
<br>
How big a system are you building? I'm currently involved in one 2 to 3
year offshore project using CSLA and&nbsp; expect to save a substantial
amount of money during its development.by taking advantage of CSLA. But
funily enough, I'm funding that project from money earned working at a
place using an older programming language, where they won't invest in a
framework, and where nobody bu me uses code generation, and yes
everything is taking at least twice as long. Actaully, much longer then
that, as most of the code being produced by others is procedural, and
each developer follows his own flaveor ("standard"), so everytime you
try to reuse anyones code, its a learning exercise, and also needs to
be considerably refactored to be more OOP like for efficient reuse.<br>
<br>
Bottomline, CSLA will not increase your costs, if you use it well. But
as I've indicated, I could not convince my main client of that,
however, I believe in it so much, that I'm investing my own money in a
separate project that uses it.<br>
<br>

<P>But if your apps require n-tier, and you're comparing designing and developing with CSLA to no framework at all, CSLA WILL save you a LOT of effort.&nbsp; And I believe the savings are approximated well in the&nbsp;earlier reply.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Be sure and take at least SOME advantage of the code generation capabilities that supplement this great framework, too (no matter what tool you choose for that).&nbsp; It really is a separate topic, of course.&nbsp; But to miss out on the opportunity to save the effort eliminated by code generation of your business classes would be a real shame.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There are other frameworks to choose from and I have no experience with any of them.&nbsp; But if you are going to try and make some comparisons between CSLA and another framework, be sure and take the community support into consideration.&nbsp; The "peer" support here is awesome and Rocky is here frequently, too.</P>
<P>You&nbsp;may not&nbsp;realize the gains on your first project; there is, after all, some learning curve here (and with your code generation tool, as well).&nbsp; But the savings on future projects will make it well worth the climb(s).</P>

In looking over the code samples provided to me, it appears the comparison is between CSLA and Datasets. This strikes me as apples or oranges as that actually boils down to a decision between <EM>Business Objects</EM> or Datasets, which is a different matter entirely.</P>
<P>I would agree that intially it is much easier to drag and drop a table from Server Explorer to create a Dataset that provides generic support for SQL databases, which is what I have generally done historically. However, I also agree with Rocky on the value of using Smart Data in order to contstrain business logic and prevent diffusing it throughout the application, which will eventually become a maintenance and support issue.</P>
<P>I have not looked into any of the code generation aspects regarding CSLA applications. Sounds like this is an area I need to do additional research.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
