<p>For couple of months I&#39;ve been working with CSLA framework and I&#39;ve been very positive about all the features. They are just great. However, I ran into making the whole application currently working on being <b>3-tier application</b>. So I created WCF data portal and put the logic server-side except...</p>
<p>...except local LINQ to SQL logic.</p>
<p>So here is the question:<br /><b>Are LINQ to SQL executing actions server-side or only local-side.</b></p>
<p>Here is snippet from what I use:</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;using (var ctx = ContextManager&lt;LoginDataDataContext&gt;.GetManager(Database.LoginData))</i></p>
<p>Will using the context trigger the actions on the server or will they remain on local machine ?</p>

<p>If your app is to be a true 3-tier application then all data access (including Linq2SQL) must happen on the serverside.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Hurty replied on Sunday, January 29, 2012</h2><p>Thanks guys... but if my LINQ2SQL code (posted above) it <b>not</b> included in DataPortal_ZYZ() methos would that code still run on server or will be local only?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Sunday, January 29, 2012</h2><p>Only code in DataPortal_XYZ&nbsp; or Objectfactories or called from within these methods are executed on the server. </p>
<p>IE: All code is cleintSide code except for code that is called by:</p>
<ul>
<li>DataPortal.Create</li>
<li>DataPortal.Fetch</li>
<li>DataPortal.Save</li>
<li>DataPortal.Delete</li>
<li>DataPortal.Execute</li>
</ul>
<p>from the client. The DataPortal will add context information and depending on configuration send the object to the server and call the method on the server. </p>
<p>For more detailed information I recommend the <b><i>Using CSLA 4</i></b> ebooks from Rocky.</p>

Have the books from Lhotka, but haven&#39;t met anything about remote LINQ. And as you&#39;ve said I should move my LINQ2SQL code to <b>DataPortal.SOMETHING() </b>to execute on the server.</p>
<p>A lot of thanks for the clearness. </p>
