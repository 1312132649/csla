<P>But I would lean toward:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private int _clientId</P>

As a result they should only be used as first drafts or in really simple Use Cases.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lprada replied on Tuesday, July 10, 2007</h2>Cannot find the link, can you send to lprada@gmail.com</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jupp replied on Tuesday, July 10, 2007</h2>Hi, please look at <A HREF="/forums/post/3047.aspx">http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/post/3047.aspx</A></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
