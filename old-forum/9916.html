<p>This is book 2 of the series. The next book will be <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Access</em>, followed by <em>Using CSLA 4: Security</em>.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">In the different types of UI, that you enumerate, and in the list of the seven books, I don&rsquo;t see WinForm.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Dominique</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 05, 2011</h2><p>CSLA 4 does support Windows Forms, in fact I put in a fair amount of effort to make sure Windows Forms remains supported. The <em>Creating Business Objects</em> book discusses the collection types that exist specifically to support Windows Forms.</p>
<p>The thing is that Windows Forms itself is no longer in active development at Microsoft, so it hasn&#39;t changed for the past 5 years. All the Windows Forms information in the <em>Using CSLA 3.0</em> ebook remains completely relevant today. The only difference in CSLA 4 is that you need to use the new collection base classes when building your collections, otherwise there&#39;s simply nothing new.</p>
<p>So I <em>might</em> write a Windows Forms ebook at the end, if I have time before .NET v.next and CSLA v.next come out, but it isn&#39;t a high priority because it isn&#39;t like the content doesn&#39;t already exist.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dg78 replied on Wednesday, January 05, 2011</h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin;">Yes the content (for Windows Forms) already exists but with a big difference : </span><em><span lang="EN" style="font-family:&#39;Calibri&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;color:#333333;mso-ansi-language:EN;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;">Using CSLA 3.0</span></em><span lang="EN" style="color:#333333;mso-ansi-language:EN;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin;"> ebook cover all the core concepts around using CSLA 3.0 (it is like the first four ebooks you are writing), it is not truly a ebook covering how to use a CSLA .NET business layer to create applications as you will do for the others UI.</span></span></span></p>

<p>I&#39;ve already inhaled most of Creating Business Objecst.&nbsp; Great job.&nbsp; I know you are a busy guy but do you have a tentative schedule for the next release?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I was in Miguel Castro&#39;s training class some years back and I had a conversation with you at Fuddruckers regarding how nice it would be to have (in a perfect world)&nbsp;2 different CSLA books; one focused on framework, and one focused on using CSLA.&nbsp;.&nbsp; These ebooks seem to be much more towards the usability angle than your apress book, which has me absolutely thrilled!&nbsp; It&#39;s already been&nbsp;well worth the prepay.&nbsp; Highly recommended.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 10, 2011</h2><p>A schedule for the <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Access</em> book you mean?</p>
<p>I&#39;ll start working on this when I get back from my current trip (so tomorrow), and it will take around 3 weeks to put out the draft.</p>
<p>Teresa is done editing the first book, so that will move out of draft sometime this week. She&#39;ll start working on editing book 2, and that&#39;ll take 2-3 weeks too, then that&#39;ll go out of draft.</p>
<p>Basically it takes around 3-4 weeks per book, but in real time it can take longer as I get little writing done as I fly around the country for other aspects of my job.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Monday, January 10, 2011</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>emathias<br></b></p>

<p>Realistically&nbsp;though, I just don&#39;t see how the time / money / energy for a CSLA inner workings book can be&nbsp;justified since I have a feeling (I&nbsp;may&nbsp;be wrong as usual) that the absolute great majority of&nbsp;people (99.5 %) don&#39;t care about inner workings..... and who can blame&nbsp;them, with so many new technologies being&nbsp;thrown&nbsp;at us so often, who has time to learn the nuts and bolts!!??</p>
<p>What I would like to see though, is a LOT more comments on the CSLA code itself... I mean, given&nbsp;enough&nbsp;time, everything can be figured out, but its just nice to have those extra inline&nbsp;helpful code comments&nbsp;here and there.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>emathias replied on Monday, January 10, 2011</h2><p>Interesting.&nbsp; Never saw that thread, but it pretty much sums up what I&#39;ve thought also.</p>
<p>I know from talking to other .NET gurus that authoring books for one of the big companies is not exactly&nbsp;a path to retirement riches.&nbsp; Some have hinted that it&#39;s almost not even worth the effort&nbsp;except than for the name recognition it brings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully the ebook &nbsp;route will prove lucrative enough that projects such as what we&#39;re discussing here will become much more feasible.&nbsp; Like most of us here, I don&#39;t mind paying more if it saves me effort, and Rocky&#39;s latest will certainly do that!</p>

<p>On page 16, under the section:&nbsp;<span>&ldquo;<strong><i>Table 6. Elements defined by IPropertyInfo in Csla.Core</i></strong>&quot;</span></p>
<p>The Description for the PropertyInfo DefaultValue says:<span>&nbsp;Gets the default value for a new instance of the property</span></p>
<p>I think you need to add more details to the description. I think you should add a note indicating that default values are only good for value types, CSLA derived reference types don&rsquo;t&rsquo; work because the instance would be shared between all classes so it would have different parents.</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>Later on, at the end of page 33 &nbsp;you have some sample code as follows:</p>
<p>private PersonEdit _person = PersonProperty.DefaultValue;</p>
<p>Perhaps you should indicate there that if the default value was not null, doing that may not be a good idea (assuming that &quot;PersonEdit&quot; is a reference type.</p>
