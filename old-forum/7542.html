<P>I was trying this to subscribe to the PropertyChanged event (event parameter PropertyName will be "") but this event is called twice. (Csla.Core.UndoableBase.UndoChanges(int parentEditLevel=1 and Csla.Core.UndoableBase.UndoChanges(int parentEditLevel=1).</P>
<P>So finally I don't known how to trap the Cancel event only once?</P>

Then you tap into the Clicking or Clicked (before/after) event of the action extender.  The CommandName of the button that caused this event to fire on the extender will be available in the event argument.  <br />This should help you out.<br />Miguel</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>alef replied on Tuesday, September 01, 2009</h2>Thanks. This solves my problem.<br>Just for curiosity. Why is the PropertyChanged event called two times?<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
