I compiled CSLA 3.7 and CSLA Light 3.7<br />without any problems.  I changed the references in the Rolodex solution to<br />Project: Rolodex = CSLALight in ClientBin<br />Project: Rolodex.Business.Client = CSLALight in ClientBin<br />Project: Rolodex.Business.Server = CSLA in Bin<br />Project: WcfHostWeb = CSLA in Bin<br /><br />I also had to cast the last parameter of BaseSalary to (decimal) in order to compile.<br /><br />I compiled.<br />I changed the database .mdf to point to the correct folder for my install.<br />I set the startup project to Web and the startup page to Default.aspx<br /><br />I can run the app and get the logon page, but it never calls the database (per SQL Profiler) and the logon always fails.<br /><br />I believe I need to change a .config file to make the app work on silverlight, but I have been unable to deduce exactly what change or changes are needed.  The download page says that we need to "Use the data portal to communicate between <br />client and server".  This is what I have not figured out.<br /><br />I added:<br />	<br />		<br />	<br /><br />To the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig in Rolodex, but that made no difference.  Does anyone know what other config change I  might need to make to get this demo app to work on Silverlight?<br /><br />Thanks for your time.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>shannon.stewart replied on Monday, August 31, 2009</h2>One thing you could try is to open up the Properties window of the Solution and select "Multiple Startup Projects".  Set the action of the Rolodex and WcfHostWeb to "Start".  This should attach to both projects, and when you try to log in it should show where the error is happening.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>shannon.stewart replied on Monday, August 31, 2009</h2>Actually, I meant set the action of the Web project and WcfHostWeb project to "Start", not the Rolodex project.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TempAccount replied on Tuesday, September 01, 2009</h2>Thank you very much Shannon.  I had forgot about that feature and will certainly need it for my silverlight development.  Once I turned this on I discoverd that my database connection string was not attaching on the fly; so I manually attached the Rolodex database, then used connectionString="Data Source=.\;Initial Catalog=Rolodex;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;"<br /><br />I'm in business now!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
