I envisage it will take around a day to do this and will pay whatever you think is a fair rate.</P>
<P>As I am located in a regional area in Australia I was planning to do this via telephone and a shared terminal server session on our server here. It doesnâ€™t have to be done all in one block, and I may need several follow up sessions to refine things.</P>
<P>I have been using CodeSmith with the templates from the CSLA .NET Contrib project to generate most of my objects, so it would also be very helpful if you have an understanding of these templates.</P>
<P>For more information please send an email to <A href="mailto:dl@chamsoft.com.au">dl@chamsoft.com.au</A>.<BR></P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
