<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I noticed that in one of the business objects in the example project, the business object calls a command object to check if a certain item exists. I am wondering, however, if it is possible to do something similar where the command object calls one or more business objects? I'm thinking this would be useful in cases where there is a complex business process, some of which require some business objects, and the entire thing could be managed by a command object.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, June 25, 2007</h2><P>Absolutely! This is one of the most powerful benefits of using mobile objects: the objects can be used on both the client and app server as needed.</P>
<P>In your DP_Execute() method you can most certainly create, fetch and otherwise interact with other business objects.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
