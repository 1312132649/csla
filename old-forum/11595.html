<p>Although the primary focus of 4.5 is to support WinRT and .NET 4.5, it does also support .NET 4 and Silverlight 5. And there are some really big changes to the data portal to support async/await, and to the business rules engine thanks to a lot of work by Jonny.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, September 25, 2012</h2><p>Downloaded Beta 1 to start to see how things look with our larger SL application.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t been plugged in tremendously to what needs to happen to get up and going with the beta, but perhaps you can shed some light.</p>
<p>I extracted the source.zip and attempted to open the solution - </p>
<p>within Core, I have Csla.Net4 and Csla.Silverlight projects loading OK, and Csla and Csla.WinRT reading (incompatible) and (unavailable) respectively.&nbsp; I&#39;m assuming this is expected?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Regardless, it looks like you have the async targeting DLL and the Entity Framework DLL in there, so I&#39;m not sure why I can&#39;t compile the two projects.&nbsp; It seems to not recognize the async &amp; await keywords as valid.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Any input would be appreciated as to what step I might be missing - thanks!</span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 25, 2012</h2><p>Ahh, well the solution and projects are all built using VS12, not VS10.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure you can&#39;t get any of this stuff to build with VS10 because you don&#39;t get the new VB/C# compilers until VS12, and we use some features from the new compilers.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, September 25, 2012</h2><p>Well that would explain the problem then eh? :)</p>
<p>Thanks, guess it&#39;s time to upgrade.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, September 25, 2012</h2><p>fwiw, you should be able to use the pre-built .NET 4 Csla.dll assembly (and the other .NET 4 assemblies) from VS10 via nuget or from the bin folder created by the installer. The same is true for Silverlight 5.</p>
<p>You only need VS12 if you want to build CSLA yourself, or obviously if you want to create .NET 4.5 or WinRT apps.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiziano27 replied on Wednesday, September 26, 2012</h2><p>Will there be an ebook for 4.5?, When is expected to be released?&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, September 26, 2012</h2><p>I don&#39;t have a specific schedule for the &#39;Using CSLA 4 Version 4.5&#39; book(s). I do know that I have plans for a video series and I&#39;ll probably do that first, so the books won&#39;t be until sometime in 2013.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
