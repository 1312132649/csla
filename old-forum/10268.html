<p>I have a Editable root object that has a BusinesListBase in it. Within that list I have a collection of BusinessBase objects. The ListBase and Businessbase objects are both marked as children.</p>
<p><br />It&#39;s not a problem to get the root object to save itself, but I cannot understand how the collection of BusinessBase objects are supposed to be saved. Since&nbsp;the collection container and businessbase objects are all marked as children they can&#39;t issue thier own save methods right?&nbsp;The only savable methods exist in the root object so are you supposed to &quot;pull&quot; a childs value up to the root and save it from in there?</p>
<p>Whats the perfered setup for a situation of Editable root with lists of children in it?</p>
<p>I apoligize if if question is basic and stupid,&nbsp; I just can&#39;t understand the idea of what should be going on.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, April 15, 2011</h2><p>This is discussed in Chapters 17-18 of <em>Expert 2008 Business Objects</em>, and even more thoroughly in the <em>Using CSLA 4: Data Access</em> ebook.</p>
<p>The basic answer is that the parent calls FieldManager.UpdateChildren&nbsp;(to update all children) or DataPortal.UpdateChild (to update a specfic child).</p>
<p>Then each child type implements Child_XYZ methods to do insert/update/deleteself operations. The correct Child_XYZ method is invoked by the data portal based on the metastate of each child instance.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
