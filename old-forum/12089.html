<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a case : on my UI I want to do something like display a window or refresh some label base on the result of validation on my certain property and display an error too for INVALID state</p>
<p>BUT as long as I know the result of validation is add on BrokenRulesCollection when InValid, so My Idea is to check on BrokenRuleCollection for that property. </p>
<p>And My Question is I want to check the result as soon as the rule is executed, how to do that ?</p>
<p>Is there any features like hook a callback which is executed when validation finished ?</p>
<p>Note : I use MVVM on SL / WPF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>another sugessstion is welcome </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p>

<p><ol>
<li>Hook into PropertyChanged event and update status (this is what the PropertyStatus does)</li>
<li>Hook into ValidationCompleted event</li>
</ol></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>st3fanus replied on Thursday, July 25, 2013</h2><p>Hi jonny, nice quick respond.. :) thanks a lot before</p>
