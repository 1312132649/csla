<p>Are there any other samples in there we should ignore completely or is that the only one that hasn&#39;t been updated or...?</p>
<p>(I&#39;ve got the 4.1 ebooks and the videos but I really learn best from having an working example to refer to and my main source of frustration with learning 4.1 is the lack of one good comprehensive sample like projecttracker used to be.)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, February 21, 2011</h2><p>ProjectTracker is the only non-functional sample to my knowledge. We went through and removed all non-functional samples shortly before the 4.1 release.</p>
<p>It was a concious choice on my part to leave ProjectTracker in the download, primarily because I plan to update it as part of the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook project, and it required less work to leave it in svn than to remove it and re-add it later.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
