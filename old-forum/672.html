I changed them to use the checkstate enum from the System.Windows.Forms namespace to allow me to initialize them to indeterminate for databinding, authorization&nbsp;and rule checking.&nbsp;It&nbsp;seems inappropriate (bloated)&nbsp;to add a reference of that type to a&nbsp;CSLA BO class.</P>
<P>So do I recreate it&nbsp;or just reference it (thus guaranteeing compatibility with form objects) and&nbsp;not worry?</P>

I tried to open the source to look, but I only moved the assemblies to this machine. D'oh! It didn't seem to be a problem, so I thought I'd reenforce my claim to the crown as&nbsp;King of Stupid Questions. My boss loves to needle me on best practice questions.</P>
<P>Just downloaded the 1.53 zip again. :-]</P>

<p class="MsoNormal">You want to try to avoid using the System.Windows.Forms namespace
in your business layer.<span>&nbsp; </span>It typically
means that your UI logic is creeping into you business layer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your business layer should be completely
independent of any UI.<span>&nbsp; </span></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>pelinville replied on Wednesday, July 19, 2006</h2><DIV>Is there a reason you couldn't just create a Enum in the CSLA namespace that has the values you need? </DIV>

<P>Basically, it already exists (reinventing the wheel argument), and as noted, the namespace is insignificant to size&nbsp;the assemblies. I did create the enum in my library, but I needed to ensure it would match what is expected for databinding on forms, so&nbsp;I'd using the same&nbsp;namespace&nbsp;meets the requirement. When researching the definition, I found a mix of order for it, so getting just the right one was problematic without using it.</P>
<P>Now if this were going web, I'd rethink it more, but it's not.</P>
