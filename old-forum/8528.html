<p>In any event. I&nbsp;know that CSLA should work&nbsp;in this environment.&nbsp; But does anyone have any specific experience with CSLA and Caliburn that they would be willing to share?&nbsp; I&#39;d just like to know if there are any pitfalls, tips, etc. before I start.&nbsp; I have not used Caliburn before, so I don&#39;t want to repeat mistakes if I can help it.</p>
<p>TIA</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
