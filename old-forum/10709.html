<p>For those of you&nbsp;who have multiple CSLA apps that use a remote DP, how do you go about structuring your DPs in IIS?&nbsp; Do you use one IIS application per project?&nbsp; Do you use one IIS application to host all of your&nbsp;WcfPortal services for WPF apps (using the IWcfPortal contract), and another for Silverlight apps (using the Silverlight.IWcfPortal contract)?&nbsp; Or do you use one for your entire organization that all your apps use?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I currently have, but again I&#39;m confused and not sure if this is necessary or ideal:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://server/MyFirstAppSilverlight">http://server/MyFirstAppSilverlight</a>:&nbsp; uses basicHttpBinding with the Silverlight.IWcfPortal contract</li>
<li><a href="http://server/MyFirstAppWPF">http://server/MyFirstAppWPF</a>:&nbsp; uses netTcpBinding with the Hosts.IWcfPortal.contract</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of doing the above, should I just have one service for the app (like <a href="http://server/MyFirstApp">http://server/MyFirstApp</a>) that contains the service endpoints for WPF and SL?&nbsp; Or even beyond this, should I have something entirely more generic so that all future CSLA apps could partake...such as <a href="http://server/CslaDataPortal">http://server/CslaDataPortal</a>?</p>
<p>Any guidance is appreciated.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, September 22, 2011</h2><p>You should generally have one virtual root per application. That virtual root can expose a .NET endpoint, a Silverlight endpoint, or both types of endpoint.</p>
<p>Each virtual root is an &quot;IIS Application&quot; of course - but what you should really be considering is <em>your</em> application, and how each application should have its own virtual root so it remains isolated from other applications. This helps improve overall managability, and avoids cross-contamination of data, configuration, and user information. It also helps ensure you can version each application independently.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>TSF replied on Thursday, September 22, 2011</h2>Thank you!!</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
