Use reflection to get the field, or put your rule method in your class and then you can access the field directly.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>bgilbert replied on Wednesday, November 28, 2007</h2>Rocky,<br><br>Thanks. What I was missing was the fact that my rule method was in another class. Moving it into the calling class will work great.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
