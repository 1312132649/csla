<P>This has nothing to do with CSLA but I'm hoping one of you may have solved this.</P>
<P>When you link partial class files to another project (for Silverlight) the files lose their grouping.<BR>I have edited the Silverlight project file and added the required &lt;DependantOn&gt;ApplicationList.cs&lt;/DependantOn&gt; lines to all of the necessary files but the project still lists them ungrouped. Has anyone found a work around for this? It doesn't break anything but it's pretty annoying. :)</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
