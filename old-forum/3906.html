<P>My stored procedure parameter names (90% anyway...the CRUD generated ones) match the column name.&nbsp; So I am thinking about making a constant for each of my column names and then the writing an extension method to preface each one with the @ so I can make them a parameter...</P>

<P>You are not crazy.</P>
<P>I did something like this for some table driven values. (Like Permissions.) e.g. I have a table of permissions and as new records get added then I periodically run my code gen template against the data to re-gen my constants for permissions. Then they show up in Intellisense and I get compile errors if I change something I shouldn't have.</P>
<P>I also do it for Session state handling so I can get strong typing and intellisense.</P>
<P>I don't see why you can't do something similar for your SPs.</P>
<P>If you add them to a metadata table (in some DB - not necessarily the one you ship) and then run your code generator against the data you will find it makes things easier in the long run. Also more consistent.</P>
