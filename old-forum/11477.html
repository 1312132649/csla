Practically all of the changes have been in the Web project housing the SL app.</p>
<p>Expecting no issues I tried to start the app using&nbsp;internet explorer&nbsp;9.&nbsp; To my surprise, ie would simply freeze when I clicked the button that would start the SL app.&nbsp; I tried repeatedly and everytime I had to use the Task Manager to kill the explorer.&nbsp; The explorer freeze occured when the Xap file had just finished loading (using Fiddler)&nbsp; Xap file is 1279 KB.</p>
<p>I then used Chrome, and suddenly everything worked - or so I thought.&nbsp; The same occured with FireFox.&nbsp; Once I got my joy under control, I realized that, using Chrome,&nbsp;the data in the SL app was a bit unfamiliar.&nbsp; The person&#39;s account number was the same, but the name, address birthdate, none of them were familiar.&nbsp; It turned out that the data was coming from a different website on the same server where the App had been installed a few months back.&nbsp; That website&#39;s data is in a different instance of Sql Server. &nbsp;At first I thought that I have messed up my connection strings. But that was not the case.&nbsp; Also a closer attention to the SL app made it clear the this was not my new version, but the old one.</p>
<p>Following the process in Fiddler has shown the strangest thing I ever saw.&nbsp; As soon as I click the button to load the SL app, passing the Person Id as a parameter, I see the URI change from my new site to the old site, and from then on I am working with the old site.&nbsp; Actually the change required is merely in the part of the uri that is the name of the website, and it takes place with surgical precision.&nbsp; In other words it doesn&#39;t appear to be due to some data corruption.&nbsp; From where in the world does Chrome know that a similar app exists in that one, of the few others on that server, that has a similiar - albeit old - app.</p>
<p>Now my head is spinning.&nbsp; I do not know why ie always freezes up&nbsp;(I must have tried 2-3 dozen times).&nbsp; I have even tried shunting the SL to a different, largely empty, Page. Sometimes it works, but mostly it freezes.&nbsp; I have created and re-created my ServiceReference.&nbsp; I have even copied them from my older - working - versions of the project.</p>
<p>I would really, really appreciate some words of wisdom.&nbsp; What could I possibly be doing wrong!&nbsp; The app works perfectly locally on my machine.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>One consistant issue is that the Xap file is never seen to be loading in Fiddler.&nbsp; Interestingly, I can leave the ServiceReference.ClentConfig file unchanged, in other words pointing at the same&nbsp;website, but start the program locally (clicking F5).&nbsp; The app runs fine, Xap file is seen loading fine - but locally.&nbsp; I can then create a new entry and save it and it get saved on the server!</p>

Deleting and then&nbsp;creating one with with the same name continued the same bad behavior.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
