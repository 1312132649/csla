<P>Most rules that are embedded are simple like this one.</P>
<P>But there are a few which are *very* large due to the amount of logic required.</P>

<P>just a short addition from me</P>
<P>I've been using <A href="http://groups.google.com/group/CslaGenerator">CSLAGEN</A> for sometimes, it generated our CSLA object in partial class so we can put any customizing in the non partial class. (it has so many awesome functionaly)</P>
<P>as for the cutom validation rules, I usually create my rules thru this generator and i will set the rule to get the status from a custom function. hoped it usefull</P>
<P>regards</P>
