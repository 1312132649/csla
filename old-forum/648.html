<P>Does anyone else have issues with IE crashing when browsing this forum?&nbsp; I get it at home and at work and it is starting to get really annoying.&nbsp; Sometimes it happens when I click on a link and the page starts to refresh and other times I am only scrolling down a page using the mouse wheel.&nbsp; Not seen this&nbsp;on other sites.</P>

<P>I've not had FF crash at any point, so it must be something to do with IE itself. Since I haven't customized CS, it is probably a CS issue - and I know they are coming out with an update in the near future - hopefully that'll fix it.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>razorkai replied on Monday, July 17, 2006</h2><P>Hi Rocky.</P>
