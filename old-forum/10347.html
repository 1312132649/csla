<p><span>Right now my Company is planning for Building the Very Large ERP
for Education Domain Applicatoin, with the Use of Office365 &amp; Sharepoint 2010 Online. I&rsquo;ve
use the CSLA.Net with my many ASP.Net Applications, and all of them are working
fine. But as my this project going to be Sharepoint for UI &amp; Data Storage, my
All the Data will be comes from the Sharepoint Services(SPList, And Sharepoint
Libraries). So Can I use it CSLA.Net for my Business Layer, and Sharepoint
Services as my Data Access Layer? Can Anyone describe their experience of CSLA.Net
with Sharepoint 2010 or later version of sharepoint. <span>&nbsp;</span>And Howmuch can I deal with Workflows with use
of my Business Objects. Weather CSLA.Net support the Sharepoint Environment as
much as it supports the ASP.Net???&nbsp;</span></p>
