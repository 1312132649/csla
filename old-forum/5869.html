<P>I just download v3.6vb and after changing the project to turn off OptionStrict (doesn't allow late binding) I still have 78 errors ranging from missing files to C# code present. Did I get a bad download? Is it a bad upload? Is vb just not ready?&nbsp; I also dowloaded C# and it is running fine.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Monday, November 24, 2008</h2><P>To my knowledge VB is a work in progress.</P>
<P>It is not complete or ready for download yet.</P>
<P>Not sure if Rocky still needs more volunteers for translating the C# code to VB. You can always ask and then volunteer. &lt;g&gt;</P>
<P>Joe</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, November 24, 2008</h2><P>The official version of CSLA .NET is now C# only. The VB version is a community project, with volunteers working to keep the VB code in sync with the official version.</P>
<P>This is a big effort. The amount of work that went into creating version 3.6 is non-trivial. To create version 3.6 <A href="http://www.magenic.com">Magenic</A> provided me with 2 full time developers, plus some other developers, plus testers, who worked for 3+ months. While much of that time was spent on CSLA .NET for Silverlight, a substantial amount of that time was spent on CSLA .NET for Windows. But we're talking around 10 man/months.</P>
<P>In fact, this was the driving force behind <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLAIntoTheFuture.aspx">my (very difficult) choice </A>to only support one version as "official". I looked at the prospect of spending the next 10 months of my life re-writing code that had already been written, and just couldn't do it. OK, to be fair, it wouldn't take another 10 months to re-write the code - but I estimate it would take around 3 months. Sadly, that'd be 3 months of my life I could never get back. 3 months where I could have been moving forward, but instead would be catching up to where I already was.</P>
<P>Fortunately, <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?area=4&amp;id=bbe426f7-cd06-482f-bfa7-ec5640296562">several generous people </A>have stepped forward to port the changes to VB. They all have jobs and lives of course, and so this takes time. It is somewhat tedious, painstaking work, and yet it is coming along slowly but surely. I have no doubt that they'll get the VB code working in due course.</P>
<P>My recommendation is this though: if you want to use CSLA .NET to build apps, you should build against Csla.dll built from the C# code. It will almost certainly be the most up to date version in terms of features, bug fixes and so forth. If you want to learn how CSLA .NET works internally, and you prefer VB, then you should look at the VB code. Right now you can look as it is completed, and in the relatively near future you should be able to look at the end result.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
