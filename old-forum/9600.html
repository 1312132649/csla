<p>I have a question about using the Csla mapping method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are developing a medical application. We use many Csla functionalities, which are great!</p>
<p>We want to use the Csla DataMapper because we have a similar structure of business object in the GUI (which is made in javascript).</p>
<p>We use the combination Ext.Direct-&gt;Newtonsoft-&gt;Csla and all actions from the GUI are received in a controller method:</p>
<p>public ActionResult UpdatePrescription(Prescription p)</p>
<p>Newtonsoft provides a way to directly map a Json string to a business object.</p>
<p>However, the business object is a Csla BusinessBase and can only be created by using the Csla Prescription.NewPrescription while Newtonsoft uses a public constructor to create a new instance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using this, it&#39;s not an official Csla object. Also Child object are created using the public constructor and will not be official Csla objects.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a solution for using the DataMapper with Newtonsoft?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Peter</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
