<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>So you only need to set the priority on the rule(s) that you want to have at another priority.</p>
<p>Within the same priority you should regard the sequence as random and insignificant. <br />IE Rules is ONLY sorted by Priority to determine the sequence.</p>
<p>If you have rule chaining as in inner rules in a BusinessRule -&nbsp; the rule engine only have knowledge of the outermost Rule (registered rule)&nbsp; and only looks&nbsp; for this rules Priority.</p>
