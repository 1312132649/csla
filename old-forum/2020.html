<P>I think your idea of having the controls define events is fine and&nbsp;I would&nbsp;handle this type of scenario in a similar fashion.&nbsp; If you are planning on&nbsp;having&nbsp;a lot of these "folder controls", you may want to consider defining one event and having all of the click of the "folder controls"&nbsp;trigger&nbsp;the same event.&nbsp;&nbsp;You could then&nbsp;indicate which "folder control" was clicked in the event args...That way the main form would only have to subscribe to one event and could use the event args to determine which "folder control" was clicked, and therefore which MDI child form to load.....Just a thought.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 22, 2006</h2>Ya, I think that will be my next step.&nbsp; Thanks for the feedback, glad to know I'm not off base.<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Friday, December 22, 2006</h2><P>Yea, empowering the main form with the knowledge of how to respond to the events is a good way to go.&nbsp; It is consistent with CAB and can be stretched to fit MVC - or at least close to it.&nbsp; So, when you find the time to venture into those areas, you've got a head start.&nbsp; My suggestion is try and keep all of the "navigation" logic like this in one place so that it is easier to make changes later.&nbsp; If you start putting logic in the listbar, menus, toolbars, etc., you'll have a much harder time dealing with it later.</P>
<P>Plus, you can have a method in your main form that handles what needs to be done when AllContactsClicked occurs and route to that method from not only the listbar but a menu item as well (if you have one for that function).&nbsp; This ensures that all of your behavior is consolidated and consistent.</P>
