An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format."<br><br>If I open explorer, go to my projects bin folder and delete the files, it works. I really, really do not want to have to do this each time I make a change and try and preview it in the browser.<br><br>I have opened the csla project up, and found this is the only place that references them, hence posting here about it. The references to those two files have copy local set to true, I don't seem to be able to change this, and if I could, personally I have no idea if it would fix it. My knowledge is quite limited on these things..<br><br>Has anyone any idea's why this is happening, the project has not changed since I ran it on my old pc with win xp 32bit.<br><br>Thanks<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, July 23, 2009</h2>Its been a while, but I think for the 3.0x series there's a compiler directive you can set so that Csla won't compile the wpf stuff.  </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Smartie replied on Thursday, July 23, 2009</h2>Would it be possible to explain how you do that please?<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, July 23, 2009</h2><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=ac20fe4c-6afc-4176-bcb4-d74b5a370356">http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=ac20fe4c-6afc-4176-bcb4-d74b5a370356</A></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
