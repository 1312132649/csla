<P>I have an account sign up which is glenntoy and suddenly i can't login in. I tried to click the forget password and it says it will be sent 15 minutes.. waiting for a day.. stil didn't received. Can somebody help me on this? </P>
<P>Although I created another account but i which to use that glenntoy account to be consistent with the other forums I signed up.</P>
<P>Hoping for your kind consideration,</P>

<P>It appears that the email gateway used by Community Server 2.0 can run into issues where it out and out crashes. The gateway is a Windows Service that listens on an MSMQ queue and relays the messages from that queue through SMTP to you. If it crashes, then no email goes out (though it does stay in the queue) until the service is restarted.</P>
<P>At the moment there doesn't appear to be any management or monitoring capability around the gateway other than logging into the server as an administrator (which I obviously can't allow others to do), so the only way to restart the service is to have me log in and restart it.</P>
<P>Over the Memorial Day holiday weekend I was out of town on a family camping trip, and Murphy's Law dictated that the thing crashed <img src="/emoticons/emotion-3.gif" alt="Surprise [:O]" />&nbsp;&nbsp; I restarted it when I got back home.</P>
<P>Hopefully the mail gateway software will get an upgrade and/or CS 2.0 will get some manangement tools for the gateway so I can grant web access to other people so the odds of catching/fixing the issue improves. Until then, we'll just have to live with it. Regardless, this (I think) remains far superior to MSN <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>glenntoy replied on Thursday, June 01, 2006</h2>Thanks Rocky.. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2><P>Had to request my password last week, got the email just fine, but was unable to login, after several attempts, my account was locked down.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thinking that I might of mistyped the ugly password that was generated I then waited 24 hours and requested another password.&nbsp; Got the email just fine again.&nbsp; Tried to login with this new password and it appeared to be working.&nbsp; I would enter my username/password pair and I would get to the next page with no error message - leading me to beleive that I was logged in, but I was not.&nbsp; In fact I was unble to log in for about 3 to 4 days after that.&nbsp; Was finally able to login this morning.</P>
<P>:(</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mark replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2><P>I had the same problem.&nbsp; I ended up adding 'lhotka.net' to 'Allows Allow Cookies' in my privacy settings in IE.&nbsp; Seems to have resolved the login issue, but it still doesn't remember me consistently (works for an hour or two, then forgets me - possibly a cookie expiration?).</P>
<P>Still, having to login (as long as it works) is just a minor inconvenience - this forum is still much, MUCH better than the old MSN forum.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2>There do appear to be some serious oddities with how CS works with its cookies. Deleting the related cookies often appears to resolve login issues - leading me to believe that CS leaves old cookies behind and then gets confused by its own cookies or something.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, June 07, 2006</h2>Hi Rocky,<br><br>I posted this in the other thread (about Remember me), but I can't seem to get FireFox to delete CS cookies.&nbsp; MSDN also uses CS, and even when I clear all cookies, close the browser and come back, they are still there.<br><br>Have you heard of anything like this?<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, June 14, 2006</h2>No one else has found this behavior?<br><br>Andy<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
