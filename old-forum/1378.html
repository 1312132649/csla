<P>A newbie with some preliminary questions I&nbsp;hope someone can answer.</P>
<P>1 ) How to bind NamevalueList to a cbo? Doesn't seem to support Ibindinglist is this right? Does someone ahve a workaround.</P>
<P>2) when I added a raiseevent in a property of my BO it caused errors on the dataportal_update.&nbsp; </P>

<P>Unless you implement BindableList code supplied by one of the members of this forum.</P>
<P>It was written a few years back but is widely used.</P>
<P>Just search for it and you should find the Region of code you need to add to the NVL base class.</P>
<P>Then you can bind easily.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I recommend you use CSLA 2.1 for new projects though.</P>
<P>And I agree - if you need 1.x use the latest version so the pain of upgrading later will be lessened.</P>
<P>The key thing is that BrokenRules.Assert is discontinued.</P>
<P>You need to write rules the way that 2.x uses them and 1.53 is the closest thing to it.\</P>
