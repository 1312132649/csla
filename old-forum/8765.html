Recently I added a new object and modified the form by adding a new tab and grid for the new object and I am now getting this error. When I go to check and see what is now different I am seeing a cast from a BindingSourceRefresh to the ISupportInitialize and it is throwing a cast error on the BeginInit.</p>
<p>I can go into the designer code and get rid of them but anytime I look at the GUI portion of the form they get put back in place. I would love to upgrade to the latest CSLA but our object generator that we use only supports up to 2.4.1.</p>
<p>Has anybody seen anything like this before?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I see you mention adding a &quot;tab&quot; to the form, so I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re using a TabControl.</p>
<p>One problem that we&#39;ve had in the past with Tabs + DataBinding is that the actual controls don&#39;t get initialized until you actually display the tab on which they are located. Maybe the BindingSourceRefresh component is trying to access its associated control(s) during this time ?</p>
<p>Just an idea.</p>

<p>What I have been doing and seems to fix it for a little while is to remove the BindingSourceRefresh and then remove the CSLA reference from the project then add a BindingSourceRefresh back to the form which adds a CSLA reference to the project.</p>
<p>This makes it work correctly and sometimes works for hours and all of a sudden VS puts the Inits back in the designer code. I generally haven&#39;t even changed the GUI portion and am working on the objects and casually looking at the form for one reason or another.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
