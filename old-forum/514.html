For example, I have a collection of users, each has an groupid and an&nbsp;email property. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I need to insure that the groupid + email value is unique. I can do this as a constraint on&nbsp;the sql server, but all I get is a nice exception after I try to save instead of a warning message in the broken rules collection. Is there anyway to do this with the CSLA framework? </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The RuleArgs doesn't seem to contain any reference to the collection the object belongs to so I'm not sure how I can iterate through the collection inside of a rule.</DIV>

If you implement your rule method as an instance method of the child class you should have access to this property.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
