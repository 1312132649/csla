<p>A couple things:</p>
<p>I&#39;m reading through the rough draft of the Data Access ebook (CSLA 4), and have come to the section on DataPortal Exceptions.&nbsp; This section is a bit confusing, as you state that the DataPortalException contains the BusinessException and BusinessObject members.&nbsp; However, these members do not exist for the SL DataPortalException.&nbsp; Maybe you might consider mentioning that so the reader isn&#39;t confused?</p>
<p>Also, what is the best or recommended way to capture the originating exception type from a SL client?&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to throw a custom exception on the server side within a business object, and I would like the client to act accordingly if that custom exception is found within the DataPortalException.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, March 22, 2011</h2><p>That is a good point Aaron, I have forwarded this post to <a href="mailto:errata@lhotka.net">errata@lhotka.net</a> so it gets added to the list of items that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>To answer your question, the .NET exception types can&#39;t flow back to Silverlight. Silverlight doesn&#39;t have most of the same types. So the data portal tears apart the server-side exception hierarchy and uses it to create a type-safe hierarchy with much the same information. I believe the property is called ErrorInfo (?).</p>
<p>You can use the text-based information in that object graph to determine the exception(s) that occurred on the server.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
