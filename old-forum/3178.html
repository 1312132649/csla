<P>The ProjectTracker sample app is a great place to learn from.</P>
<P>Plus, use these forums! </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, July 12, 2007</h2>The 2005 book, followed by the 2.1 ebook.&nbsp; According to the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Roadmap.aspx">road map</a>, another ebook for 3.0 is coming Q3 this year.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jamie.gaines replied on Friday, July 13, 2007</h2>Thanks to both of you for your help.&nbsp; I ordered the 2005 book and it will be here later today.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>josh.kodroff replied on Monday, July 16, 2007</h2>Much of the first half of the book or so is devoted to the code in the framework itself.&nbsp; While it was certainly educational, I didn't find it useful in terms of learning how to use the framework.&nbsp; It also involves what I would consider some advanced .NET topics.&nbsp; Rocky has also sounded off on this and has indicated that the 3.0 printed book may not include this material.<br><br>When you get the book, I would recommend reading the chapters in this order (and refer back to the missing chapters if something goes over your head): 1, 2, 7 - 10, 11 and 12 if applicable, then 3 through 6 if you need to know the gritty details.<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, July 17, 2007</h2><P>I agree, if you are simply <EM>using</EM> CSLA then you can skip chapters 3-5.</P>
<P>But don't skip chapter 6!!!!</P>
<P>CSLA is designed to support&nbsp;behavioral object design (single responsibility-d). Chapter 6 helps introduce a way of thinking about object design that I recommend you consider when doing your own OOD.</P>
<P>A large percentage of the questions on this forum, and a large percentage of issues people face when using CSLA, happen due to data-centric object modeling. The answer is almost always to use behavioral object modeling instead.</P>
<P>It is true that CSLA can be used to implement data-centric object models. And it is valuable in that context. But my design goals are to support responsibility-driven object models, and life is often easier if you buy into that philosophy when using CSLA.</P>
<P>So if you are just <EM>using</EM> CSLA, read chapters 1-2 and&nbsp;6-8. Then read chapter&nbsp;9, 10 or 11 depending on the type of UI you are creating (Windows, Web, Service). If you are using a remote data portal then read chapter 12.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
