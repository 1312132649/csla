I am running the project tracker and just ran into a problem.&nbsp; It was working not too long ago but just stopped.&nbsp; I don't know what happened.&nbsp; Once I login (or try to open any other form than the main form i.e. add resource, edit project) I get the following error.</P>
<P><FONT color=#0000ff>System.IO.FileLoadException was unhandled<BR>&nbsp; Message="The given assembly name or codebase was invalid. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131047)"<BR>&nbsp; Source="PTWin"</FONT><BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Any suggestions on why this is happening and how to fix it?</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>reagan123 replied on Wednesday, August 15, 2007</h2><P>Hmmm. found an article on how to fix it and it worked, but I don't really understand what it did.</P>
