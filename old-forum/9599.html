<p>I was wondering if there is any standard support regarding adding or removing items from a collection in Csla based on business rules.&nbsp; I know the usual answer is to override InsertItem and RemoveItem, but I thought I&#39;d ask again given the new rules subsystem, and that this seems like a fairly common use case.</p>
<p>Is there any way to have a rule determine if Insert / Remove should throw an exception or allow the operation?</p>
