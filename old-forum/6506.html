GetManager would then use these parms with Activator.Create to invoke the corresponding constructor in the ServiceClient proxy generated for the service reference.</P>
<P>The current CSLALight implementation uses the parameterless constructor for the proxy and this &nbsp;"requires" a ClientConfig file to specify binding and endpoint.&nbsp; This enhancement would allow proxy creation without needing a ClientConfig file.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In the environment that I am developing for, the WCF service will be hosted by the web that hosts the silverlight app.&nbsp; The url of this site is easily passed to the Silverlight app by InitParms.&nbsp; Since my&nbsp;app will be installable to sites that I never see, editing a config file will not be possible.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Without this enhancement, I must either a) create the proxy without ServieClientManager, which does not the pass it to the application context; or b) modify the CSLA code myself.&nbsp; I have already made this mod but really do not want to do it every time CSLA updates are released.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, February 25, 2009</h2><P>I'll add this to the wish list, thanks.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
