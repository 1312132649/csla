<p>I didn&#39;t find anything clear about achieving scalability with CSLA. </p>
<p>It&#39;s just made using IIS load balancing between web servers in web farm, isn&#39;t it? But this is possible only if DataPortal is used with WCF proxy. Am I right?</p>
<p>I just want to be sure, if there&#39;s some configuration that can enable scaling between multiple servers.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

Along that line, it supports &quot;block&quot; or &quot;batch&quot; updates of object graphs to minimize communication between client and server - and you can exploit that feature in some cases by using the UoW pattern.</p>
<p>I assume you&#39;ve read chapter 1 of any of the&nbsp;<em>Expert Business Objects</em> books, or the first book in the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series? These all discuss the scalability scenarios at a high level - especially the <em>Using CSLA 4: CSLA .NET Overview</em> ebook.</p>
<p>In short, for a smart client app, as you say, you scale out app servers using virtually any http-based server farm technology of your choice.</p>
<p>For web apps it depends on whether you are deploying as a 2- or 3-tier app. A 2-tier configuration can only scale out if your actual web app was designed for a stateless server, and that&#39;s outside the control of CSLA. A 3-tier web app is almost always less performant than a 2-tier web app, but if your bottleneck is at the data access or back-end processing level then the data portal can help you scale out your app servers just like with a smart client app.</p>
<p>But in my observation, most web app scaling issues are due to the web app itself being constructed to require state (Session or whatever), and CSLA can&#39;t help fix that sort of problem.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Miroslav Galajda replied on Sunday, May 01, 2011</h2><p>Hi, thanks for your answer. I feel little bit confused that I must buy some overview book before I can try it so that I could make some decision about it.</p>
<p>Sorry, I haven&#39;t red any of your books and I&#39;m doing review of CSLA by myself to make a decision for using it. It sounds me more normal to have &quot;try before buy&quot; and the overview should be for free, for example the book you mentioned <i>&quot;Using CSLA 4: CSLA .NET Overview</i> ebook&quot;. And that book is even stated as &quot;<span id="dnn_ctr4344_ProductPage_lblItemHtmlHolder"><span style="background-color:#b2a2c7;">This ebook is a draft ...&quot; </span></span></p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mirec</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, May 01, 2011</h2><p>Fwiw, that book is no longer in draft - that was old text - thank you for pointing that out so I could fix it.</p>
<p>Some people have mentioned that my business model is inverted, which is true. </p>
<p>By all rights, I should charge for people to use the framework (probably a few thousand dollars per developer plus an annual support and maintenance fee), and part of that income would go toward a marketing budget that could fund creation of free content.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve chosen, over the past 16 years and far more than 10,000 hours of work on the framework, to give the framework and samples away for free (crazy, I know), and to charge for the related content such as books and videos.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry you find that confusing, but after all this time I&#39;m not looking to change the model.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Miroslav Galajda replied on Monday, May 02, 2011</h2><p>Hi Rocky, </p>
<p>I really appreciate your approach and your work.</p>
<p>But all I just wanted to say is to have the Overview Book for free and the other advanced and experienced content paid. Because it makes hard for someone who wants to make a good point of view.</p>
