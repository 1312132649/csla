I have converted the&nbsp;classes to use the new property declarations with managed backing fields, and added relevant business rules.&nbsp;There are 58 classes and I have encountered a strange problem in one of them. It is a grandchild&nbsp;and is loaded using deep data from a multiple results set using a Dto. There is no lazy loading. As soon as I stop the VS2010 debugger&nbsp;and try&nbsp;to examine the object the debugging session stops - no warning or error. I don&#39;t get this problem with any of the other children or grandchildren and there&#39;s nothing ostensibly different about this one.</p>
<p>I created a test to load a single standalone object of this type from a dummy Dto. Same problem. I removed the single business rule and got a stage further. The&nbsp;class contains about 8 properties and 3 of them have the warning &quot;The function evaluation requires all threads to run&quot;. One property is a DateTime?, one is an int and the third is a business list base (but in this simple instantiation it contains no child objects). If&nbsp;I click on the evaluation button, the property values appear, and then the debug session terminates.</p>
<p>Also, if I expand the base class and look at the properties, the IsSavable flag has the same warning &quot;The function evaluation requires all threads to run&quot;.</p>
<p>I have tried this on 3 different PCs and all of them exhibit the same behaviour.</p>
<p>I&#39;m about to do the obvious things and re-create the class from scratch, step-by-step but as it&#39;s the weekend I thought I&#39;d post this question to see if anyone else has any suggestions.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
