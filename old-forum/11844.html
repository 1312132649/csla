<p>Taking into consideration the suggestions i have read in this forum&nbsp; i am not using </p>
<p>context.addoutvalue (childlistprop, GetList(param1, param2 ...))&nbsp; </p>
<p>but instead:</p>
<p>loadproperty (target, childlistprop,  GetList(param1, param2 ...)))</p>
<p>target.PropertyHasChanged(childlistprop)</p>
<p>In the windows form user interface, i see that the datagrid which should display the child list is not immediately reflecting the changes from the BO childlist. But whenever i change any other field (bound to other BO properties) in form, <b>related or not&nbsp; </b>to the above rule, then the data is correctly displayed in the grid. Can someone give any suggestion ?</p>

<p>This is the reason Csla.Windows.BindingSourceRefresh exists - to reread the valus from the Property that was changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First make sure that your PropertyChangedMode is set to Windows as for Csla 4 the default is Xaml. When property changed mode is Windows the PropertyHasChanged should normally raise the OnUnknownPropertyChanged event.</p>
<p>If this does not help then you may want to call &lt;bo&gt;.OnUnknownPropertyChanged (a PropertyChanged with NULL or String.Empty as propertyname) to signal reread of all properties or add custom code to refresh the binding. &nbsp;</p>
