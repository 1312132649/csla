<P>We are looking for a documentation tool to create HTML Help files from our VB.NET 2.0 source code. Since the author of NDOC has stopped development NDOC seems only to support .NET 1.1 and third party tools like VBCommenter. Which other tools can you recommend?</P>
<P>Thank you very much.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Tuesday, March 13, 2007</h2>There are some commercial tools out there, if you're willing to pay the price.&nbsp; I haven't used any of them though, so I can't recommend one.<br><br>Eventually, MS will release SandCastle, which should also support NDoc tags as well.&nbsp; If you can wait for that, it might be a good idea to do so, since I believe it will be free.<br><br>HTH<br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Massong replied on Tuesday, March 13, 2007</h2><P>Hi Andy,</P>
<P>Thank you for your answer. Yes, we would pay for a good tool. At the moment we test VSdocman, which seems to be not so bad. I tried the beta of MS Sandcastle and read some articles about it. I hope that Microsoft will work on the usability...</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
