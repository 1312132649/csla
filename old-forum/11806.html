<p>I have developers who are using my BusinessLibrary on the client side. They work with several servers. Switch to one server and Create/Load/Delete and Save BusinessObjects to it. Now, I am searching for a way to throw a ServerNotAvailable Exception when the WCF-Connection has aborted (for example when the server was shutted down or the network has broken). Now, the developers has to handle System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException. I am searching for a central place where I can replace this CommunicationException with a own ServerNotAvailableException.</p>
<p>Can someone help me, how I can do this?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Best Regards, Thomas</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Tuesday, January 29, 2013</h2><p>Hi, </p>
<p>Hook into the static event DataPortalInvokeComplete on the Csla.DataPortal. </p>
<p>This is called immediately after the DataPortal call is completed (whether it failed or not) and you can rethrow your own exception. </p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
