<p class=MsoNormal><span>In this case I would define 2 separate objects for the 2 scenarios.
Your business and validation logic will likely be different and the objects

<p class=MsoNormal>Hello,<br>
<br>
I look through many of the discussions here about switchable objects, but I
still didn't find the solution for my problem. Right now I'm reading the 2008
edition of the book, and several years ago I read the 2005 edition, and I build
one project with CSLA 2.7 two years ago. <br>
Still, the concept of Parent and Child objects is probably the most confusing
part to me.<br>
<br>
My case is like this:<br>
I should build a ShoppingCart object, which will have Products collection with
many Product object. Each Product will contain other business objects as
properties, but this is not what concerns me.<br>
<br>
What I'm still didn't quite get, is how to implement the Product object?<br>
On one hand, it is part of a ShoppingCart, and as such it should be declared as
child object - probably the parent will be a Products collection which will be
the child of the ShoppingCart object.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, when I'm adding new product to the system, it is not part of
any ShoppingCart yet and it is definitely a parent object! Only after the
Product is added in the system, it eventually can became part of some
ShoppingCart object, but this is not a requirement, but only a possibility.<br>
<br>
So, after read all the answers here, I get to the point when as I see it, I
have two options:<o:p></o:p></p>

<ol>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Implement Product as switchable object, in order
     to satisfy my two use cases, or<o:p></o:p></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Define two different objects which will probably
     have different sets of properties - one object which will represent the
     Product when it is part of some ShoppingCart object, and probably in this
     case the Product will have a limited set of properties - only these that
     are displayed to the user when he sees the ShoppingCart. <br>
     The second object will represent the Product when a new Product is added
     to the system and it will contain full set of properties.<o:p></o:p></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>Am I getting it right, or am I completely wrong?<br>
<br>
I will highly appreciate any comments on that!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Krasimir Evtimov<br>
<br>
P.S. If something is not clear, p lease let me know so I can explain it.<br>

Reuse is not the goal. </div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>krasimir replied on Monday, November 16, 2009</h2>Thank you very much to both of you!<br><br>So you both suggest me to go with two different objects. I will try to see how the things will go and will report back when I have something to share.<br><br>Meanwhile, if anyone has a different point of view - please share!<br><br>Thanks again<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
