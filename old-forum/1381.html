I have downloaded CSLA 2.0 from download section of the site. <br><br>I want to start using CSLA Framework in my application. How can I incorporate CSLA 2.0 Framework in my existing Web Application. The project which I have downloaded contains lot of code but I am looking for DLLs which I can add to References of my project. Can anyone let me know how to do this ?<br><br>Thanks in advance...<br><br>Ocean<br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jav replied on Tuesday, October 03, 2006</h2><P>Hi ocean,</P>
<P>After you have downloaded the Csla20, before extracting the files rightclick the downloaded zipfile first, choose Properties, and click on the Unblock button.&nbsp; You need to do that to avoid getting Security warning all the time.</P>
<P>After extracting, you should have a folder called Csla20vb or Csla20c (I think) depending upon you language.&nbsp; Open the Csla project first in your VS 2005 and build the project - it takes only a few seconds.</P>
<P>Then in your App's projects simply Reference the Csla.dll which you will find in Csla20vb.Csla.bin.Debug folder.</P>

<P>I can also warmly recommend that you purchase the book. Not only will it give you the best documentation for the framework and prevent you from running into several problems during your development but you will also help supporting Rocky in his incredible work with this framework and help keeping this community alive.</P>

<P>Actually, you won't have to reference CSLA directly from your Web app. If one follows the design patterns in the book,&nbsp;the business objects are built&nbsp;using the CSLA framework and&nbsp;reference CSLA. The Web app references the project(s) that contain the business objects.</P>
<P>Can't recommend THE BOOK enough. You will learn a lot even if you&nbsp;decide not to&nbsp;use the framework.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>mr_lasseter replied on Tuesday, October 03, 2006</h2>Actually if you want to use the Authization Controls in your Web GUI then you will need to reference the CSLA dll in your app.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
