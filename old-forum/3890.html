<P>Like is the transition of vs2005 CSLA 3.0.2 to VS2008 and CSLA 3.5 going to be as big as I imagine them to be? Or will the real pain come when the new ADO.NET comes out in Feb or so?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Tuesday, November 13, 2007</h2><P>Going to VS 2008 isn't that big of a change.&nbsp; I've been using the beta for about 3 months now, and outside some expected bugs(beta), it has been nice to work with.&nbsp; It has a lot of nice features including targeting which version of .net, so you can upgrade to vs 2008 and keep your projects in&nbsp;.Net 2.0 if you wish.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If you are moving to WPF, while it is very capable, expect a huge learning curve.&nbsp; I'd suggest anyone to grab some books and take a class.&nbsp; It is an entirely different paradigm then forms and the gui tools are still in their infancy.&nbsp; It also isn't the death of forms.&nbsp; Forms still exists and Microsoft expects to continue to upgrade it.</P>
<P>I haven't heard about a new ADO.NET.&nbsp; I was under the impression the .Net 3.5 would be released with VS 2008 at the end of November. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Curelom replied on Tuesday, November 13, 2007</h2><P>A couple of other things... </P>
<P>For my project, going to WPF required only&nbsp;a few minor changes to my CSLA business objects, so that's always good.</P>
<P>Also, as you are starting a new project, I'd recomend using .Net 3.5 and look into Linq.&nbsp; It's a real nice addition to the framework, even if you are not going to use it for database access, it helps with any grouping, sorting, or filtering of collections.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>webjedi replied on Tuesday, November 13, 2007</h2><P>Thankfully and unfortunately WPF isn't on my radar for this project....yet.</P>
<P>I've tinkered with VS2008 and am excited for things like anonymous type and extension methods....how awesome will it be when I can do somestring.IsEmail() makes validation sweet.</P>
<P>I'm holding off on VS2008 (outside of a virtual machine anyway)...until release...hate the idea of uninstalling VS yech.&nbsp; So I'm just doing the membership provider now...it's not very deep and doesn't require a lot of Csla so hopefully I will be able to quickly move to .Net 3.5 and retarget the application easily.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
