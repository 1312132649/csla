<p>Can someone point me to an example of how this is done?</p>
<p>(The methods AddFieldToPropertyMapping and AddPropertyToFieldMapping seem to indicate that this mapping must be explicit rather than relying on matching names.)</p>

<p>The methods you refer to are for more advanced scenarios, usually when building services, when the mapping isn&#39;t simple property-to-property based on the inferred property names. While you can use those concepts in a web app, you usually don&#39;t need to.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
