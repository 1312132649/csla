I tried it as non-static and it appeared to work alright. Is there any advantage to be had by declaring them as static vs. non-static? Thanks.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rxelizondo replied on Friday, August 21, 2009</h2>Interesting, have you tried to create two instanced of the class where you declared the PropertyInfo’s as non-static variables?<br /><br />If so, do you not get an error?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, August 25, 2009</h2><P>I imagine that the amount of memory consumed increases dramatically using instance variables instead of static ones. The static ones are re-used for every instance.</P>

Maybe you could make it work if you figure out a way for RegisterProperty() to be called exactly once per type per AppDomain (which is what happens with the static fields), but otherwise who know what nasty stuff will happen.</P>
<P>Why would you want to take the perf and memory hit of having these be instance level anyway?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rfcdejong replied on Wednesday, August 26, 2009</h2>The fieldmanager throws an exception when u try to register properties after an instance is created, so it should not even be possible to register an property at instance level. It's strange that u can.<br /><br />Dynamic properties is another thing, they can be differend in another case.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
