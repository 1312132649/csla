Many of the ideas in the book will "click" only when you've done them a couple times.<br /><br />I believe you'll find the forum to be particularly helpful if your questions are somewhat specific -- ie, ask for guidance on a particular concept that's eluding you.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
