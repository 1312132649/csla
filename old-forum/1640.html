So far I am running into quite a few issues with it and generating .NET 2.0 code. specifically in the use of generics with collection objects and the base objects use of child collections. I am sure it's not&nbsp;a limitation in the generator as much as a limitation of my knowledge of the generator and XSLT.</P>
<P>So, CodeSmith seems to be adopted here. Is it easy to use with CSLA 2.0 and I believe there are templates already out there for it? Would you guys recommend my moving to CodeSmith and abandoning Dollard's generator?</P>
<P>Thoughts?</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>I personally haven't read nor used Dollard's concepts but I do use the CodeSmith templates and think they are very well done. </P>

<P>It'll be a tooth and nail struggle to convince my boss to purchase that, considering it took him a week to relent on getting me the CSLA 2.0 Business Objects book...</P>
<P>Go figure, guess it's back to Dollard's generator and hoping she contacts me sometime soon.</P>

<P>Just search this forum, I posted a link on an earlier post. If you can't find it, just ask and I'll hunt it down. </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>wjcomeaux replied on Tuesday, October 31, 2006</h2><P>I just downloaded the trial version of 3.2 And will see how quickly I can get accustomed to it. It might be worth $100 out of my own pocket.</P>
<P>Will</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>skagen00 replied on Tuesday, October 31, 2006</h2><P>The templates are available here:</P>

<P>Good luck! </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Tuesday, October 31, 2006</h2><BLOCKQUOTE><div><img src="/Themes/default/images/icon-quote.gif"> <strong>wjcomeaux:</strong></div><div>
<P>Well, I just realized that CodeSmith is not free. :)</P>

<P>But your time is free?</P>
<P>So struggling with a tool that doesn't work right and losing all that time is free?</P>
<P>Codesmith is a great bargain at $100 or whatever it is. I highly recommend it.</P>

<P>Sadly, sometimes life doesn't make sense :)</P>
<P>I actually like the CodeSmith Studio.I'm already spoiled by the IDE.</P>
<P>I wasn't able to find that link to version 2.6. Does it produce the same code results as the 3.2 version does? I might end up giving it a shot before I spend the money here. If the only difference is I have to edit my files in some other XML editor then I guess I can deal.</P>

<P>Codesmith 3.x versions support .Net 2.x.</P>
<P>This may or may not be an issue for you.</P>
