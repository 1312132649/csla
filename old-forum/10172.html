<p>When I modify a root object and cancel the changes, the root object is reverted to its orignial state but its child lists do not&nbsp; always reload. &nbsp; Did anyone experienced this before?</p>
<p>Ex; Have a &quot;User&quot; root object with a list of associated projects.&nbsp; When I cancel changes made to the user, its projects list does not always reload.&nbsp; It usually works fine once or twice but if I keep modifying and cancelling the changes (without reloading the root object from my navigation), at one point the child list becomes empty.&nbsp; </p>
<p>FYI ,I have a Silverlight 4 - MVVM - CSLA 4.0.1 application.&nbsp; My code is devided in Client and Server sides and my child lists are loaded on demand.&nbsp; </p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, March 17, 2011</h2><p>It is possible that you are canceling the root or parent back to the point where it didn&#39;t have a child collection - to where the child property was null, before it was loaded with a value. In that case, the property value will be reset to null and the child collection would be empty.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mr X replied on Thursday, March 17, 2011</h2><p>Thanks Rocky, i will continue my investigation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I now suspect the list not being refreshed in MVVM.&nbsp; I have a ObservableCollection of childViewmodel which are also loaded on demand. maybe that is the one being refreshed.</p>
