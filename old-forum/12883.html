<p>In my SL application in the App.xaml I have quite a few Application Resources of the form: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;vm:PlanViewModel x:Key=&quot;PlanData&quot; /&gt;<br />where PlanData is then used as&nbsp;in DataContext=(&quot;{StaticResource PlanData}&quot;).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Problem&nbsp;comes when I try to enter that line&nbsp;in WPF App.xaml file.&nbsp; When I enter &lt;vm: the intelliSense promptly brings up my list of ViewModels in a drop down, where I can choose &quot;PlanViewModel. But as soon as I finish the line by&nbsp;typing &quot;/&gt;&quot;; an error condition tells me that there is no PlanViewModel in the very exact folder from which intelliSense&nbsp;had me&nbsp;select it!!&nbsp; I have the proper reference to the ViewModel folder as an xmlns:vm line in App.xaml.</p>
<p>When I started with this conversion, I had the same problem with my Converters, like ItemVisibilityConverter.&nbsp; That problem would suddenly appear after I brought in a few of my Page files.&nbsp;Once it appeared, the only solution was to drag everything to trash and start over.&nbsp; Now for some reason all of that is okay.</p>
<p>I have struggled unsuccessfully to find an alternative to using the App.xaml for these resources but haven&#39;t been able to come up with anything satisfactory.&nbsp; Would appreciate some help.</p>
