I need to set a value on Customer when a specific Order type is added.<br>In the Initialize() method of Customer I added this: this._orders.ListChanged += &lt;event handler&gt; as well as override the OnListChanged on Orders. Although OnListChanged is fired, the event handler of _orders.ListChanged never does. Makes me wonder what I have done wrong here...<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, July 20, 2007</h2>If you override OnListChanged, you must call base.OnListChanged or you will have prevented the event from being raised.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
