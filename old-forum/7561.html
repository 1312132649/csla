<br>
I've just put MyCsla for 3.6.3 and never (also 3-6-3-N2) on the CslaContrib site. <a href="http://cslacontrib.codeplex.com/">http://cslacontrib.codeplex.com </a><br>
<br>
The purpose is to give a combined Best Practice and extension points
where we can all contribute with utility/helper classes, validation
rules, components and more. <br>
<br>
<span>Best Practice</span><br>
As a lot of you already has done - I have added my own baseclasses with
extension points for logging/trace and a small sample of how to
add/alter functionality without making modifications to Csla itself. <br>
<br>
As for usage - I prefer to add this project as part of my solution as
this make it easier to extend Csla inside my app and make all my BOs
inherit from these baseclasses. <br>
<br>
Also included are:<br>
<span>Validation Rules </span><br>
<ul><li>Generic (IComparable) rules for GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqual, LessThan, LessThanOrEgual that compares two property values</li></ul>
<span>Custom Windows Controls </span><br>
<ul><li>StatusBarExtender with my implementation of wait animation and an animated splash after 2 seconds.</li><li>SmartDateTimePicker - also accepts text input like +, -, t, y&nbsp; (all these texts are defines in Csla resources and translated)</li><li>BindableRadioButtons - Radio buttons that support databind, typically for use with 2-5 items</li><li>ErrorWarnInfoProvider - Slightly reworked version of the one already available on CslaContrib</li></ul>
And a sample app that demonstrates the custom windows controls. <br>
<br>
The namespace is simply MyCsla and uses the same folder names as Csla. To download the code goto the<span> Source Code </span>tab and select Download. <br>
<br>
I am posting this message on both the Csla.Net dicussions and
CslaContrib discussion. Please post reponses concerning
code/submissions in the CslaContrib forum. <br>
<br>
I have volunteered to step up as overall coordinator of the CslaContrip
and hope that we can tune up on more activity in this project. If you
want to share som code/classes please join codeplex and send me info
(as per home page on the project) or send me email with info about your
code and I can post it. <br>
<br>

Hope you find this useful and want to contribute more code. <br>
