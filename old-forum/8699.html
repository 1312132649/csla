<p>But I can see quite an appeal to being able to host my app on a server of my own in terms of being able to update programs for all my clients at once&nbsp;and on my own schedule.&nbsp; And it would allow me to consider the business alternative of selling hosted service (SAAS?) for a monthly fee instead of the oh-so 90s license fee with a annual maintenance fee.&nbsp; But is this a silly idea?</p>
<p>My admittedly-ignorant impression of the layout for most &quot;regular&quot; web app situations is that data and application servers run in the host&#39;s computing environment and the UI is offered to &quot;where ever&quot; via browser-to-app-server communication over the www.&nbsp; So very little, if any, processing is really going on at the client workstation.&nbsp; And most of the heavy&nbsp;traffic is between the app server and the data server which are local resources to one another.</p>
<p>But for my needs, the data and the UI are both in the customer&#39;s environment and only the server app would be on the web (my) server&#39;s environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me that this&nbsp;would require an awful lot of web traffic to distribute virtually all the objects handled by the program since there&#39;s a whole internet between the app server and the data server in this picture.&nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t the performance be dreadful?&nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t my clients be better served with a click once delivery of software they purchase to take care of the update/upgrade issue and enjoy the benefit of all-local processing?&nbsp; Or have I just been making excuses for ignoring the &quot;web app party&quot; for too long?&nbsp; &lt;g&gt;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>The latency between the user and your server, and then your server and the customer&#39;s data center is likely to be a killer all by itself. Then add the bandwidth demands and it gets worse.</p>
<p>Then add security. Is your customer <em>really</em> going to open their firewall to allow your server to reach in <em>from the Internet</em> and talk to their database? Almost nobody is willing to poke holes to allow direct Internet connections to their database servers.</p>
<p>SaaS works great if you can host the data. But if you can&#39;t host the data it becomes very problematic.</p>
<p>Now if you want to sell an &quot;appliance&quot;, which is a web server that you provide to your customer that they run in their data center, then you might have a better story. Basically you&#39;d be saying you provide an &quot;app server&quot; that provides the UI and app processing, and then talks to the customer&#39;s database without any Internet traffic or firewall issues (well, there are always firewall issues - but these would be typical ones).</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Sunday, March 21, 2010</h2><p>Thanks for the reply, Rocky.&nbsp; As you can probably tell, that&#39;s what I thought.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see any advantage to the &quot;appliance&quot; you describe here&nbsp;over a plain&nbsp;windows app (for me or for the client).&nbsp; Do you?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Typically, only one or two users need access to my programs at one customer site.&nbsp; The kinds of tasks the programs perform only need to be run a few times per month.&nbsp; So I&#39;ve been parking the .msi file out on their server in a restricted folder and let the users just go there to get the workstation software (my program) installed when a new user or new computer is needed to run it.&nbsp; It&#39;s a pretty simple environment to service compared to what most of the crowd here faces.&nbsp; And I&#39;m happy to keep it that way if there&#39;s nothing to be gained for any additional complexity incurred.</p>
