<P>In what I have read, that is to be expected since serialization is used internaly to csla.net.&nbsp; Again, based on what I have read, I think I need to use the DataMapper to map the objects to DTOs (or Dictionary objects) and pass them.&nbsp; Since I have several layers of csla objects to map, and want to hide that work, can I use the OnSerializing events to create the dictionary objects for each csla object and pass that structure through the message object?&nbsp; </P>
<P>Is this the proper thing to do?&nbsp; Has anyone else done anything similar to this?</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoOfMetL replied on Tuesday, February 03, 2009</h2>When I call a service using WCF DataContract classes that are different
