<P>I would like to get some opinion regarding a design problem. In the application I am working on, I have projects and each project can have multiple feature requests. I would like to show, in a treeview all projects and their corresponding feature requests. Simple!</P>
<P>I have made following clases:</P>ProjectList - A read-only list of projects. <BR>ProjectInfo - A read-only project<BR>ProjectFeatureList - A read-only list of features for a project<BR>ProjectFeatureInfo - A read-only feature for a project<BR>
<P>All these are used in two other use cases. First two class are used in use-case&nbsp;'Maintain a project' where a user is presented with a list of projects, he can select one and then edit it. Second two are also used in similar use case for feature requests.</P>
<P>Now in order to show, in a treeview, a list of projects with corresponding list of features, should I use these classes or create a different set of classes?</P>
<P>If using these existing classes, I will have probably write code behind UI, something like:</P>'Get Project List e.g. mProjectList = ProjectList.Load()<BR>For Each mProjectInfo As ProjectInfo In mProjectList<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Get Project Feature List for each Project (e.g. mProjectFeatureList&nbsp; = ProjectFeatureList.Load(mProjectInfo.ProjectID)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fill tree root node<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Each mFeatureInfo As ProjectFeatureInfo In mProjectFeatureList<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fill tree child nodes<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next<BR>Next<BR>
<P>If I use a seperate set of classes then the logic of of getting project list and corresponding feature list will go in those classes. I have a feeling that creating seperate classes is better option as I can then use those classes to fill treeview, nested grids or a combo and a grid or whatever combination. Also the code will not be behind UI and is thus more maintainable.</P>
<P>I would like to get some opinion on this and would be very thankful.</P>

<P>Thanks for your reply.</P>
<P>I am actually looking for a suggestions to make my class design. I am using ASP.NET and the tree view should be ok I guess.</P>
<P>You mentioned that you will have one xxxList and xxxInfo class. Does that mean you will do something like I did in my initial question? i.e. you will put the logic of getting features for a project behind UI? Is that a good way to do this or do you think creating another set of classes is better?</P>
