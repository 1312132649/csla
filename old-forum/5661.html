<P>So I encourage you to use it, find the quirks, and report them to Microsoft so they can (hopefully) address any issues.</P>
<P>It is also possible that CSLA will need to accomodate the WPF grid behaviors too. And ultimately I can see a day (not too far off?) where CSLA will have to stop supporting Windows Forms in order to support WPF. That would be sad, but is a likely outcome if WPF continues to diverge from the established Windows Forms behaviors for interfaces and events.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, October 23, 2008</h2>Hmm..<br><br>I'm really not sure what to do. Unfortunately the Xceed grid doesn't support IDataErrorInfo (well, not the free version).&nbsp; We have purchased the Infragistics NetAdvantage, and their grid is mostly working except for this issue.&nbsp; Then finally the MS grid is still in CTP mode...<br><br>I think I'm going to finish up other areas and come back to this..<br><br>It's interesting though, because I had gotten the impression that WinForms databinding as overly strict (and/or broken) and you prefered Wpf's databinding.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, October 23, 2008</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I do prefer WPF&#8217;s data binding, as it is simpler.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>However, part of the reason it is simpler is because there&#8217;s
no grid control :)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So as the grid control becomes reality in WPF, it complicates
WPF data binding too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>In short, grid controls are the source of much pain&#8230; And
right now in WPF they are the source of a LOT of pain because Microsoft doesn&#8217;t
have one to set the standard. So the third party vendors have been (to some
degree) making things up as they go &#8211; which is clearly a mess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
