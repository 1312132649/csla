<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Public</span>&nbsp;<span>Overrides</span>&nbsp;<span>Function</span>&nbsp;Save()&nbsp;<span>As</span>&nbsp;<span>SoapExamCollection</span>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>DataPortal</span>.Execute(<span>Of</span>&nbsp;<span>ExamAssignedCommand</span>)(<span>New</span>&nbsp;<span>ExamAssignedCommand</span>(<span>Me</span>))
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Return</span>&nbsp;<span>Me</span>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>End</span>&nbsp;<span>Function</span></pre>
<pre><span><br /></span></pre>
<pre><span>What should the SaveAsync look like in this case?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.</span></pre></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
