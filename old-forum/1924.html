The thing is that the controls require a registration (look inside your project and you'll notice that some files where silently added...).<br><br>I _think_ you need to publish or install the app in order for them to work.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, December 07, 2006</h2>Are you talking about the licenses.licx file?&nbsp; I tried adding one to the dll, but that only caused the dll to fail to build.<br><br>These exceptions occur when the build server is building the latest version of the application, so I'm not sure how I'd install my application.&nbsp; It was working fine until I moved some of these methods to a dll so they can be shared among applications... I guess for now I'll move them back.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Thursday, December 07, 2006</h2>Ok, I know this is going to sound really silly, but try this:<br>Add a Form to your new class (first remove that license file you hand added).<br>Add some of the infragistics controls that you use in your app to the form.<br><br>Try now.<br><br>If it builds fine, you should be able to remove the form from your class library project and everything should still work just fine.<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Thursday, December 07, 2006</h2><P>Andy,</P>
<P>Just remove the licenses.licx from your project and recompile.&nbsp; I lost about 2 days on the same problem you're having last year only to realize that when I deleted the file it&nbsp;ended up working just fine.&nbsp; </P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, December 07, 2006</h2>Guyroch,<br><br>I just tried that, and it seems to have fixed the problem.&nbsp; Very weird.&nbsp; I thought those files were needed to properly license the component.<br><br>I've had the file for a while now, even upgraded from 20062 to 20063 and its never caused any problems before.&nbsp; I don't know why now suddenly it wants to..<br><br>So what happens when the file gets added back?&nbsp; Do I have to keep deleting it, or will it now suddenly work again?<br><br>Andy<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>guyroch replied on Thursday, December 07, 2006</h2><P>As far as I know the file will automagically show up again.&nbsp; I just leave it there and delete it from time to time only when this problem manifests itself.&nbsp; Granted, wierd but whatever works is fine by me :)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
