<P>I have an editable root object that contains three editable child objects of an identical type.&nbsp; I am attempting to mark the child objects as deleted as normally would be done through an editable collection's Remove method.&nbsp; The difference here, of course, is that I don't have access to a Remove method or anything similar through the editable root object.&nbsp; </P>
<P>How do I mark the child objects as deleted so I can use the Save method of the root to commit the delete to the database?&nbsp; I can't use ChildObject.Delete, because a child cannot directly mark itself as deleted.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>
