<p>I am looking at upgrading our usage of CSLA to a more recent version. I am only interested in the core functionalities, but the csla.test solution has some silverlight stuff embedded into it, so it was easier just to build the silverlight4 projects as well. When running the tests, I get 5 failures. I was wondering if someone could help me resolve why these tests are failing, if possible. I have attached the trace (.trx file) from the tests.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
