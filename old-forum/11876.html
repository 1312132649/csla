<p>You don&#39;t need to bump a one day old thread.&nbsp; It&#39;s hard to find developers.&nbsp; Good luck finding free ones.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to tell me the obvious. &nbsp;Your &quot;potshot&quot; was no help to me. &nbsp;Your link to a one item list was no help. &nbsp;Can&#39;t add value? &nbsp;Then keep on walking. &nbsp;Do you know what I mean?</p>
