<P>What about the basic stuff ??&nbsp; Automating what I'm sure many of us do ... </P>

<P dir=ltr>to generate properties .... Something that could consume a Visio or Rational UML class would be awsome.<BR><BR>I just realized ... I've never used the Class Designer in VS before ... is there a programming interface for that tool to automate the repetetive stuff ???</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>I've got to be overlooking something obvious.</P>
<P dir=ltr>Please point me in the right direction.</P>

<P>anyone have an alternative ????&nbsp; Something more recent.</P>
<P>I also&nbsp;Reverse Engineered&nbsp;C# project to Visio UML objects ... I'm not sure if there is an API or scripting interface to to search and replace to&nbsp;automate Business Object coding &nbsp;... any help jump-starting or sharing experience with that approach will be appreciated ... ( I hvaven't installed Visio for Office 2007 yet .. but it is available to me )</P>
<P>The Visio solution will be very helpful&nbsp;to develop sequence diagrams ... I'm going to take a shot at documenting Rocky's&nbsp;"deep data" processing using Data Transfer Object.</P>
<P>I'm also going to take a look at the Dollard Code Gen book .... will it cover the basics that I am looking for to get started ???</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>

<P>&nbsp;Steve</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Thursday, September 13, 2007</h2><P>Dollard's book is quite good conceptually. As I understand it, there is little in there for actually getting work done.</P>
<P>Many people use Codesmith to develop Business Objects as it is quite straightforward.</P>
<P>Ver 2.6 is still free if you poke around their website hard enough.</P>
<P>Lots of other code gen mechanisms exist - many are referred to in threads. I forget all their names. But Xal is "in charge" of one that uses Codesmith under the hood. So you can send Xal a message and ask about it if you want.</P>
