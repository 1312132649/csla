I want (someday) to create my own implementation of the Common Language Specification, specifically my own VES (the runtime, if you follow me), in order to use it:<br><br>1. in as many platforms as it is possible (or having any sense);<br><br>2. as a part of a larger project <img src="/emoticons/emotion-7.gif" alt="Tongue Tied [:S]" /> <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" /><br><br>Also, I'd like it's functionality to match as closely as possible to
the .NET Framework, so anyone could use VS tools (if they wish) to
develop for it. <br>
<br>Of course, I know about Mono &amp; DotGNU; what I want here is to develop the runtime with a new perspective, including some ideas I've gathered through my life as a developer. <br><br>BUT... <br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure</a> (see "Standardization and Licensing")<br><br>I'm not sure I'm understanding this. Could it be possible that, if I implement my own VES, by my own means (read "not using ROTOR source code, but using every single piece of CLI documentation available to the public"), and distribute it so everyone can use / develop with / develop FOR it, then someday suddenly MS, HP et al. knock at my doors telling me "sorry, you're screwed BIG TIME, see you at court..." ?<br><br>And, if so, how the %$/$&amp;/$@ did Novell/FSF do to avoid this? (Or even worse, did they NOT???)<br><br>Sorry for the harsh language. This is one of my most cherished project ideas, and it would be a shame (for me, at least) to see it going into the drain because of patent &amp; licensing issues that... um... sorry for this...&nbsp;<img src="/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry [:@]" />SHOULD<img src="/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry [:@]" />HAVE<img src="/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry [:@]" />NEVER<img src="/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry [:@]" />EXISTED<img src="/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry [:@]" />ANYWAY<img src="/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry [:@]" />???? . Whew, felt better.<br><br>Could you people please share your thoughts on this?
