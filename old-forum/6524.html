I've given them a context menu to delete a row from the grid. In one grid, they delete the row and its underlying data is deleted as expected.<br /><br />On the other, however, it doesn't behave the same way. They are built exactly the same way except for their fields. Can anyone suggest where I may have gone wrong? Note the databinding does remove it from the displayed list. It just doesn't remove it from the underlying data store though it traces through OK.<br /><br />I got it to work by doing this in the UI:<br />private void deleteRowToolStripMenuItem1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />{<br />this.defectBindingSource.RemoveAt(defectBindingSource.Position);<br />         Qcpc item = (Qcpc)defectBindingSource.Current;<br />         Qcpc.DeleteByID(item.DefectID); // added this method to get it to delete, shouldn't have had to do this<br />         this.defectBindingSource.ResetBindings(false);<br />}<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />_E</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
