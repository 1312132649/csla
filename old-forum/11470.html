<p>I&#39;m trying to mess around with the ProjectTracker sample project to follow along with some of the walkthrough videos. I am using Visual Studio 2010 and I&#39;m trying to run the sample from CSLA 3.8. I&#39;m getting an error in the Web.config file after I&#39;ve seemingly rectified all the broken references upon importing the project solution into VS.</p>
<p>
<p><i>Could not load file or assembly &#39;PresentationCFFRasterizer, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35&#39; or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I comment that particular line out, it compiles and runs fine, except I get a FileNotFoundException when I click cancel on the Login screen and attempt to navigate to View Project.</p>
<p><i>Could not load file or assembly &#39;System.Data, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089&#39; or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I converted the project from VS2008 to VS2010, could this have caused problems? I was asked by Visual Studio to upgrade parts of the project but I still get the error regardless of whether or not I upgrade. The output also shows the following right after I click View Projects:</p>
<p>
<p><i>A first chance exception of type &#39;System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException&#39; occurred in System.Data.dll</i></p>
<p><i>A first chance exception of type &#39;Csla.Reflection.CallMethodException&#39; occurred in Csla.DLL</i></p>
<p><i>A first chance exception of type &#39;Csla.Server.DataPortalException&#39; occurred in Csla.DLL</i></p>

<p>Thanks for any help that could be provided!</p>

I set the solution to open the WpfUI version as the startup project. I don&#39;t click login, but instead click on Resources tab on the left hand side of the window. It starts loading, and then throws a bunch of exceptions...but the exceptions seem to &quot;fix themselves&quot;...after about 5 seconds.</p>

<p>I &nbsp;had to disable &quot;Just My Code&quot; in the Visual Studio Debugger settings in order to get the application to keep running after the exception was thrown. See above screenshots of what&#39;s happening. Could someone explain why the exception is being thrown and why it &quot;goes away&quot; after a several seconds?</p>
