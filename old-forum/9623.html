<p>Can someone let me know if the current release of CSLA.Net supports Windows Workflow from version VS 2010.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I put a bunch of work into supporting WF in version 3.0 and maintained that through 3.5. However, to my knowledge nobody actually used any of this except me for my demos.</p>
<p>So WF was (and is) at the bottom of the priority list for CSLA 4. The existing code compiles. And it might work, but I honestly don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>Honestly though, the CSLA 3.x support for WF isn&#39;t dramatic. Just some helper types I found useful to minimize the code to invoke a workflow. CSLA business objects work great in workflows, and that&#39;s true in WF 3 and WF 4.</p>
<p>So maybe I should say the answer is absolutely YES, but the rather incidental helpers in the Csla.Workflow assembly may or may not work.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
