<p>I am locked into Windows Phone 8.1 because the project I&#39;m starting requires Bluetooth LE support and that&#39;s only in Windows Phone 8.1.&nbsp; The BTLE support on the other MS platforms is pretty good as far as I can tell.&nbsp; But this is a mobile app and Windows Phones are the target.</p>
<p>So, I realize the no one&#39;s asking about WP specifically for CSLA, let alone WP8.1.&nbsp; Is there a plan at this point to address it specifically?&nbsp; </p>
<p>If I understand things correctly, the Universal App enhancement might solve this problem, but is there a timetable that can be shared for that?</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest an approach in the meantime that minimizes the lost time?</p>
<p>TIA - Bill</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, May 14, 2014</h2><p>I thought Csla already supported WP 8.&nbsp; Isn&#39;t that one of the packages available?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>nhwilly replied on Wednesday, May 14, 2014</h2><p>My understanding is that Windows Phone 8 is supported, but I couldn&#39;t even get that to work.&nbsp; And no, I believe WP8 and WP8.1 are different animals.&nbsp; I am trying to avoid Silverlight because I don&#39;t want to spend time developing and learning the ins and outs when I probably won&#39;t deploy on that.&nbsp; Great product idea, though.</p>
<p>Yesterday I thought I&#39;d just create a store app project that would allow me to add the CSLA Nuget packages just so I could get started building my model. In the time it takes me to do all that, I&#39;m sure the landscape will change.&nbsp; Everything is in transition to a better world and in a few weeks all kinds of support will show up, like Telerik for WP8.1 and so on.</p>
<p>I spent about an hour trying to figure out which Nuget package to choose to add to my project.&nbsp; Never could get any of them to actually completely load without a red message telling me I was adding an unsupported package.&nbsp; So I gave up and just went back to thinking about the objects and their relationships for now.</p>
<p>If you work with all these tools all the time, I&#39;m sure it seems very straightforward.&nbsp; Just an uphill battle getting started from scratch.&nbsp; And I&#39;m not really lazy, just impatient.&nbsp; ;)</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, May 15, 2014</h2><p>If WP8 Csla doesn&#39;t work it might be easy enough to grab the source for the Csla WP library, change it to WP8.1 and recompile.&nbsp; I believe that&#39;s pretty much what is done for mvc, as there usually isn&#39;t too much that really changes.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 21, 2014</h2><p>Windows Phone 8 (Silverlight 8) has been supported since it came out.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8.1 (WinRT) support is in the latest beta and should be released in a couple weeks.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I had to deal with for 8.1 is that there&#39;s no WCF support on the new client, so I had to write a new data portal channel that doesn&#39;t rely on WCF.</p>
<p>That new HttpProxy/HttpPortal channel is also in the latest beta and is available for all platforms, not just WP8.1.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 21, 2014</h2><p>I see from your post that you aren&#39;t real familiar with Visual Studio.</p>
<p>To get at the beta release of CSLA you&#39;ll need to enable the use of pre-release code in the nuget add package dialog. There&#39;s a combobox at the top of the dialog where you can select &#39;stable only&#39; or to use pre-release software. To get at the beta you&#39;ll need to enable the use of pre-release packages.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, now that I think about it, I don&#39;t think the WP8.1 WinRT code is in nuget yet because we haven&#39;t updated the nuget package definitions yet.</p>
<p>So perhaps your only option right now is to grab the CSLA source off GitHub and build it. Or look in the \Samples\Dependencies folder to see if I checked in test assemblies for WP8.1 WinRT.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>nhwilly replied on Thursday, May 22, 2014</h2><p>Oh SNAP.&nbsp; I completely forgot that it would be in beta.&nbsp; I almost never use beta packages because I&#39;m not capable enough to debug things and sort through the rough spots efficiently.&nbsp; I just now tried a store app with the beta setting and it worked great.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This will allow me to start my business classes and I&#39;m pretty sure the framework pieces will be out of beta long before I&#39;m ready to deploy anything.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks, Rocky.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
