Saves a lot of UI plumbing specially when dealing with many binding sources. <br /><br />I've just come across a scenario where it would have been useful to access the "children" collection of the binding source to apply"SuspendBinding" and "ResumeBinding". So my request is, can the properties scope be changed to "Protected Internal" so I can create my own base class and use the underlying properties as needed? Right now they are onlyl internal and I have to modify the csla src to make this change.<br /><br />Edit: And make the Source property Public.<br /><br />This is what my base class looks like:<br /><br />Public Class ATBindingSourceNode<br />		Inherits Csla.Windows.BindingSourceNode<br /><br />		Public Sub New(ByVal source As System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource)<br />			MyBase.New(source)<br />		End Sub<br /><br />		Public Sub SuspendBinding()<br />			For Each child In Me.Children<br />				child.Source.SuspendBinding()<br />			Next<br />		End Sub<br /><br />		Public Sub ResumeBinding()<br />			For Each child In Me.Children<br />				child.Source.ResumeBinding()<br />			Next<br />		End Sub<br /><br />	End Class</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xAvailx replied on Tuesday, June 02, 2009</h2>Actually, just making Source and Children public would work for my scenario. Otherwise I ran into problems with down casting when using the BindingSourceHelper class.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
