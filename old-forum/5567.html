<P>A LINQ query on a produces a resultset of type <EM>IEnumerable(Of T)</EM> which therefore lacks the <EM>BusinessListBase</EM> properties that I'd like to pick up on (eg IsNew, IsDirty, etc) for the UI.</P>
<P>Of course I can create a new instance of my object and iterate through the LINQ resultset to populate it&nbsp;then bind that to the grids as appropriate. But what I'd really like to do is cast the LINQ resultset to directly my type that inherits from <EM>BusinessListBase</EM> (which a long way down the line implements <EM>IEnumerable</EM>).&nbsp; I've worked out that <EM>DirectCast</EM> and <EM>CType</EM> don't work. So the question is: is it possible to return a strongly-typed (ie <EM>BusinessListBase</EM>) object from a LINQ query and if so how?</P>
<P>TIA</P>

<P>You can thank Aaron Erickson of Magenic for this wonderful capability.</P>
<P>I am quite sure it is in the 3.6 code base. Not so sure about 3.5.</P>

<P>Thanks for the tip.&nbsp; I'll take a look.&nbsp; I'm on an earlier code base at the moment.</P>
