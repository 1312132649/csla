<P>I know <A href="http://www.visualwebgui.com/">Visual WebGUI</A> from Gizmox for a long time. A week ago they release version 6.4 Beta (Beta 1b on Jan 28, 2010).</P>
<P>In a nutshell, Visual WebGUI is an framework/environement where the code runs always on the server. The client is a dumb terminal. This is a recurring concept. It all started with dumb terminals and some 15/20 years ago SUN had a concept of running everything on a X Windows terminal - I can't recall how they named it.</P>
<P>From the runtime viewpoint your browser just sends and receive events. Your mouse and keyboard also generate events that are sent to the server. The server&nbsp;executes&nbsp;your C# or VB.NET code and generates events that are sent to your browser. Your browser has a small JavaScript engine that updates the display according to those events. All this server/browser chat uses AJAX so you never submit your web page.</P>
<P>From the developer viewpoint, is much easier (read productive) than ASPX. You don't have to care about a lot of stuff, namely state because there is no state: just a dumb web page. You have design time support like if you were working on a WinForms project.</P>
<P>From the security viewpoint, it more secure than any other solution. No problem if the client is compromised as it runs no application code, just a JavaScript terminal program</P>
<P>You have to take care with dialogs, because the server doesn't wait for the response. The <A href="http://wiki.visualwebgui.com/">Wiki</A>&nbsp;explains in detail with a couple of examples.</P>
<P>I miss some CSLA stuf that is available on WinForms like ReadWriteAuthorization, CslaActionExtender, ErrorInfoProvider, etc. I guess all those WinForms&nbsp;utilities can be ported to Visual WebGUI. Has anyone done that?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Wednesday, February 17, 2010</h2><p><div style='padding-left: 50px;background-color:silver'><b>tiago<br></b>

<p>I guess not. It should be easy enough provided Gizmox solves the problem of casting from System.ComponentModel.Component to Gizmox.WebGUI.Forms.BindingSource (Gizmox.WebGUI.Forms namespace should be a direct replacement for the System.Windows.Forms namespace).</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
