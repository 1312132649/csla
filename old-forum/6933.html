As part of the custom code you obtain the Windows token and "read it" to gather its data. But the values need to exist in the custom Principal and Identity classes.<br /><br />Joe<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>tiago replied on Tuesday, May 12, 2009</h2><P>Hi Jure,</P>
<P>I made some changes to PTracker authentication in order to have Windows Authentication. In fact you just need to change CslaAuthentication attribute. The nicest thing about it is that you can have both at the same time.</P>
<P>If the users that is authenticated under Windows exists in the <FONT face="Courier New" color=#800080 size=2>users</FONT> table, it gets logged on with no further questions. Otherwise (the windows user name doesn't exist in the <FONT face="Courier New" color=#800080 size=2>users</FONT> table) the login window will ask for username/password. This is quite useful when you have an application on a client but your laptop is not in the client's domain. You can still use your laptop and login in the application using the application admin username.</P>
