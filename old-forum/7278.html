For example i will debug on the server and see that the object data is loaded properly FirstName = "Jon", LastName = "smith", but when it gets back to the client in debug i see, FirstName = "smith" LastNamt = "Jon" ??</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonStonecash replied on Wednesday, July 15, 2009</h2>I would check the versions of the binaries on the client and server.&nbsp; This sounds like a mismatch in the execution binaries.&nbsp; <br><br>Jon Stonecash<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JoeFallon1 replied on Wednesday, July 15, 2009</h2><P>It might also matter which version of CSLA you are using. And whether or not you use the new Property syntax or not. The original property syntax reuiqred the use of a forceInit trick to ensure that Properties in an inheritance hierarchy lined up correctly.&nbsp; Newer versions do not require that trick anymore.</P>
