This would make my tests more complete as I would know if my objects failed their serializations (or other issues that might arise).<br /><br />Is there a way to do this? If so could I have a quick example.<br /><br />Thanks.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, December 29, 2009</h2>I discuss this in the <A href="http://store.lhotka.net/">CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series</A>, including code samples showing how to do a mock DAL that you can switch to through configuration.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jnthomas replied on Tuesday, December 29, 2009</h2>Thanks Rocky.
