<p>This is not what I heard.</p>
<p>I heard that Rocky is tired of dealing with the constant technology changes of .Net so he is dropping all Microsoft related stuff and has decided to move on to other more stable technologies such as Unix KornShell programming and Mainframe stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real shame, I was really getting into the CSLA.</p>
