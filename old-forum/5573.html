<P>I'm not sure it's a good idea, though. ROB's are lightweight classes by comparison, so I think you're losing most of the advantage of using a ROLB.</P>
<P>Another similar technique is to just use a BLB or ERLB class, but turn off editing in the UI. Again, though, I think this is missing the point -- having your BO's enforce the behavior while the UI can be agnostic. </P>
<P>As I get better with our code generator I'll probably switch over to dedicated classes.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
