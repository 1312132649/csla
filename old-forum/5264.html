<P>I want to develop a web application and I am not sure whether I should do it in DHTML or Silverlight. I could use the rich UI capabilities of Silverlight, but on the other hand <BR>Silverlight is heavy on the client and not many users installed it. Are there any solutions or suggestions?</P>
<P>thank you very much</P>

I'm not an AJAX expert, but as I understand it, the trick to success with AJAX is twofold:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Pick a good AJAX framework (I'm no help here, sorry)</LI>
<LI>Budget to write the UI at least 3-4 times for different browsers</LI></OL>
<P>I find it hard to get overly excited about spending huge amounts of time troubleshooting every browser out there and tweaking the javascript until it works everywhere (or at least there's a compromise everywhere). Just not my cup of tea...</P>
<P>Silverlight offers a somewhat more consistent environment, though there are still some variations due to browser differences. Far fewer than with AJAX/DHMTL though.</P>
<P>The challenge you'll face today with Silverlight is that it is in beta - and it has a fair number of bugs/quriks. You can usually work around them, but they are there and can cause a quite a bit of pain.</P>
<P>CSLA Light can help to some degree, because we've been working through some of the primary pain points and building the workarounds/solutions into CSLA Light.</P>
<P>But ultimately I think it comes down to this:</P>
<P>Silverlight will allow you to run your business objects on the actual client. You can get a comparably interactive experience to WPF or Windows Forms while doing all your work in C# or VB. With CSLA Light, you can reuse a large percentage of your existing business object code when building a Silverlight application, and <EM>still</EM> get all that great user interactivity.</P>
<P>AJAX/DHTML is still fundamentally a server-side world. Yes, you can run code in the client, but it won't be VB or C#, and you can't easily have the same code running on the client and the server. There's just a substantial impedance mismatch between the client world and server world when doing AJAX. And that can be OK - but you must architect for it, and plan for it, and develop a broader set of skills to do the same work.</P>
<P>Ultimately I am convinced that Silverlight is going to become the dominant platform for business apps - not just on the web, but on the desktop too.</P>
<P>In the short term though, the bugs and quirks in the beta make it pretty comparable to AJAX in terms of the difficulties you'll probably face in using it.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
