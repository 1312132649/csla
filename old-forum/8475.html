<p>This is being done by Blake Niemyjski (of CodeSmith fame), who has very generously agreed to do the upgrade. </p>
<p>It should be the case that login credentials are unaffected, and posts and threads remain intact. But there&#39;ll certainly be differences in the web UI appearance, layout and general workflow.</p>
<p>Of course there are new features (tagging, etc) in the new software, and hopefully it will support newer browsers more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>So this weekend, plan for the forum to be up and down a few times, and possibly offline for several hours at a stretch.</strong></p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rasupit replied on Thursday, February 04, 2010</h2>great news... this is long overdue.
