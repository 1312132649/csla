<P><STRONG>Type is not resolved for member 'MySystem.Library.Security.MyPrincipal,MySystem.Library'</STRONG></P>
<P>I knew this problem had to deal with Cassini, but I'm running on Vista, using Web Applications and don't want to run as Administrator to develop in IIS.&nbsp; So, I found a solution on&nbsp;your website, but I'm curious as to why it is not implemented in&nbsp;the CSLA&nbsp;samples.&nbsp; Basically, the idea is to customize the serialization of the custom Principal and Identity to appear as GenericPrincipal or Identity <EM>only when Crossing App Domains</EM>.</P>
<P>The only gotcha I am guessing would exist here would be if I added properties to my custom Principal/Identity objects that GenericPrincipal/Identity would not carry over.&nbsp; Anything I'm not seeing here?</P>
<P>Thanks in advance,</P>
