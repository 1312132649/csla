I get the error ...<br>A first chance exception of type 'System.IO.FileNotFoundException' occurred in mscorlib.dll.<br><br>FYI, AppSettings("ClientData") returns "Our.DAL.ClientTypes.ClientData,Our.DAL.ClientTypes" just like the downloadable DeepData example.&nbsp; If I take out the ", True, True)" from the line, then dalType is nothing and the error occurs on the Acctivator.CreateInstance.&nbsp; <br><br>I've looked all all I know to, and asked VB forums about this (I know it is not CSLA specific) and have no answer.&nbsp; The problem must be in something that I have not setup.&nbsp; Do any of you have any ideas?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Strick9<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, January 22, 2008</h2>Type.GetType() looks for the type in all assemblies in the execution directory. Are you sure your DAL assembly is in the same directory as the host EXE?</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>strick9 replied on Tuesday, January 22, 2008</h2>Exactly right.&nbsp; <br><br>Thanks for stepping out of your box to help me with the "little stuff".<br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
