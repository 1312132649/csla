<P>If you have some long processing you need to do against the Model after the query completes, you might consider starting that process in an OnRefreshed() override, but running it on your own background thread (I'd suggest you use the BackgroundWorker).</P>
<P>You can set IsBusy yourself - the property setter is protected - so you can use IsBusy when doing your own async operations too.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
