To summarize, there will be around <span>50 nodes</span> ( LAN ) doing some sort of data entry by view a batch of TIFFs allotted to each user/node. These batch of tiffs may be shared by 1-5 users ie a user may have one batch or one batch may be shared by (upto) 5 users. Now my immediate concerns are :<br><br><br><br><ol><li>This is basic and most important. <span>Handling of images</span> : Images will be ftp from client site to the location and centrally stored on a server. They will be made into batches on the server for allotment. Now what should be the design and architecture to fetch images from the server to nodes ( LAN ) so that performance is maximum. No network choking. Average size of tiff will be 300 KB and in extreme cases may go upto MBs ( 1-8 MB very rare but yes). I will be using Oracle 9i for data storage but would not like to store images in Oracle so the option is out.</li><li>I need a .NET compatible <span>image viewer</span>. It should be least
expensive with usual feature like &gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;,zoom,conversion
from jpg to Tif and OCR capability will be added advantage.</li></ol>I am looking forward to your inputs.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>lprada replied on Wednesday, April 18, 2007</h2><P>Hi, mi name is Leonardo Carlos Prada, I work for a Company (<A href="http://www.cardinalsystems.com.ar">http://www.cardinalsystems.com.ar</A>) that has a product to do what you need. please contact me if you want to check our product or if you want help in your project ( we have seen all your problems and solve it).
