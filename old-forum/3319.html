<P>Has anyone gotten this combination to work?</P>
<P>A related question is trying to get CSLA BO's to work with a MMC 3.0 snapin.&nbsp; In both cases I don't have control over the .exe.config</P>
<P>Thanks in advance.</P>

<P>That's allowed be to put my connection strings and other settings to allow the business objects to function.</P>
<P>of course solving one problem often leads to another.&nbsp; Now it appears that I'm losing my user context.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I have a simple Datagrid control that's being bound to an EditableRootList.&nbsp; Even though I've hard-coded my login I'm still getting exceptions because 'CanReadProperty' calls are failing.&nbsp; Looking closer I find that the ApplicationContext.user is empty.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
