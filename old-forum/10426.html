<p>Also I&#39;m interested in the discussion on feasability/effort/scope/difficulty and also why we&nbsp;would&nbsp;do this. &nbsp;What sort of functionality or code structure changes could there be to warrant such an effort. &nbsp;What are the pros or positive effects on code performance/maintenance/ or generation. &nbsp;What sort of new features could be utilized.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>However, CSLA .NET 3.0.5 is also the recommended version for .NET 2.0, because it includes a wide array of bug fixes and features around Windows Forms, and other .NET 2.0 scenarios.</p>
<p>So (imo) nobody should choose to run CSLA .NET 2.x anymore.</p>
<p>CSLA .NET 3.6-3.8 added support for Silverlight, ADO.NET Entity Framework and other .NET 3.5 and 3.5 SP1 features. This also includes support for ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>Starting in 3.6, code reduction was a major focus. So writing classes against 3.8 (current) means writing probably less than 50% of the code from early versions.</p>
<p>If you are using .NET 3.5 or Silverlight, you should use CSLA .NET 3.8.</p>
<p>If you are using .NET 4 or Silverlight 4, you should use CSLA 4, because CSLA 4 was created for this platform.</p>
<p>CSLA 4 also includes code reduction, and more abstraction around the data portal, and support for ASP.NET MVC 3.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BunnyStrider replied on Wednesday, June 08, 2011</h2><p>Great answer!</p>
<p>What do you think about filling this out a little more and making a webpage that could easily show developers the evolution of the framework? &nbsp;Is there such a page already? &nbsp;I tried following the change log but it&#39;s hard to see the forest for the trees.</p>
