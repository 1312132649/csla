<p>I work for a company who have developed a large application using CSLA (quite an old CSLA version I might add - in the region of version 1.x) and we have noticed a somewhat annoying characteristic since switching to hosting the portals in IIS7 from IIS6 - objects on the portal are being cached between calls. This definitely did not happen for us in IIS6 and we have confirmed this by writing a quick test application and running it against IIS6 and IIS7 portals. This seems odd to me as surely due to the nature of a web server, the calls should be stateless (unless it&#39;s some subtlety related to .NET remoting?).</p>
<p>The issue is not a huge one as we can work around it but it is more of an irritation and I&#39;m curious as to whether this behaviour is by design and if anyone else has noticed it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>
