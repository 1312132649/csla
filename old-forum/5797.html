<p class=MsoNormal>In the UK, the main site often goes down (or is down) in the
morning (UK time between 9am &amp; ??12 maybe.)&nbsp; The forum is up nearly
all the time.<br>

<P>So it must be something by the current hosting machine, Magenic?<BR>Maybe it's an idea just to host the site on another machine or location which doesn't need to go down?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, December 10, 2008</h2><P>The server is down due to a software failure with virtual server, and I'm working to resolve the issue.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.lhotka.net">www.lhotka.net</A> is currently hosted on my personal server. I've been burned in the past by hardware failures, where I've had to waste days reinstalling the OS, reinstalling and reconfiguring all the various software running on the server - blogs, wikis, source control, etc.</P>
<P>forums.lhotka.net is hosted on a server at Magenic, because I don't have the bandwidth to handle it.</P>
<P>So some time ago I settled on a solution that (thus far) has been proof against catastrophe. My server is a virtual machine. Every night (my time) the VM is shut down and the vhd's are copied to another directory, then the VM restarts. Then the vhd's are copied to an external HD. Every couple weeks a copy is also made to an external HD that is effectively offsite. Oh, and the physical server's HD is mirrored.</P>
<P>The backup scheme used by Magenic is similar, and is motivated by a similar desire to avoid hard failure scenarios.</P>
<P>Is this ideal? Probably not. But I am not an IT pro guy. Nor do I make money off the framework, the forum, my blog, etc. Sure, I have some ads, and they just barely pay for the DSL service - they dont' generate enough revenue to pay for hosting a virtual machine somewhere - not even close.</P>
<P>To be blunt, I am sorry if it makes the framework feel "unprofessional". For me this is a labor of love. I put ridiculous amounts of time and money into this framework so I can give it to you for free. But I can't justify spending thousands of dollars on hosting services unless I can come up with a way to pay for those services. That money would come directly out of my family budget otherwise, and you can probably see where that makes no sense.</P>
<P>In fact, I'm switching my hosting to Magenic's servers entirely in the near future, because I don't find enough value hosting in my home any longer. For years it has been fun - a learning experience about aspects of Windows I don't normally deal with (security, configuration, backups, etc). But as time goes on, I find the value decreasing and the PITA factor increasing, so I'm going to move my virtual machine to their servers. That'll save me DSL bandwidth, and a few hundred dollars a year in electricity.</P>
<P>But Magenic's virtual machine backup scheme is essentially the same as mine - a nightly copy of the vhd's to an external location - so I'm afraid the daily downtime won't change in any meaningful way...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Kevin Fairclough replied on Friday, December 12, 2008</h2>Delegate it to Magenic, seems like the ideal solution, or move it all to Google?&nbsp; Seems mad to have to host it yourself, if you are not charging for the framework.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Kevin Fairclough replied on Tuesday, December 23, 2008</h2>I take that back about Magenic, the forums were down most of my day on Monday.&nbsp; This is becoming quite a problem especially when I'm relying on them so much to learn.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
