<p>I can scroll up or down and left and right with no problem; however, when I select a cell it there is a 2 second pause between when I click on the cell and when it gets highlighted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clicking from cell to cell several times will leave a trail of blank cells that get filled in 2 second intervals until the last cell selected is highlighted.&nbsp; The draw speed is horrible.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read several articles on optimizing things - don&#39;t use automatic resizing, don&#39;t use individual cell formatting, and so on - but so far I still get that 2 second delay when clicking between cells.&nbsp; Again, this is after the record set has been opened.&nbsp; Nothing fixes the problem.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have this problem?</p>
<p>Do anyone else have a datagrid that may be used instead?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
