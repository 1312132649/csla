<P>Button1.Databindings.Add("Enabled", MyBO, "IsDirty")</P>
<P>but can not set it up to a custom readonly property in my BO:</P>
<P>Button1.Databindings.Add("Enabled", MyBO, "HasItems")</P>
<P>This later binding throws the error: "Cannot bind to the property or column HasItems on the DataSource"</P>
<P>It doesn't make sence</P>

But binding to the "IsDirty" or "AllowEdit" actually works with no errors</P>
<P>my custom readonly property "HasItems" is what is failing.&nbsp; Why is that?</P>

<P>However, that has no bearing on why your custom property isn't working.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ward0093 replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2><P>correct... also... I am setting these bindings up threw code at runtime... not in the designer</P>
<P>I keep reading posts on " <B>PropertyDescriptor "... do I need this for my custom properties?</B></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mark replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2><P>I wouldn't think you'd need to mess with PropertyDescriptors.&nbsp; Obviously, CSLA doesn't use them, and data binding works fine.</P>
<P>Other than verifying that the data source you're assigning actually does expose 'HasItems', I can't think of anything else to check.&nbsp; Sorry...</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Mark replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2><P>You should be able to do this.&nbsp; I've done the exact same thing in the past.</P>
<P>Only thing I can think of off the top of my head is to make sure your property is public (I know I sometimes forget).&nbsp; Not sure that makes much difference, because data binding depends on reflection quite a bit, but it's something to check.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ward0093 replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2><P>actually... binding to AllowEdit... fails as well.... but IsDirty and IsNew all work fine...</P>
