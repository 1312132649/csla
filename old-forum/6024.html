In first section displaying the object A details, second part contains object B details.&nbsp; Apply data only when clicking on Apply buttons. The object structure is like the below:<br>Main Object: Business Base<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object A : BusinessListBase<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ObjectB : BusinessListBase. ObjectA, Object B are properties of Main Object. <br>&nbsp; Coming to the aspx page, I have added 2 items to Object A collection. After that added added one item to object B collection. Then clicking the Apply button on the first part(Object A collection). This time after saving the Object A data into database, CSLA saving the Object B record also into the database eventhough they did not enter any information for that record(Because In memory I created the Object B). Due to this CSLA, creating the some unnecessary records.<br>I am doing the save like this:<br>&nbsp;MainObject.Save(); <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Could we save only one particular object related to Save instead of saving the all in memory objects.<br>Thanks in advance<br><br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>SonOfPirate replied on Friday, December 19, 2008</h2><P>Keeping in mind that your objects should reflect the use case, it sounds like you should not be calling MainObject.Save() because this will behave exactly as described.&nbsp; Instead, call ObjectA.Save() or ObjectB.Save() based on which button was clicked.</P>
