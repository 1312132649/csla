<P>Can I even debug because I not using ASP.NET Development&nbsp;Server?</P>
<P>When I select view in browser I get a message saying I am not authorized to use this page.&nbsp; I am sure it is something simple that I am not using.&nbsp; I usually struggle getting my web apps up and going anyway.&nbsp; I appreciate&nbsp;any ideas to fix this problem.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;</P>

You do this in the IIS console by bringing up the properties for the virtual root and clicking the button on the first page to create an "application" for the directory.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Cider replied on Tuesday, June 06, 2006</h2><P>Thanks for your quick response.&nbsp; I believe that it is set up as an application.&nbsp; In IIS when I press properties under by virtual root PTWeb the form that pops up has a section called Application Settings.&nbsp; It lists the Application Name as PTWeb.&nbsp; Doesn't this mean that it is set up as an application?</P>
<P>I should also mention that I reinstalled IIS and that (along with adding file myinfo.dll to C:\windows\system32 and registering myinfo.dll and scrrun.dll) I no longer get the application error.&nbsp; I only get the error that I am not authorized to use this page.</P>
