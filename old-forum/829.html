When a product code is keyed in, the valid price is retrieved and shown on the grid. </P>
<P>The problem is as follows:</P>
<P>When a user inputs a quantity, the object calculates the extended price for that item (qty*price), however, this does not show-up in the ExtPrice cell until I have moved off the row.</P>
<P>I have tried adding the BindingSourceRefresh to the form. but to no avail.</P>
<P>Any suggestions gratefully received,</P>
<P>TIA</P>

<P>The problem is, I can enter values in a row (quantity, price) etc, move off those cells (so the edit is committed) and still the calculated sells are not updated. If I move the across the calculated cells with the grid cursor, they magically show their calculated values. Strangely this problem does not manifest itself in the first row of the grid where all the calculated sells are immediately updated when I press enter after inputting a quantity.</P>
<P>I have tried C1 Flexgrid as well and still get the same problem.</P>

If you do the latter, maybe calling PropertyChanged(CalculatedProperty) will solve the problem ?</FONT></P>
