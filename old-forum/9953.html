<p>You can download CSLA 4 version 4.1 at <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx</span></strong></a></p>
<p>Although there are numerous new features in version 4.1, the primary focus of this release is Windows Phone 7. With CSLA 4 version 4.1 you can now author business classes that run unchanged across the entire .NET platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Phone 7</li>
<li>Silverlight</li>
<li>WPF</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC</li>
<li>ASP.NET Web Forms</li>
<li>WCF services (SOAP and REST)</li>
<li>asmx web services</li>
<li>Windows Forms</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to reuse your business layer on .NET, Silverlight and WP7 is incredibly powerful, enabling you to extend your application to users on Windows, the web, and now the phone.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use CSLA 4 to build scalable, flexible, and maintainable applications through the <a href="http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;CategoryID=4&amp;List=1&amp;SortField=DateCreated+DESC%2cProductName&amp;Level=1&amp;ProductID=22"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Using CSLA 4 ebook series</span></strong></a>.

<p>It seems there is some problem with the&nbsp;installer as it complains a newer version is already installed.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, January 19, 2011</h2><p>If you have installed any of the 4.1 pre-release versions you need to uninstall that previous version from Control Panel before installing the release version.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>MichelRenaud replied on Monday, January 24, 2011</h2><p>Hi Rockford,</p>
<p>We&#39;re trying to compile the WPF Project Tracker, but not only was it not in the main solution, but it also generates a bunch of errors.&nbsp; Do you have a working sample?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Michel</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Monday, January 24, 2011</h2><p>That sample is a work in progress and isn&#39;t good right now. Look at SimpleNtier instead.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
