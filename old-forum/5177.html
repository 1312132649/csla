That works OK, but what if I go one level deeper with the transaction? Say each of the objects in my ROLB has its own "PostMe" command that would do all the work of posting one order within its command. Then I could put the transactional attribute at that level and even if the overall process ends up failing somewhere down the line, at least the orders up to that point would get posted. What I would definitely want to avoid is having any one order end up partially posted."</P>
