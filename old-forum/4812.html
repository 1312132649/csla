<P>I have been stumbling around for a long time trying to figure out the best way to deal with enabling<BR>and disabling text fields on the forms of my WinForms application. In particular, I have been unable find a 'clean' way that allows me to disable form fields when a the form is first loaded and I don't <BR>know whether the user wants to add, change, delete or just view a record. Right now I am creating <BR>a new object in the form load event which puts the form in 'new' mode. This works but the users do <BR>not want the forms to automatically open in 'new' mode. </P>
<P>My design is based on Ptracker and I have the new, cancel, save buttons working smoothly&nbsp;thanks <BR>to BindingSource_CurrentItemChanged, CanEditObject, CanDeleteObject IsSaveable, and IsDirty et al. </P>
<P>Any ideas on how to best start up a form with the text fields disabled without having to write <BR>enabled = False/True throughout my form button handling code?&nbsp; What are others doing in this situation.</P>
<P><BR>Thanks in advance</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, May 07, 2008</h2>Hi<br><br>1: Use databinding. The Enabled/Visible and other properties may also be databound so that you may have enabled of controls databound to one or more properties on your BO or Controller.<br>2. Override the CanWriteProperty in your BO to return false when edit is not allowed (thereby making your BO/porperties ReadOnly) and use the ReadWriteAuthorizationManager to set UI Controls enabled/disabled. <br><br>/jonny<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
