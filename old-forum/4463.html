<P>Sorry if this seems like more .NET related than CSLA, but I'm trying to understand the implications of adding custom attributes to my classes. </P>
<P>Since CSLA serializes everything, I'd like to avoid adding unnecessary weight and there are alternative implementations I could use rather than attributes if this will add "fat" to the serialization load. </P>

<P>I was specifically curious about the Criteria classes themselves, which in our case contain a Type object as a field in the instance, so I wasn't sure what was involved in serializing the Type object field in a Criteria class instance around. </P>
<P>In any case, I have some debugging code that tests for serializability and dumps the size of the byte stream out to the debug output, and I don't notice any size change from adding attributes.</P>
