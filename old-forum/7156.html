UserControl's content property is not publicly accessible. <br /><br />An option that I've considered is to introduce a base usercontrol class to provide for some sort of an "IsErrorShown" method, but I'd rather not introduce a base usercontrol class for all my usercontrol objects unless I need to. <br /><br />An interface would seem to require me to implement the same sort of code in every UserControl. <br /><br />Any good ideas or am I looking something obvious? </div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
