<p>CSLA 4 Beta 1 is now available for download. This includes CSLA .NET version 
4 for .NET and Silverlight.</p>

<p>Beta 1 is essentially feature complete. It includes some really big 
(breaking) changes from 3.8.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4Highlights.aspx">list of 
highlights</a>, and of course the <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=3852b8d8-e2f7-4277-b77e-bf375125b6c9">change 
log</a> lists essentially all the changes (with the breaking changes 
highlighted).</p>
<p>The biggest change is the&nbsp;new business, validation and authorization rules 
system (info <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4BusinessRulesSubsystem.aspx">here</a>, 
<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4BusinessRuleChaining.aspx">here</a> 
and <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLA4AuthorizationRules.aspx">here</a>). 
While the new rule system requires changes to your existing business, validation 
and authorization rules code, the new capabilities are pretty amazing and I 
think you&rsquo;ll find it is worth the effort to make the changes.</p>
<p>There are many other changes as well, touching almost every aspect of the 
framework. From new ASP.NET MVC support, to enhanced MVVM support in Silverlight 
and WPF, to addressing many of the most common requests around the data portal, 
CSLA 4 should offer benefits to most application scenarios.</p>
<p>This is a beta 1 release, and is the start of the overall beta-to-release 
process. Based on your feedback using this beta, I expect to do a couple more 
beta releases over the next few weeks, with a final release in about 6-8 weeks 
(so around the end of June).</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m sure there will be changes based on feedback, the focus during the 
beta process is on fixing bugs or addressing anything that is clearly broken. I 
do not anticipate any major feature changes or enhancements during this 
process&nbsp;&ndash; that&rsquo;s what the past few months of pre-releases were all about.</p>
<p>CSLA 4 does require .NET 4 and (optionally) Silverlight 4. It also requires 
Visual Studio 2010. If you are using older versions of Visual Studio, .NET or 
Silverlight then you should continue to use version 3.8.</p>
<p>Please download CSLA 4 Beta 1 and offer bug reports or other feedback using 
the <a>CSLA forum</a>.</p>
