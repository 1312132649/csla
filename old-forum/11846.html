In the read-only object I have overriden the Equals to check for value equality. In the setter of this property I am calling SetProperty(ROProp, value) but it does&#39;t seem to use the Equals method and if I set the property&nbsp; with an instance that has the same values my object will still become dirty.</p>
<p>When I look at the code for BusinessBase it seems to be using the Equals method so I assume I can override Equals in my read-only BO to check for value equality but for whatever reason it isn&#39;t calling my overriden Equals method.</p>
<p>Is there something I&#39;m missing? Should I be checking for equality manually in the setter before calling SetProperty?</p>
<p>Thanks for the help,</p>
