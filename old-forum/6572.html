Thus far no one has jumped at the chance to provide technical content for the FAQ though :)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>sroberts replied on Monday, March 09, 2009</h2>Rocky,<br><br>Perhaps the discussion about the Wiki/FAQ missed some peoples attention. How about a new posting from yourself to ask for FAQ write up's, I'm sure there are some people in the community that would be more than happy to submit one or two without having to commit to any sort of regular responsibility to maintain it.<br><br>I'd be happy to submit a couple of the more elementary WinForms gotchas that I've run into and had solved by the community, although I'd probably get embarassing lost trying to help with any of the more exotic uses of CSLA !<br><br>I'll get them written and email them across to you for review soon.<br><br><br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
