<p>I discovered this when trying to make a go of using the built-in indexing the class provides, only to discover it wasn&#39;t finding the new entries being added to the list if the indexed property was subsequently changed. </p>
<p>What was the rationale behind only hooking the existing child objects? Am I missing something?</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
