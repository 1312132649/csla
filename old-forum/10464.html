<ol>
<li>Would partial classes be the way to go, seperating project type specific code in seperate files (i.e. Customer.Common.vb, Customer.WF.vb, Customer.WPF.vb, etc) and include the appropriate files in each project?</li>
<li>What about using conditional compilation statements to group different implementations? Would this work?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 24, 2011</h2><p>fwiw, I discuss this at some length in the <em>Using CSLA 4</em> ebook series, and all the sample code is written to demonstrate how the same code can be used to build business assemblies for .NET, Silverlight, and Windows Phone.</p>
<p>You can also look at the SimpleNTier sample app in the Samples\Net\cs folder, because it has web, Windows, Silverlight and WP7 front ends.</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
