If I run the app from the actual server machine itself, it works fine. When I have the client set up on a different PC, I get a SecurityNegotiationException - caller was not authenticated by the service. I've tried tweaking my app.config and web.config files based on various advice but no luck so far. Has anyone come across this and come to a definitive answer for what was wrong? I don't have a whole lot of experience in WCF or network security, so the more detailed the explanation the better.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dennis</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dtabako replied on Friday, June 12, 2009</h2>OK, I think I've got it. I basically looked at ProjectTracker and stripped my config files down to what's in there. Then I added a 'security mode="None"' entry on both client and server and now it all works. Thanks anyway.<br /><br />Dennis</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, June 12, 2009</h2><A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/DataPortalFaq.ashx">http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/DataPortalFaq.ashx</A></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
