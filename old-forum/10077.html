<p>I&#39;m using the latest version of Telerik WPF controls and I&#39;m seeing an odd behavior with the RadDataPicker. If I have a business rule that should execute upon leaving the control, the business rule is never executed, if I do a BO.Cancel the control is never rolled back.</p>
<p>If I replace the Telerik control with a standard Windows DatePicker everything works as expected.</p>
<p>I would like to better understand the process so that I can report the problem to Telerik, for example what happens when a BO.Cancel is called, or when a user leaves a field and a business rule should fire.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
