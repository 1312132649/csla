I've read the note at the top of the DataPortal method that says "   <br />  ''' If the server-side DataPortal is running remotely, this will be a new and<br />  ''' different object from the original, and all object references MUST be updated<br />  ''' to use this new object.<br />", but I am unsure if this is the case for me or what technique I would use to reload an object whose Id is missing. <br /><br />Also, one think I've noticed is that although I am using TransactionScope, the DataPortal says I am using Manual. Could this have something to do with it?<br /><br />I'm relatively new to CSLA's DataPortal, so any explanations, long or short, will be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, November 24, 2009</h2><P>You need to use the result of the Save() call in your client code:</P>
<P>obj = obj.Save()</P>
<P>The data portal returns a new object as a result of Save(), and it is that new object that has the updated values (like your new id value) from the save operation.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ByeByeDelRay replied on Wednesday, November 25, 2009</h2>Rocky,<br /><br />Thanks for the reply. <br /><br />I am definitely doing that, but I forgot to mention that I am saving a collection, and that the objects that are losing their ids are child objects. Would that make a difference?<br /><br />_allocations is a BusinessListBase(Of LaborAllocations, LaborAllocation). The client app calls _allocations = _allocations.Save:<br /><br />-- Class LaborAllocations<br />Public Overrides Function Save() As LaborAllocations<br />	Return MyBase.Save()<br />End Function<br /><br />Protected Overrides Sub DataPortal_Update()<br /><br />	For Each allocation As LaborAllocation In Me<br />		allocation.SourceId = Me.SourceId<br />		allocation = allocation.Save()<br />	Next<br /><br />End Sub<br /><br />-- Class LaborAllocation<br />Public Overrides Function Save() As LaborAllocation<br />	Return MyBase.Save()<br />End Function<br /><br />Protected Overrides Sub DataPortal_Insert()<br />	Dim params As SqlParameters = GetUpsertParams()<br />	SqlHelper.ExecuteNonQuery(Config.ConnectionStrings.LaborAllocationConnectionString, CommandType.StoredProcedure, "ALLOCATION_INSERT", params.ToArray)<br />	_id = CInt(params("@Id").Value)<br />End Sub<br /><br /></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, November 25, 2009</h2>You can't call Save() on a child object. In fact you should get an exception<br />when trying to do so, and since you aren't getting an exception you are<br />probably not correctly creating your child objects.<br /><br />Please review Chapters 3-6 in Expert 2008 Business Objects to see how child<br />objects should be implemented.</div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
