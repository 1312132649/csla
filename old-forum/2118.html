<P>How would I make this rule work in CSLA 2.0?&nbsp; I would need the rule to fire everytime Status or CompletedDate changes.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Brian Criswell replied on Thursday, January 11, 2007</h2>CSLA 2.1 added a new method for adding dependent rules/properties.&nbsp; Check the changelog.<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
