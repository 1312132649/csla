<P>I'm looking for some help to make my app more secure. Currently I'm using the login form from PTTracker. So I'm wondering whether anyone has any idea how I can lockdown the login form so it's not spoofable and passwords are not passed around in the clear. Is there a windows login dialog that can be called? I have been looking at changing all the string variables to SecureString.</P>
<P>Any help would greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>Thanks</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>dean replied on Thursday, September 13, 2007</h2>This is an article from 2006 about secure login:<br><br>http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/show/4693/<br><br>Haven't used it but thought I would pass it along.<br><br>Dean<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, September 14, 2007</h2>The normal solution, and the one I'd recommend, is to use SSL for the login.aspx page. That's what most web sites do, because SSL is a well understood and trusted protocol that solves the whole issue.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ozitraveller replied on Sunday, September 16, 2007</h2><P>Thanks Rocky and dean.</P>
<P>I wish winform security was as easy to implement as webforms so I could use something like ssl, but alas, I'm only using winforms. And most of the articles I've seen still use string to pass the password around, pre-SecureString. I been to the pluralsight site and found Keth Brown's example: prompting for a password. Good but still only an example.</P>
<P>The '<SPAN>Credential Management API </SPAN>' example looks promising, maybe I can use some of it, as I am only interested in the secure dialog returning a securestring. I could change the Keth Brown example it's in C++.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Sunday, September 16, 2007</h2>






 

 
  
 




<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I did assume web.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>But Windows is typically easier. The only time your
username/password combo would go across the wire in that setting is through the
data portal. Again, the typical answer is to use SSL to protect the data
flowing across the network &#8211; and you can use SSL and the data portal with
the WCF, Remoting and Web services channels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The EnterpriseServices channel can also be encrypted &#8211;
that&#8217;s just a setting in the COM+ application dialog on the server.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>The WCF channel can also be encrypted using WCF encryption &#8211;
based on WS-Security I believe &#8211; which is much like SSL in that it is
certificate based.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Passing the string around <i>inside your WinForms app itself</i>
is kind of a non-issue, because that&#8217;s inside the same AppDomain at all
times. Since the unencrypted string must, at some point, be available to your
code, the key to decrypt the string would also need to be available within the
AppDomain &#8211; meaning you can&#8217;t <i>actually</i> encrypt the value &#8211;
all you can do is use a &#8220;fancy&#8221; form of obfuscation or encoding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>In other words, it is kind of silly to encrypt the value in
memory, because the key is there too &#8211; and any hacker who has access to your
private fields to get at the encrypted string can, by definition, get at the
private field containing the key&#8230;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>So all you can really do is protect the value on the wire &#8211;
where it is more vulnerable anyway (assuming a hacker can put a tap on your
network) &#8211; and that&#8217;s easily handled through SSL.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
