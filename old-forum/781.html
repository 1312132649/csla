<P>Pretty much everything work ok, except 2 things I am wondering if I can change.</P>
<P>1) When modifying a textbox in the grid, you have to either click on another row or hit the enter key for those changes to make it back to my list object.&nbsp; So if you edit a textbox and click the Save button, it will actually not save what you have typed (because you didn't hit enter).</P>
<P>Is there a way to do this so that you don't have to hit enter?</P>
<P>2) I am using the BindingNavigator for the Add, Delete, and Save buttons. Add and Delete do what you would expect w/o any code by me.&nbsp; But, "Save" doesn't really do anything.&nbsp; I can easily get around it by catching the save click event and manually saving, but I am wondering if I did something wrong that the Save button doesn't automaticlly cause my BusinessListBase to save?</P>

<P>Thanks, I will give that a try.</P>
<P>I guess if I ever get (2) working,&nbsp;I guess it&nbsp;will either automatically cal EndEdit ( I hope ).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cmay replied on Tuesday, August 01, 2006</h2><P>I found that calling EndEdit on the datasource didn't help.&nbsp; I had to call it directly on the datagrid like this:</P>
<P>Me.MyDataGridView.EndEdit()</P>
