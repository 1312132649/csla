<p class=MsoNormal>One weakness of silverlight at the moment seems to be the
lack of unit testing options compared to dotNet. From what I can see both NUnit
and MbUnit doesn't support it.<br>
For consistency I would prefer to use the same framework for my dotNet and
silverlight tests. I don't know much about the Microsoft testing framework and
I've heard some bad things about it but it has probably matured since then.<br>
One problem I do have with it is the testing program is integrated into the
IDE. Although that has some advantages I've found that it's more trouble than
it's worth. Too many times when I've used that setup I've being stepping

database and manually clean it up). I much prefer the NUnit runner separate and

I know that Rocky has written UnitDriven.NET but there really isn't a lot of
documentation on it. What's the best setup for testing a silverlight, dotNet
solution?<br>
