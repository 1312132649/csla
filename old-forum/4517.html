I made some modifications recently that used a grid and an edit root with children. I'm only binding the children (businesslistbase and BusinessBase with markaschild) to the grid. Sometimes (not all the time), when I save, I get the "object is still being edited" error. I am unbinding the grid as explained in the version 3.0 update. This is an Invoice/Invoice Detail list type object/relationship. I'm not calling any begin edits myself so it must be the grid/bindsource. The grid is readonly but the data is getting edited in the background. Do I also need to unbind the Invoice even though it is never bound to anything? Like I said, this doesn't happen all the time. Intermittent would be more accurate to describe it.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Wednesday, March 19, 2008</h2>You should probably also upgrade to 3.0.3, because there are several bug fixes related to databinding in Csla.&nbsp; <br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Misled replied on Wednesday, March 19, 2008</h2>3.03 requires the latest version of the .NET framework doesn't it?

The 2.1 and 3.0 supplimental e-books outline the changes and the samples give a good start.</P>
