<P><FONT face=Arial>"Mobile objects are an incredibly powerful technique for exploiting the power of object-oriented design and programming in distributed environments. The CSLA .NET data portal abstracts the complexity of this concept. The result is that your application can switch between 1-tier, 2-tier, 3-tier and even <STRONG>4-tier</STRONG> models with no change to code - the change is purely one of configuration."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>I searched the forum but found nothing about this subject. How would Csla work in 4 tier mode?</FONT></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cds replied on Friday, October 09, 2009</h2>Hi Tiago<br /><br />I believe this page explains it: http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/UsingCSLALightPart1.aspx<br /><br />Cheers...<br /><br />Craig</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>rsbaker0 replied on Friday, October 09, 2009</h2>Browser <br /><br />Web Server (client side of CSLA data portal)<br /><br />Application Server (server side of CSLA data portal)<br /><br />Database</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Friday, October 09, 2009</h2><P>The CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series walks through the 4-tier deployment model end-to-end (<A href="http://store.lhotka.net">http://store.lhotka.net</A>).</P>

<P>The data portal is all interface-based and uses a provider model. So you can create a custom host that does nothing but relay the client call back into the data portal - thus acting as a relay/router on the public server.</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
