<P class=MsoNormal>This release is mainly focusing on split class support. These templates are now fully support two generation methods: abstract/base class and partial class.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Thanks to Rocky for adding various improvement in version 2.0.1 framework to make code generator also a first class citizen.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>After toying around with several options to implement hooks for partial class, I have chosen to use delegate.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I’ve decided to use delegate for its simplicity and performance.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I created a test and found that delegate actually perform very close to overriding virtual method and not so far behind calling direct method.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I hope this will work well on real application, so please share us your experience when using this method.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>This release is also fix various reported bugs and bugs found by me after doing more testing.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>So thanks to people that reporting these bugs and keep them coming…</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Enjoy,</P>
