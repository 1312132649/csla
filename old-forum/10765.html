<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, remember, I am the sole developer and our parent company is giving me NO support (they are running a 30 year old AS/400 written by someone who retired 4 years ago, but still comes in 2 weeks a month because nobody else can maintain the system.&nbsp; Yea, lots of fun:)</p>

<p>You&#39;ve said that you had gotten to a good point around Feb/March - conceivably you either have projects that are live or you&#39;re substantially down the road.&nbsp; For us, the same sort of revelation came upon us - most of the way towards a really robust SL application only to have open questions surface as to&nbsp;the technology we were using.</p>
<p>Starting new, presumably we&#39;re talking .NET, it&#39;s really three options at this point we&#39;re usually talking about, right - ASP.Net, WPF, or SL. </p>
<p>I think WPF is an easy one to lop off the list presuming your application doesn&#39;t require the full features of WPF.&nbsp; It seems to have the least bit of &quot;hope&quot; when it comes to moving to additional form factors, Metro, etc at present time; plus, when using CSLA you really aren&#39;t taking a big hit in terms of development efficiency if you&#39;re using SL instead.</p>
<p>When debating SL and ASP.Net - for my scenario at least - the application I&#39;m involved with is a &quot;next-generation&quot; from a VB6 application which - while old - is still pretty rich and interactive.&nbsp; I am not knowledgable in MVC (though I&#39;ve done some decent work in ASP.Net) but I just can&#39;t imagine being 30%-40% of where we are right now in our development if we&#39;d have used ASP.Net and there is no way the richness of the application would come close to what we&#39;ve done in SL.</p>
<p>While SL in its own right may not be the long term panacea, it certainly does seem that we have a really good possibility of retaining a great deal of our code in a translation to a WinRT app.&nbsp; That&#39;s pretty exciting.&nbsp; I think if there wasn&#39;t that avenue, things would be looking a little more bleak.</p>
<p>If I were starting a new LOB application today without huge reach demands&nbsp;and it commanded a lot of richness (depending on the application of course), I would still choose Silverlight with the idea that it&#39;s getting me a great portion of the way to having a WinRT application, and that I can really develop tremendously rich applications&nbsp;quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>The Silverlight --&gt; WinRT path existing is a big draw; it&#39;s like a safety valve in some ways for my Silverlight application.&nbsp; I sure hope it ends up being as manageable as the sentiment seems to indicate.</p>
