<p>I&#39;ve copied the connectionStrings, appSettings and membership stuff from the web.config of the WCFAppServer website to the web.config of the MVC website. (I&#39;ve done something like this back in the day with WindowsForms which worked).</p>
<p>Everything compiles but when I login in the MVC app I get this error:</p>
<p>&quot;An exception of type &#39;Csla.DataPortalException&#39; occurred in Csla.dll but was not handled in user code. &nbsp;Additional information: DataPortal.Fetch failed (Type ProjectTracker.DalEf.DalManager,ProjectTracker.DalEf could not be found)&quot;</p>
<p>I assume the problem is in my web.config file, so I&#39;ve attached it. Another pair of eyes would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Wednesday, October 15, 2014</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>The problem is most likely that the ProjectTracker.DalEf.dll assembly is not in your web apps \bin folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to add this project as Reference in your web application and run again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>cjherasmus replied on Thursday, October 16, 2014</h2><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I did as you&#39;ve suggested. Now when I login I get a StackOverflowException in the DalManager with typeName pointing to UserDal.</p>
<p>Regards</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>JonnyBee replied on Thursday, October 16, 2014</h2><p>Yes, that is a known issue in the implementation in login. You need to do a minor change there.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:lightgreen'><h2>cjherasmus replied on Wednesday, November 05, 2014</h2><p>Done.
