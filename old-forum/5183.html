<P>First Edition (Expert C# Business Objects)&nbsp;- ISBN: 1590593448</P>

<P>The 2nd book is dated 2005 so it is the CSLA 2.x book.</P>
<P>Given that, the 2005 book has many new concepts in it.</P>
<P>Later editions of the 2005 book may have errata fixed.</P>
<P>HTH</P>

<P>They may have applied some errata to reprints of the 2005 book, I'm not sure. Apress tries to keep errata, but more of it flows directly to me than to them, so the errata list on my web site is far more complete than anything they have.</P>
<P>I imagine the 2008 book will be the "3rd edition", but it will be a large rewrite too. I'm sure that'll continue the confusion :)</P></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
