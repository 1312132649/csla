It then complained that www.lhotka.net was not a valid URL and wannted the http:// to be included.<br>5 - After that, it issues the following errors about missing files:<br>ERROR: Unable to build module 'Progress' because the resource specified for 'BannerBitmap' was not found in the project.<br>ERROR: Unable to build module 'License Agreement' because the resource specified for 'BannerBitmap' was not found in the project.<br>ERROR: Unable to build module 'License Agreement' because the resource specified for 'LicenseFile' was not found in the project.<br>ERROR: Unable to build module 'Confirm Installation' because the resource specified for 'BannerBitmap' was not found in the project.<br>ERROR: Unable to build module 'Welcome' because the resource specified for 'BannerBitmap' was not found in the project.<br>ERROR: Unable to build module 'Installation Folder' because the resource specified for 'BannerBitmap' was not found in the project.<br>ERROR: Unable to build module 'Checkboxes&nbsp;&nbsp; (A)' because the resource specified for 'BannerBitmap' was not found in the project.<br>ERROR: Unable to build module 'Finished' because the resource specified for 'BannerBitmap' was not found in the project.<br>Build process cancelled<br>I guess that I cah phony-up some files to satisfy the build configuration but I assume you intended that the download would actually work.<br><br>Your help would be appreciated,<br>Dan<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DanEssin replied on Wednesday, December 31, 2008</h2>I got thie setup to build (maybe).

<P>It would be really nice to have an msi for CSLA, but it turns out to be a lot of work to create and maintain, and it hasn't floated anywhere near the top of my to-do list.

<p class=MsoNormal>Hi,<br>
Thanks for the info - it certainly helps. I guess I made relatively good
progress with it considering I got the prebuild stuff to execute, and got the
vsi to install the templates.. <br>
<br>
Based on your guidance I will leave it at that and get to work on the basics.
Any tips on the choice of a data-aware template generator?<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
