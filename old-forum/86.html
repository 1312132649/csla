<P>But I set up my account (or at least tried to) over a week ago and elected to receive e-mails of all the messages here.&nbsp; I haven't received a single one. </P>
<P>I just returned from a week-long business trip and expected to see a flood of CSLA email.&nbsp; What a surprise to see NONE!</P>
<P>Also, is Rocky interested in a clean up crew here when the spam starts coming in like we had at the old site?</P>

Obviously the site setup is new and there are a few quirks. In the case of the emails, the service shut itself down due to a socket error (which seems like an extreme response to a common issue). I had no way to restart it while out of the country. Once I did get it restarted it ran for 1.5 hours to deliver all the queued emails <img src="/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile [:D]" />.</P>
<P>And yes, once I figure out what role an anti-spam person should have I would very much like to have a clean-up crew like on the old site! Though CS 2.0 has some built-in anti-spam, there's no doubt that some manual intervention will be required.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>CSLA101 replied on Saturday, May 13, 2006</h2><P>Apologize if this is on another thread:</P>
<P>fyi... </P>
<P>- the login page doesn't remember the login.</P>
<P>- can we attach files here?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, May 13, 2006</h2><P>Apparently there's a known bug/issue with CS 2.0 regarding the failure to remember logins. Apparently there's also a fix for it, which I'll hopefully track down when I get done with this round of travel.</P>
<P>At the moment there's no ability to attach files. In looking at it, that feature exists but appears to be turned off by default. When I get a chance I'll see about turning it on (I don't know if it is as easy as flipping an admin switch or not - but if it is, then it'll be sooner than later <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" />)</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Saturday, May 13, 2006</h2>OK, I think attachments should work now (crossing fingers).</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Wednesday, May 17, 2006</h2><P>FYI, I'm still not getting any e-mails.&nbsp; I may not have had an existing account for all I know during that furious hour and a half period you mentioned.&nbsp; But I've had one for the last couple of days at least and still have yet to receive one.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 17, 2006</h2><P>You do need to enable the email support for the forum for your account. On the main forum page you'll see a graphic box for email right next to the one for RSS. Click that to turn on email for the forum.</P>
<P>I know the email is working, because I've been getting lots of emails every day (I usually don't prefer to go the email route, but I've left it on so I can more easily ensure that it is working - at least in the short term).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Q Johnson replied on Wednesday, May 17, 2006</h2><P>Very cool.&nbsp; I was confused at first because it didn't show up when I wasn't logged in.&nbsp; But, duh, I finally worked it out and signed in and opted in.</P>
<P>Now I'm going to go look for the forum manual I saw mentioned in the Admin forum posting (where someone got to introduce a member to the RTFM phrase for the first time - a rarity, I believe!).</P>
<P>Thanks, Rocky.</P>
