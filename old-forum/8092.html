Also the solutions posted in that thread didn't solve my problem.<br /><br />To specify I tried using the .Clone() method.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 04, 2009</h2>But its the same issue.&nbsp; The edit levels don't match due to databinding, and when you clone it still keeps the same edit level values as the original.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jnthomas replied on Friday, December 04, 2009</h2>When you assign the Child to the new Parent through SetProperty() it rebinds the Child to the new Parent and then calls ResetChildEditLevel() which resets the EditLevel to the new Parent. At least that's what the book states, and my traces confirm it. So I'm wondering how it goes back to the original values as you stated. I'm clearly missing something.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Friday, December 04, 2009</h2>But you're doing this all while databound, correct?&nbsp; You can't do things "behind databinding's back," so to speak.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>jnthomas replied on Friday, December 04, 2009</h2>So you can't clone an object that is databound? Why would that be?<br /><br /></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
