1. Build the solution
First of all, build the solution (CTRL+SHIT+B) or else the server folder will be missing 
the implementation assemblies of the Data Access Layer (DAL).

2. Set ProjectTracker.Ui.WPF as Startup Project

3. Start the Application Server
Debug with F5 to start the application server (ProjectTracker.AppServerHost).
After it's started, you can break the debug and run normally with CTRL F5.

Note 1 - This project uses a local application server at http://localhost:11170
(have a look at ProjectTracker.Ui.WPF App.config)

Note 2 - The application server ProjectTracker.AppServerHost
is using ProjectTracker.DalMock assembly to mock a database table.
