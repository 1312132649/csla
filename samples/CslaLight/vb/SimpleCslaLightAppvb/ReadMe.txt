To get this solution running, you must do the following:

1. In the SimpleAppWeb web site, add a reference to System.Web.Silverlight

2. Set SimpleAppWeb as the startup project

3. Set the SimpleAppTestPage.aspx as the startup page

4. Double-check the port number to make sure the 
   IP port of SimpleAppWeb is 1406. 
   If not, then you need to alter the port 
   in SimpleApp\ServiceReferences.ClientConfig
   to match the port number of SimpleAppWeb.
